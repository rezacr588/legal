# ‚úÖ ALIGNMENT VERIFIED: Generator API ‚Üî Training Notebook

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: **FULLY ALIGNED AND WORKING**

---

## üéØ Summary

**Your generator API and training notebook are now perfectly aligned!**

The generator creates samples with correct `sample_type` values, and the training notebook formats them appropriately for each type. The model will learn to recognize and use 4 different answer structures.

---

## ‚úÖ All 4 Sample Types Work This Way

### 1. `case_analysis` (IRAC)
- **Generator prompt**: "Your answer MUST follow this exact structure: ‚îÇ ISSUE: ... ‚îÇ RULE: ... ‚îÇ APPLICATION: ... ‚îÇ CONCLUSION: ..."
- **Training format**: `### Answer (IRAC: Issue ‚Üí Rule ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Conclusion):`
- **Model learns**: Use IRAC for problem-solving scenarios

### 2. `educational` (Teaching)
- **Generator prompt**: "Your answer should follow this teaching structure: ‚îÇ DEFINITION: ... ‚îÇ LEGAL BASIS: ... ‚îÇ KEY ELEMENTS: ... ‚îÇ EXAMPLES: ..."
- **Training format**: `### Answer (Teaching: Definition ‚Üí Legal Basis ‚Üí Key Elements ‚Üí Examples):`
- **Model learns**: Use teaching format for concept explanations

### 3. `client_interaction` (Practical Advice)
- **Generator prompt**: "Your answer should follow this practical structure: ‚îÇ UNDERSTANDING: ... ‚îÇ LEGAL POSITION: ... ‚îÇ OPTIONS: ... ‚îÇ RECOMMENDATION: ..."
- **Training format**: `### Answer (Client Advice: Understanding ‚Üí Position ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Recommendation):`
- **Model learns**: Use client-friendly format for practical advice

### 4. `statutory_interpretation` (Legislative Analysis)
- **Generator prompt**: "Your answer should follow this interpretive structure: ‚îÇ STATUTORY TEXT: ... ‚îÇ PURPOSE: ... ‚îÇ INTERPRETATION: ... ‚îÇ CASE LAW: ..."
- **Training format**: `### Answer (Statutory: Text ‚Üí Purpose ‚Üí Interpretation ‚Üí Case Law):`
- **Model learns**: Use statutory format for legislation questions

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Generator API (`services/generation_service.py`)

**Lines 188-203**: Dynamic structure validation
```python
if sample_type == 'case_analysis':
    structure_validation = "‚òê 2. IRAC structure: Answer follows Issue ‚Üí Rule ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Conclusion"
elif sample_type == 'educational':
    structure_validation = "‚òê 2. Educational structure: Answer follows Definition ‚Üí Legal Basis ‚Üí Key Elements ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Distinctions"
# ... etc for other types
```

**Line 310**: Sample type in JSON output
```python
"sample_type": "{sample_type}"
```

**Lines 355-357**: Ensure sample_type is always present
```python
if 'sample_type' not in sample:
    sample['sample_type'] = sample_type
```

### Training Notebook (`sft-law-book-simple-multigpu.ipynb`)

**Cell 7, line ~12**: Sample type detection
```python
sample_type = sample.get('sample_type', 'case_analysis')
```

**Cell 7, line ~20**: Sample type in training format
```python
response = f"""
### Sample Type: {sample_type}
### Topic: {sample.get('topic', 'Corporate Law')}
...
```

**Cell 7, lines ~41-48**: Type-specific hints
```python
type_hints = {
    'case_analysis': '(IRAC: Issue ‚Üí Rule ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Conclusion)',
    'educational': '(Teaching: Definition ‚Üí Legal Basis ‚Üí Key Elements ‚Üí Examples)',
    'client_interaction': '(Client Advice: Understanding ‚Üí Position ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Recommendation)',
    'statutory_interpretation': '(Statutory: Text ‚Üí Purpose ‚Üí Interpretation ‚Üí Case Law)'
}

hint = type_hints.get(sample_type, '')

response += f"""
### Answer {hint}:
{sample['answer']}"""
```

**Cell 16**: Gradio inference UI with sample type selector
```python
sample_type_selector = gr.Radio(
    choices=["case_analysis", "educational", "client_interaction", "statutory_interpretation"],
    value="case_analysis",
    label="üìä Answer Format"
)
```

## üéì How Training Will Work

### Before Training (Current Baseline)
**Your existing model** (trained only on case_analysis/IRAC):
- User: "What is consideration?"
- Model: "**ISSUE**: The question asks about consideration. **RULE**: Consideration is defined in Currie v Misa..."
- Problem: Always uses IRAC even for teaching questions

### After Training (Multi-Format Model)
**Your new model** (trained on 4 sample types):

**Example 1**: User selects `educational`
- User: "What is consideration?"
- Prompt includes: `### Sample Type: educational`
- Model: "**DEFINITION**: Consideration is the price for a promise. **LEGAL BASIS**: Currie v Misa [1875] defined it as... **KEY ELEMENTS**: 1. Must have value, 2. Must move from promisee..."
- ‚úÖ Uses teaching format

**Example 2**: User selects `case_analysis`
- User: "My client paid ¬£1 for a promise. Is there consideration?"
- Prompt includes: `### Sample Type: case_analysis`
- Model: "**ISSUE**: Whether nominal consideration of ¬£1 is sufficient. **RULE**: Under Chappell & Co v Nestle [1960], consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate..."
- ‚úÖ Uses IRAC format

**Example 3**: User selects `client_interaction`
- User: "My client wants to know if they should proceed with this contract"
- Prompt includes: `### Sample Type: client_interaction`
- Model: "**UNDERSTANDING**: I understand your client is considering whether to enter this contract. **LEGAL POSITION**: Under UK law, they are not obligated until they accept... **OPTIONS**: Option 1: Proceed with standard terms... Option 2: Negotiate modifications... **RECOMMENDATION**: Given the circumstances, I recommend..."
- ‚úÖ Uses client-friendly format

**Ready for training?** Not yet - you need more balance.

**Minimum for meaningful training**: 100+ samples per type

**Ideal for production**: 500-1,000 samples per type

---

## üöÄ What You Can Do Now

### 1. Generate More Samples

**Via API** (batch generation):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/generate/batch/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_count": 7600,
    "provider": "cerebras",
    "model": "gpt-oss-120b",
    "sample_type": "educational"
  }'
```

**Via UI** (manual, high quality):
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Go to Generation tab
3. Select sample_type, topic, difficulty
4. Generate and review

**Via Script** (automated bootstrap):
```bash
python3 bootstrap_cerebras.py  # Generates 3 per type
```

### 2. Train the Model

Once you have 100+ samples per type:

1. **Open training notebook**: `sft-law-book-simple-multigpu.ipynb`
2. **Run all cells** - the notebook is already configured!
3. **Wait for training** (~30-60 min on 2x T4 GPUs)
4. **Test in Gradio** - Cell 16 has sample type selector

### 3. Evaluate Results

After training, test each sample type:
- Ask the same question with different sample_types
- Verify the model adapts its answer structure
- Compare quality across formats
