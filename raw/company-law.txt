Preface to the fifteenth edition
The major feature of this edition has been the continued exploration and analysis of the
impact of the Companies Act 2006. The introduction of the 2006 Act has, quite literally, represented a â€˜wholesale rethinkâ€™ of modern company law and, as such, had a significant impact
on every aspect of the subject area. While this represents an exciting and challenging period
for practitioners, academics and students alike, it has nonetheless meant that our considerable reworking of the fourteenth edition has been continued in order to keep pace with the
changes brought about by the new Act.
By now the majority of readers will be sufficiently familiar with the new section numbering of the 2006 Act or, as in the case of the majority of students, will be approaching this area
for the first time since continued references to the 1985 Act have become redundant.
Consequently, details of the Companies Act 1985 have either been removed entirely or, in
specific chapters, been retained only where a comparison with the previous wording is absolutely necessary.
In addition, we have sought to continue our analysis of the fundamental change in
approach to corporate regulation at the small and medium-sized company level, which the
Companies Act 2006 has represented. This has not only impacted on the chapters dealing
with shares and the capital of companies but also the internal management and operations of
companies. In this regard, the new Model Articles that accompany the 2006 Act, and which
have replaced Table Aas the template for corporate constitutions from 1 October 2009, represent a dramatic shift away from the â€˜one size fits allâ€™ mentality to that of a â€˜think small firstâ€™
approach, providing bespoke model articles for private companies limited by shares, private
companies limited by guarantee, and public companies limited by shares. However, Table A
remains an important consideration when dealing with any company incorporated before
this date. Consequently, we have sought to introduce the new Model Articles, together with
their impact on the day-to-day management and running of both public and private companies while, at the same time, maintaining a thorough analysis of Table Awith respect to a
companyâ€™s constitution. Given the complexity of this issue, the natural overlap between the
various Model Articles, as well as the obvious need to compare and contrast Table Awith the
new Model Articles, we have inserted Appendices which contain copies of these documents.
Readers are referred to them throughout the text to help them to familarise themselves with
these key provisions.
We have continued to expand and enrich reference to case law throughout. This includes
current cases relating to the new statutory derivative action and the unfair prejudice head, as
well as a broader analysis of traditional common law and equitable duties imposed on directors, which underpin the statutory duties introduced by the 2006 Act. As with the previous
edition, this is supported by reference to an increased selection of academic articles at the end
of certain chapters, in order to ensure that the text is as current and relevant as possible for
Finally, this edition includes an extended analysis of the constitution of a company, in the
light of the new Model Articles, as well as a significant reworking of the section dealing with

Preface to the fifteenth edition
directorsâ€™ duties and management of the company. We have also reworked the chapter focusing on meetings and resolutions so as to set down a comprehensive, yet easily accessible,
account of the procedures and processes introduced by the Companies Act 2006 and which
are at the heart of this subject area. In addition, the chapters on minority protection and the
statutory derivative action have been reworked to provide the reader with greater detail and
insight into the processes involved as well as current case law.
We would like to thank those members of staff at Pearson Education who have helped to
produce this edition, particularly Zoe Botterill, Acquisitions Editor - Law, and Gabriella
Playford. We would also like to thank Mary Keenan for her continued support with the ongoing development of this book. Our thanks are also due to those who designed, set, printed and
bound the book.
We would also like to thank our respective families who have shown considerable patience
and understanding over the past few months. The production of any text requires a significant
support network and for that we are both truly grateful.
Any errors and omissions at the level at which the text is aimed are down to the authors.

The nature of a company

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
This text is concerned almost entirely with the law relating to registered companies
which, in turn, are governed in the main by the Companies Act 2006 and relevant case
law. Section references have been cut to a minimum, but those that do appear relate to the
Companies Act 2006 unless otherwise indicated.
As regards corporate insolvency, section references are to the Insolvency Act 1986. Here,
again, a number of the sections quoted were not in the original Act but have been inserted by
subsequent statutory instruments and, in particular, by the Enterprise Act 2002. Furthermore,
where a case is quoted and its date is before the company legislation that it illustrates, it was
decided on identical (or similar) legislation which is now consolidated into the 2006 Act. This
is why a case decided in 1936 can still be used to illustrate a provision in the 2006 Act.
General features
Since a company is a corporation, it is necessary first to examine the nature of a corporation. A corporation is a succession or collection of persons having at law an existence, rights
and duties, separate and distinct from those of the persons who are from time to time its
The distinguishing features of a corporation are:
(a) It is a persona at law (i.e. an artificial legal entity and not a natural person) which in
certain circumstances may prevent it from making a successful claim for harm inflicted
upon it. For instance, in DPPv Dziurzynski(2002) The Times, 8 July, a prosecution was
brought against D, an animal-rights protestor, for harassing a company (B & K Universal
Group Ltd) by filming its vehicles going in and out of its premises and making abusive
remarks. The company brought a prosecution through the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. The Divisional Court of the Queenâ€™s
Bench ruled that the prosecution failed because a company could not be regarded as a
â€˜personâ€™ for these purposes. The Act envisaged harassment of a human being.
(b) It has perpetual succe ssion, i.e. its existence is maintained by the constant succession of
new persons who replace those who die or are in some other way removed.
This means that even though a member dies, goes bankrupt, or retires from the company by
transferring his shares, the company carries on and is not dissolved. By contrast, an ordinary
partnership is dissolved when a partner dies or goes bankrupt, or retires. The business will
usually continue under the remaining partners but the retiring partner is entitled, subject to
what the partnership agreement says, to be paid his share in the firm. The executor of a
deceased partner and the trustee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt partner are also entitled to payment of the relevant share.
This results in a return of capital in a partnership and can effect some dislocation of the
business, but although this can be reduced by clauses in the articles of partnership, e.g.
deferred payment, the problem cannot be totally eliminated, and provision must be made.
The same does not happen in companies. A retiring shareholder must find a purchaser for the
shares, as must the executors and trustee in bankruptcy. A company can purchase its own
shares but is not forced to do so.
A limited liability partnership (LLP) registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships
Act 2000 is more like a company than an ordinary partnership in that it has a separate

Background to limited liability
existence at law, i.e. is a persona at law with its own property and liabilities separate from its
members (not partners). The retirement of a member, therefore, will not effect a dissolution
of the LLP but there may be problems in terms of the repayment of the retiring memberâ€™s
capital. It is important, therefore, that the members of the LLP make an effective and valid
agreement between themselves before the LLP is registered and incorporated. That failing,
the default provisions of Regs 7 and 8 of the Limited Liability Partnerships Regulations 2001
apply under which all members of an LLP are entitled to share equally in the capital and
profits of the firm, and in the absence of a special member agreement would be entitled to the
return of it on retirement. The members of an LLP do not hold saleable shares in the LLP and
the procedure for the retirement of members and the admission of new members should
appear in the pre-registration agreement, otherwise the retirement of a member and the
admission of a member take place â€˜in accordance with any agreement made in a particular
case with the other members of the LLPâ€™.
Background to limited liability
Company law in its modern form may be traced back to the mid-nineteenth century and the
enactment of the Limited Liability Act and Joint Stock Companies Acts. However, an array
of business associations developed long before this time, among which was the common
law construct of the partnerships. However, as England sought to expand its international
trade activities across the globe, the government sought to create corporations under Royal
Charters and Acts of Parliament, granting monopolies over specified territories; the best
known example being the East India Company.
A similar chartered company, the South Sea Company, was established in 1711 in order
to undertake trade with the Spanish South American colonies. However, it met with far less
success than the British East India Company. The South Sea Companyâ€™s monopoly rights
were based on the Treaty of Utrecht which purported to grant the United Kingdom an
assientoto trade in the region for thirty years. In reality the company was unable to undertake
extensive business, though such problems did not permeate back to the UK for quite some
time and, in the interim period, investors were encouraged to purchase large quantities of
shares based on extravagant promises of profit. Consequently, as it was undertaking little
actual business, the South Sea Company became extremely rich on the basis of shareholder
investment.
Following the companyâ€™s agreement to take on a considerable proportion of the UKâ€™s
public debt in 1717, share prices continued to rise so rapidly that people began buying them
merely in order to sell such shares later at a higher price. (This new breed of investors who
traded in shares were called the â€˜stockjobbersâ€™ and were based around the coffee houses of
Exchange Alley.) Shares were also sold to politicians, enabling the company to publicise a
growing list of elite stockholders, further enhancing the legitimacy of its claims of lucrative
trade and, in turn, speculative investment. On 21 January 1720, an announcement was made
that the company would take over the entire national debt, taking on annuities of around
Â£30 million. (Given the current global financial crisis in 2010, it is worth noting the creative
solution that the government sought to use in the 1700s - using the South Sea Company as a
means of reducing the cost of servicing the public debt by converting government annuities
into lower-yielding shares.)

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
The â€˜South Sea bubbleâ€™ was, in essence, the first speculative bubble that the UK had
experienced. However, by late 1720 this bubble had â€˜burstâ€™ resulting in the companyâ€™s share
price falling from around Â£1,000 to less than Â£100. Inevitably, this burst led to widespread
bankruptcies and, more importantly, impacted directly on members of the government and
political classes of the country which, in turn, led to calls for greater control and regulation of
companies and their directors. The estates of the companyâ€™s directors were confiscated and
used to offset some of the losses suffered by investors while the South Sea Companyâ€™s stock
was divided between the Bank of England and the East India Company; in essence, the government nationalised the company in order to protect the financial system.
The prohibition on establishing joint-stock companies with a Royal Charter set down in
the Bubble Act (also known as the Royal Exchange and London Assurance Corporation Act
1719), remained in force until 1825. By this stage the Industrial Revolution had gathered
momentum and, with it, a growing sense that the time was right for legal change to be effected
in order to facilitate business activity. Restrictions were gradually lifted on ordinary people
being permitted to incorporate businesses. However, little success was enjoyed until 1843
when William Gladstone took chairmanship of a Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock
Companies; the resultant piece of legislation being the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844.
The Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 first introduced the possibility of incorporation of
companies via registration. Due to the fact that the concept of â€˜limited liabilityâ€™ remained
rather a contentious issue that ran contrary to the established business practice of the time
(i.e. that an individual - e.g. merchant, trader, etc. - should be personally liable for debts
incurred in the course of his/her business), the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 imposed
a form of direct and unlimited liability for debts (Re Sea Fire and Life Assurance Co,
Greenwoodâ€™s Case (1854) 3 De G M & G 459).
However, the debate as to whether limited liability ran contrary to accepted business practice designed to maintain certain standards of behaviour in society or that many members in
such joint-stock companies were simply passive investors who sought no active involvement
in the day-to-day running of the business (and as such should not be held accountable for any
resultant debts accrued) continued, fuelled by the needs of the Industrial Revolution. The
growing sense was that in order to attract capital from private investors into the hands of
industrialists and/or entrepreneurs, and as such fuel the growing economy, a certain level of
protection needed to be provided to these people. The Limited Liability Act 1855 marked the
pivotal moment in this debate, allowing any registered company with at least 25 members to
limit the liability of its members to the amounts unpaid on their shares. However, as a warning to those external to the company seeking to undertake business with it, such companies
were required to place â€˜limitedâ€™ as the last word of its name.
The Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 subsequently reduced the minimum number of
members to seven. The Act also provided for the fact that the liability of members of a
registered company should only be to the company and not directly to the creditors of the
company. However, the 1856 Act is significant in terms of bringing together the concepts of
a simple registration process coupled with limited liability in the form of the worldâ€™s first
modern company law legislation. All subsequent Companies Acts, even the Companies Act
2006, have sought to retain these same fundamental principles.
It is worth noting that while this new concept of limited liability encouraged private
investors to invest capital into companies in which they would not undertake any active
management roles, the legislation did not specify that such companies were expected to have
investors who did not take part in the day-to-day running of the company. As such, the

opportunity for groups of investors, who were also the managers of the company, to adopt
the limited liability format began to be increasingly pursued by the late 1800s. This, in turn,
gave rise to the growth of quasi-partnership companies (discussed in greater depth within
Chapters 4 and 5) as well as one of the leading cases in Company Law - Salomonv Salomon
& Co Ltd[1897] AC 22.
The growth of the corporate form and its subsequent dominance as the preferred organisational form have led to ongoing concerns regarding the accountability of managers to shareholders and attempts to reform this area of the law, even up to the present day. For example,
following the Great Depression the Companies Act 1948 sought to provide greater â€˜shareholder
democracyâ€™ within companies by ensuring that a number of member-authorisations were
introduced alongside the ability of shareholders to remove directors via a simple majority
vote. However, such procedures have come at the expense of time and money in compliance
with such procedures. The UK governmentâ€™s Bullock Report published in 1977 proposed
further reform in the shape of allowing employees to participate in the selection process
for a companyâ€™s board of directors, as exemplified by the German Codetermination Act 1976.
Under this system there is a two-tier management structure (consisting of a managerial/
executive board and a supervisory board), the former being responsible for the day-today management of the company and the latter overseeing the executive board - and having
the power of appointment and removal of its personnel. (In most German public companies
around one-third of the supervisory boardâ€™s membership is elected by the employees of
the company, with the remaining two-thirds being appointed by the shareholders.) However, the UK never implemented these reforms, driven in part by the UKâ€™s limited concern for the interests of employees. (It should be noted that the Draft Fifth EU Directive on
Company Law would have introduced this two-tier model for all public companies of EU
member states. However, this proposal was resisted by a number of governments, with the
introduction of the Societas Europaea being the compromise position. See: Regulation (EC)
2157/2001.)
The Cork Report subsequently sought to curtail the actions of directors who negligently
ran companies at a loss, resulting in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986. More recently, the focus of reform has been upon internal control
mechanisms (e.g. auditing processes, remuneration committees, etc.).
Classification of corporations - the company as
a corporation
The main classification is between corporations sole and aggregate.
Corporation sole
A corporation may be a corporation sole (i.e. it may consist of only one member at a time
holding a perpetual office). Here the office is personified to distinguish it from the person
who is from time to time the holder of it.
The concept has little commercial application but a useful and practical example is provided by the Public Trustee which is a corporation sole created by the Public Trustee Act
1906. The Public Trustee is a civil servant who, while in post, is the sole member of the

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
corporation. The corporation is trustee of much property and it would be inconvenient if all
the trusts had to be transferred into the ownership of the new holder of the office every time
there was a change. The office of Public Trustee, therefore, was personified as a corporation
sole and the trust property is vested in the corporation and is not affected when the human
holder of the office changes.
The role of Public Trustee has now been assumed by the Official Solicitor and the Public
Trust Office no longer exists. The posts of Official Solicitor and Public Trustee are held by the
same person, although some types of work can only be accepted by that person in the role of
Public Trustee, and other types of work only in the role of Official Solicitor. The Office of the
Official Solicitor and Public Trustee handles relevant business.
Corporation aggregate
A corporation aggregate consists of a number of persons so associated that in law they form
a single person, e.g. a registered company. Here the undertaking is personified so that it may
be distinguished from its members. A registered company is, like any other corporation, an
entity separate from its members as the following cases illustrate.
Salomonv Salomon & Co Ltd[1897] AC 22
Salomon carried on business as a leather merchant and boot manufacturer. In 1892 he formed a
limited company to take over the business. The memorandum of association was signed by
Salomon, his wife, his daughter, and four of his sons. Each subscribed for one share. The subscribers met and appointed Mr Salomon and his two elder sons as directors. The company paid
Â£39,000 to Salomon for the business, and the mode of payment was to give Salomon Â£10,000 in
debentures, secured by a floating charge on the companyâ€™s assets, and 20,000 shares of Â£1 each
and the balance in cash. Less than one year later the company fell on hard times and a liquidator
was appointed. If Salomonâ€™s debenture was valid, he was, as a secured creditor, entitled to be paid
before the unsecured trade creditors. The assets were sufficient to pay off the debentures but
in that event the trade creditors would receive nothing. The unsecured creditors claimed all the
remaining assets on the ground that the company was a mere alias or agent for Salomon.
Held- A company is, at law, a distinct and separate person from the people who set the company
up. Once an association has incorporated, the company is an independent entity, separate from
those who had set it up. Any fully paid-up shareholders could not be required to pay any more.
The debentures were perfectly valid, and Salomon was entitled to the remaining assets in payment
of the secured debentures held by him. Lord MacNaughten stated:
When the trial came on before Vaughan Williams J., the validity of Mr Broderipâ€™s claim was admitted,
and it was not disputed that the 20,000 shares were fully paid up. The case presented by the
liquidator broke down completely; but the learned judge suggested that the company had a right of
indemnity against Mr Salomon. The signatories of the memorandum of association were, he said,
mere nominees of Mr Salomon - mere dummies. The company was Mr Salomon in another form. He
used the name of the company as an alias. He employed the company as his agent; so the company,
he thought, was entitled to indemnity against its principal. The counter-claim was accordingly
amended to raise this point; and on the amendment being made the learned judge pronounced an
order in accordance with the view he had expressed.
The order of the learned judge appears to me to be founded on a misconception of the scope and
effect of the Companies Act 1862. In order to form a company limited by shares, the Act requires that
a memorandum of association should be signed by seven persons, who are each to take one share

Classification of corporations - the company as a corporation
at least. If those conditions are complied with, what can it matter whether the signatories are relations
or strangers? There is nothing in the Act requiring that the subscribers to the memorandum should
be independent or unconnected, or that they or any one of them should take a substantial interest in
the undertaking, or that they should have a mind and will of their own, as one of the learned Lords
Justices seems to think, or that there should be anything like a balance of power in the constitution
of the company. In almost every company that is formed the statutory number is eked out by clerks
or friends, who sign their names at the request of the promoter or promoters without intending to take
any further part or interest in the matter.
When the memorandum is duly signed and registered, though there be only seven shares taken,
the subscribers are a body corporate â€˜capable forthwithâ€™, to use the words of the enactment, â€˜of exercising all the functions of an incorporated companyâ€™. Those are strong words. The company attains
maturity on its birth. There is no period of minority - no interval of incapacity. I cannot understand how
a body corporate thus made â€˜capableâ€™ by statute can lose its individuality by issuing the bulk of its
capital to one person, whether he be a subscriber to the memorandum or not. The company is at law
a different person altogether from the subscribers to the memorandum; and, though it may be that
after incorporation the business is precisely the same as it was before, and the same persons are
managers, and the same hands receive the profits, the company is not in law the agent of the subscribers or trustee for them. Nor are the subscribers as members liable, in any shape or form, except
to the extent and in the manner provided by the Act. That is, I think, the declared intention of the
enactment. If the view of the learned judge were sound, it would follow that no common law partnership could register as a company limited by shares without remaining subject to unlimited liability.
Mr Salomon appealed; but his appeal was dismissed with costs, though the Appellate Court did
not entirely accept the view of the Court below. The decision of the Court of Appeal proceeds on a
declaration of opinion embodied in the order which has been already read.
I must say that I, too, have great difficulty in understanding this declaration. If it only means that
Mr. Salomon availed himself to the full of the advantages offered by the Act of 1862, what is there
wrong in that?...
It has become the fashion to call companies of this class â€˜one man companiesâ€™. That is a taking
nickname, but it does not help one much in the way of argument. If it is intended to convey the meaning that a company which is under the absolute control of one person is not a company legally incorporated, although the requirements of the Act of 1862 may have been complied with, it is inaccurate
and misleading: if it merely means that there is a predominant partner possessing an overwhelming
influence and entitled practically to the whole of the profits, there is nothing in that that I can see contrary to the true intention of the Act of 1862, or against public policy, or detrimental to the interests of
creditors. If the shares are fully paid up, it cannot matter whether they are in the hands of one or many.
If the shares are not fully paid, it is as easy to gauge the solvency of an individual as to estimate the
financial ability of a crowd. One argument was addressed to your Lordships which ought perhaps to
be noticed, although it was not the ground of decision in either of the Courts below. It was argued
that the agreement for the transfer of the business to the company ought to be set aside, because
there was no independent board of directors, and the property was transferred at an overvalue. There
are, it seems to me, two answers to that argument. In the first place, the directors did just what they
were authorised to do by the memorandum of association. There was no fraud or misrepresentation,
and there was nobody deceived. In the second place, the company have put it out of their power to
restore the property which was transferred to them. It was said that the assets were sold by an order
made in the presence of Mr Salomon, though not with his consent, which declared that the sale was
to be without prejudice to the rights claimed by the company by their counter-claim. I cannot see what
difference that makes. The reservation in the order seems to me to be simply nugatory.
I am of opinion that the appeal ought to be allowed, and the counter-claim of the company dismissed with costs, both here and below.
Furthermore, Lord Halsbury stated:
My Lords, the important question in this case, I am not certain it is not the only question, is whether
the respondent company was a company at all - whether in truth that artificial creation of the

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Legislature had been validly constituted in this instance; and in order to determine that question it is
necessary to look at what the statute itself has determined in that respect. I have no right to add to
the requirements of the statute, nor to take from the requirements thus enacted. The sole guide must
be the statute itself.
Now, that there were seven actual living persons who held shares in the company has not been
doubted. As to the proportionate amounts held by each I will deal presently; but it is important to
observe that this first condition of the statute is satisfied, and it follows as a consequence that it would
not be competent to any one - and certainly not to these persons themselves - to deny that they were
shareholders.
I must pause here to point out that the statute enacts nothing as to the extent or degree of interest
which may be held by each of the seven, or as to the proportion of interest or influence possessed
by one or the majority of the shareholders over the others. One share is enough. Still less is it possible
to contend that the motive of becoming shareholders or of making them shareholders is a field
of inquiry which the statute itself recognises as legitimate. If they are shareholders, they are shareholders for all purposes; and even if the statute was silent as to the recognition of trusts, I should be
prepared to hold that if six of them were the cestuis que trust of the seventh, whatever might be
their rights inter se, the statute would have made them shareholders to all intents and purposes
with their respective rights and liabilities, and, dealing with them in their relation to the company, the
only relations which I believe the law would sanction would be that they were corporators of the
corporate body.
I am simply here dealing with the provisions of the statute, and it seems to me to be essential to
the artificial creation that the law should recognise only that artificial existence - quite apart from the
motives or conduct of individual corporators. In saying this, I do not at all mean to suggest that if it
could be established that this provision of the statute to which I am adverting had not been complied
with, you could not go behind the certificate of incorporation to show that a fraud had been committed upon the officer entrusted with the duty of giving the certificate, and that by some proceeding
in the nature of scire faciasyou could not prove the fact that the company had no real legal existence.
But short of such proof it seems to me impossible to dispute that once the company is legally incorporated it must be treated like any other independent person with its rights and liabilities appropriate
to itself, and that the motives of those who took part in the promotion of the company are absolutely
irrelevant in discussing what those rights and liabilities are.
I will for the sake of argument assume the proposition that the Court of Appeal lays down - that
the formation of the company was a mere scheme to enable Aron Salomon to carry on business in
the name of the company . I am wholly unable to follow the proposition that this was contrary to the
true intent and meaning of the Companies Act. I can only find the true intent and meaning of the Act
from the Act itself; and the Act appears to me to give a company a legal existence with, as I have said,
rights and liabilities of its own, whatever may have been the ideas or schemes of those who brought
it into existence.
I observe that the learned judge (Vaughan Williams J) held that the business was Mr Salomonâ€™s
business, and no one elseâ€™s, and that he chose to employ as agent a limited company; and he proceeded to argue that he was employing that limited company as agent, and that he was bound to
indemnify that agent (the company). I confess it seems to me that that very learned judge becomes
involved by this argument in a very singular contradiction. Either the limited company was a legal
entity or it was not. If it was, the business belonged to it and not to Mr Salomon. If it was not, there
was no person and no thing to be an agent at all; and it is impossible to say at the same time that
there is a company and there is not.
(i) There was no fraud upon creditors or shareholders. The creditors of the old business had been
paid off. The unsecured creditors concerned in this case were creditors of the new company. The
House of Lords took the view that they must be deemed to know the risk they were taking if the
company went into liquidation with insufficient funds. The members who had fully paid shares
could not be required to pay more. Any profit which Mr Salomon might have made as a promoter

Classification of corporations - the company as a corporation
selling his business to the company, and in fact the price of some of the assets was fixed prior
to sale at figures exceeding their balance sheet value by some Â£8,000, was fully disclosed and
approved by the shareholders, i.e. his family.
(ii) The decision in Salomonwas of vital importance at the time. Shortly after the industrial revolution, commerce and capitalism were on the increase and this decision encouraged individuals to
provide money for businesses, without the threat of liability if the company became insolvent. This
in turn increased the countryâ€™s economic prosperity as more people were willing to take risks with
their money within the safety buffer of limited liability.
Judicial pronouncement has also been firm in support of the principle that if people choose
to conduct their affairs through the medium of corporations, they are taking advantage of the
fact that in law those corporations are separate legal entities, whose property and actions are
in law not the property or actions of their incorporators or shareholders.
Macaurav Northern Assurance Co Ltd[1925] AC 619
Macaura was the owner of a timber estate in County Tyrone and he formed an estate company
and sold the timber to it for Â£42,000. The purchase money was paid by the issue to Macaura and
his nominees of 42,000 fully paid shares of Â£1 each. No other shares were issued. He also financed
the company and was an unsecured creditor for Â£19,000, its other debts being trifling. Macaura
effected an insurance policy on the timber in his own name, and not in that of the company or as
agent for the company, and on 23 February 1922 most of the timber was destroyed by fire.
Macaura claimed under his policies, but he was held not to have an insurable interest. He could
only be insuring either as a creditor or as a shareholder of the company, and neither a simple creditor nor a shareholder has an insurable interest in a particular asset which the company holds,
since the company is an independent entity. Lord Sumner stated:
My Lords, this appeal relates to an insurance on goods against loss by fire. It is clear that the appellant had no insurable interest in the timber described. It was not his. It belonged to the Irish Canadian
Sawmills Ltd, of Skibbereen, Co Cork. He had no lien or security over it and, though it lay on his land
by his permission, he had no responsibility to its owner for its safety, nor was it there under any contract that enabled him to hold it for his debt. He owned almost all the shares in the company, and the
company owed him a good deal of money, but, neither as creditor nor as shareholder, could he insure
the companyâ€™s assets. The debt was not exposed to fire nor were the shares, and the fact that he was
virtually the companyâ€™s only creditor, while the timber was its only asset, seems to me to make no
difference. He stood in no â€˜legal or equitable relation toâ€™ the timber at all. He had no â€˜concern inâ€™ the
subject insured. His relation was to the company, not to its goods, and after the fire he was directly
prejudiced by the paucity of the companyâ€™s assets, not by the fire...
Lord Wrenbury also noted:
My Lords, this appeal may be disposed of by saying that the corporator even if he holds all the shares
is not the corporation, and that neither he nor any creditor of the company has any property legal or
equitable in the assets of the corporation.
Unlike a shareholder, a debenture holder can insure the property of the company on which his
debenture is secured (Westminster Fire Office v Glasgow Provident Investment Society (1888)
13 App Cas 699). The difference in the debenture holderâ€™s position is justifiable since as a secured
creditor he has an interest by way of a charge on the companyâ€™s property which, of course, the
shareholder does not have.

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Lee (Catherine)v Leeâ€™s Air Farming Ltd[1960] 3 All ER 420
In 1954 the appellantâ€™s husband formed the respondent company which carried on the business
of crop spraying from the air. In March 1956, Mr Lee was killed while piloting an aircraft during
the course of top-soil dressing, and Mrs Lee claimed compensation from the company, as the
employer of her husband, under the New Zealand Workersâ€™ Compensation Act 1922. Since Mr Lee
owned 2,999 of the companyâ€™s 3,000 Â£1 shares and since he was its governing director, the question arose as to whether the relationship of employer and employee could exist between the company and him. One of his first acts as governing director had been to appoint himself the only pilot
of the company at a salary arranged by himself. The judgment of their Lordships was delivered by
Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest, who stated:
The Court of Appeal recognised that a director of a company may properly enter into a service agreement with his company, but they considered that, in the present case, inasmuch as the deceased was
the governing director in whom was vested the full government and control of the company he could
not also be a servant of the company. After referring in his judgment to the delegation to the deceased
of substantially all the powers of the company, North J said: â€˜These powers were moreover delegated
to him for life and there remained with the company no power of management whatsoever. One of his
first acts was to appoint himself the only pilot of the company, for, although article 33 foreshadowed
this appointment, a contract could only spring into existence after the company had been incorporated. Therefore, he became in effect both employer and worker. True, the contract of employment
was between himself and the company...but on him lay the duty both of giving orders and obeying
them. In our view, the two offices are clearly incompatible. There could exist no power of control and
therefore the relationship of master-servant was not created.â€™
The substantial question which arises is, as their Lordships think, whether the deceased was a
â€˜workerâ€™ within the meaning of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, 1922, and its amendments. Was he
a person who had entered into or worked under a contract of service with an employer? The Court of
Appeal thought that his special position as governing director precluded him from being a servant of
the company. On this view it is difficult to know what his status and position was when he was performing the arduous and skilful duties of piloting an aeroplane which belonged to the company and
when he was carrying out the operation of top-dressing farm lands from the air. He was paid wages
for so doing. The company kept a wages book in which these were recorded. The work that was being
done was being done at the request of farmers whose contractual rights and obligations were with
the company alone. It can not be suggested that when engaged in the activities above referred to the
deceased was discharging his duties as governing director. Their Lordships find it impossible to resist
the conclusion that the active aerial operations were performed because the deceased was in some
contractual relationship with the company. That relationship came about because the deceased as
one legal person was willing to work for and to make a contract with the company which was another
legal entity. A contractual relationship could only exist on the basis that there was consensus between
two contracting parties. It was never suggested (nor in their Lordshipsâ€™ view could it reasonably have
been suggested) that the company was a sham or a mere simulacrum. It is well established that the
mere fact that someone is a director of a company is no impediment to his entering into a contract to
serve the company. If, then, it be accepted that the respondent company was a legal entity their
Lordships see no reason to challenge the validity of any contractual obligations which were created
between the company and the deceased...
Nor in their Lordshipsâ€™ view were any contractual obligations invalidated by the circumstance that
the deceased was sole governing director in whom was vested the full government and control of the
company. Always assuming that the company was not a sham then the capacity of the company to
make a contract with the deceased could not be impugned merely because the deceased was the
agent of the company in its negotiation. The deceased might have made a firm contract to serve the
company for a fixed period of years. If within such period he had retired from the office of governing
director and other directors had been appointed his contract would not have been affected. The
circumstance that in his capacity as a shareholder he could control the course of events would not in

Classification of corporations - the company as a corporation
itself affect the validity of his contractual relationship with the company. When, therefore, it is said that
â€˜one of his first acts was to appoint himself the only pilot of the companyâ€™, it must be recognised that
the appointment was made by the company, and that it was none the less a valid appointment
because it was the deceased himself who acted as the agent of the company in arranging it. In their
Lordshipsâ€™ view it is a logical consequence of the decision in Salomonâ€™scase that one person may
function in dual capacities. There is no reason, therefore, to deny the possibility of a contractual
relationship being created as between the deceased and the company. If this stage is reached then
their lordships see no reason why the range of possible contractual relationships should not include
a contract for services, and if the deceased as agent for the company could negotiate a contract for
services as between the company and himself there is no reason why a contract of service could not
also be negotiated. It is said that therein lies the difficulty, because it is said that the deceased could
not both be under the duty of giving orders and also be under the duty of obeying them. But this
approach does not give effect to the circumstance that it would be the company and not the
deceased that would be giving the orders. Control would remain with the company whoever might be
the agent of the company to exercise it. The fact that so long as the deceased continued to be governing director, with amplitude of powers, it would be for him to act as the agent of the company to
give the orders, does not alter the fact that the company and the deceased were two separate and
distinct legal persons. If the deceased had a contract of service with the company then the company
had a right of control. The manner of its exercise would not affect or diminish the right to its exercise.
But the existence of a right to control cannot be denied if once the reality of the legal existence of the
company is recognised. Just as the company and the deceased were separate legal entities so as to
permit of contractual relations being established between them, so also were they separate legal
entities so as to enable the company to give an order to the deceased...
Ex faciethere was a contract of service. Their Lordships conclude, therefore, that the real issue in
the case is whether the position of the deceased as sole governing director made it impossible for
him to be the servant of the company in the capacity of chief pilot of the company. In their Lordshipsâ€™
view, for the reasons which have been indicated, there was no such impossibility. There appears to
be no greater difficulty in holding that a man acting in one capacity can give orders to himself in
another capacity than there is in holding that a man acting in one capacity can make a contract with
himself in another capacity. The company and the deceased were separate legal entities. The company had the right to decide what contracts for aerial top-dressing it would enter into. The deceased
was the agent of the company in making the necessary decisions. Any profits earned would belong
to the company and not to the deceased. If the company entered into a contract with a farmer, then
it lay within its right and power to direct its chief pilot to perform certain operations. The right to control existed even though it would be for the deceased in his capacity as agent for the company to
decide what orders to give. The right to control existed in the company, and an application of the principles of Salomonâ€™scase demonstrates that the company was distinct from the deceased. As pointed
out above, there might have come a time when the deceased would remain bound contractually to
serve the company as chief pilot though he had retired from the office of sole governing director. Their
Lordships consider, therefore, that the deceased was a worker and that the question posed in the
case stated should be answered in the affirmative.
Held- Mrs Lee was entitled to compensation because her husband was employed by the company in the sense required by the Act of 1922, and the decision in Salomon v Salomon & Co
was applied.
(i) In AGâ€™s Reference (No 2 of 1982)[1984] 2 All ER 216 the Court of Appeal held that two directors who were also shareholders of several companies were capable of stealing from those
companies. Money from the companies, which had raised large loans from various institutions,
had been used, it was alleged, to support the extravagant lifestyle of the directors and their wives.
There had, it was alleged, been a spending of the companyâ€™s money in hotels and restaurants
and on cars, yachts, and house improvements, silver and antiques. The effect on creditors was

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
obviously uppermost in the mind of the court, which felt that a criminal sanction was needed.
By applying the rule of corporate personality the directors could, as a matter of law, be liable for
stealing from a company which they owned.
(ii) This case has been distinguished in employment/insolvency law. When a company becomes
insolvent, directors, who are regarded for many purposes as employees, i.e. the executive directors such as the finance director, are preferential creditors for salary due up to defined limits. These
will be discussed in later chapters on company charges and insolvency. If the insolvent company
cannot meet these payments, there may be a claim through the governmentâ€™s Business, Enterprise
& Regulatory Reform Department (BERR), which in turn will try to recoup any payments made
from the company. However, where the director concerned is also a controlling shareholder, the
Employment Appeal Tribunal has refused to support claims on the BERR. Leeâ€™s case has been distinguished because claims on the BERR are met from public funds whereas in Leeâ€™s case the funds
were supplied by the companyâ€™s insurers (see Buchanv Secretary of State for Trade and Employment
(1997) 565 IRLB 2). The tribunal approach is based upon the fact that the definition of an employee
still requires an element of employer control which is not present where the worker in effect controls himself. However, in Flemingv Secretary of State for Trade and Industry(1998) 588 IRLB
10 the Scottish Court of Session rejected the view expressed in Buchan that a controlling shareholder/director could never as a matter of law be an employee. However, the directorâ€™s claim in
Fleming was turned down on the facts. He worked alongside the employees but was a majority
shareholder and had guaranteed the companyâ€™s debts. The Flemingapproach was also approved
by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in Secretary of State for Trade and Industryv Bottrill[1998]
IRLR 120 where Morison J said that the reasoning in Buchan was â€˜unsoundâ€™. The decision of the
EAT was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for Trade and Industryv Bottrill(1999)
615 IRLB 12. In Connollyv Sellers Arenascene Ltd(2000) 633 IRLB 15 the EAT ruled that the controlling shareholder of a company could be an employee. He had a contract of employment with the
company. The contract was not a sham and he had been treated and rewarded as an employee.
It seems then from the case law that a director/controlling shareholder will be regarded as an
employee where there is a written contract of employment and all the usual hallmarks of employment are present. Certainly the original, almost blanket, ban on controlling shareholder/directors
as employees has been much eroded.
(iii) The courts continue to be willing to draw aside the corporate veil where the circumstances warrant it. Thus, in Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Backhouse (2001) The Times, 23
February, Mr Backhouse was ordered to pay the costs of the Secretary of State in connection with
a winding-up petition presented by him against North West Holdings plc, a company controlled by
Mr Backhouse. It appeared that Mr Backhouse had caused the company to defend the petition not
in the interests of the company but in order to protect his own personal reputation. His personal
business affairs were bound up with those of the company and money the company earned had
been treated as if it belonged to Mr Backhouse. The court drew aside the corporate veil so as to
make the companyâ€™s liability to pay costs that of Mr Backhouse personally. The court would obviously bear in mind that if the company was required to pay the costs, they would in effect be paid
by the companyâ€™s creditors who would be denied access to the funds required to pay them.
Again, in Trustor AB v Smallbone (2001) The Times, 30 March, Mr Smallbone, a director of
Trustor AB, opened a bank account in London for the company and without the approval of the
board paid money belonging to Trustor AB from its account in Sweden to the London account.
Mr Smallbone then paid Â£38 million from Trustor ABâ€™s account in London to the account of a company called Introcom (International) Ltd that he controlled. When this was discovered by the members of the board of Trustor AB, they caused the company to claim the funds back from Introcom
and also claimed that Mr Smallbone should be regarded as having received the money personally
so that he was liable to repay the money personally if Introcom did not. The High Court ruled that
the corporate veil could be drawn aside in this case to make Mr Smallbone personally liable.

Classification of registered companies
On the other hand, the Court of Appeal refused to draw aside the veil in Ordv Belhaven Pubs
Ltd[1998] 2 BCLC 447. The Ords purchased a 20-year lease of a pub, the Fox Inn. Belhaven Pubs
Ltd owned the freehold and was the landlord. The Ords later alleged misrepresentation by
Belhaven as to the turnover and profitability of the Fox Inn. They wished to make a claim. However,
the holding company of the group in which Belhaven was a subsidiary carried out a reconstruction
of the group, leaving Belhaven with only the Fox Inn as an asset. Belhaven ceased trading. The
Ords wanted to claim against Ascot Holdings as the true owner (they said) of the Belhaven business. The Court of Appeal refused to draw aside the Belhaven veil and the Ords were unable to
make Ascot a defendant. The reconstruction was genuine, ruled the Court of Appeal. There was
no justification for ignoring the Salomon principle.
As a separate legal entity, the courts to a very large degree will allow companies to operate as
âž¨ See p. 94 they see fit within the boundaries of the law. (This will be explored further in Chapter 4 âž¨.)
The courts are very protective of the Salomondecision and the corporate form. Without it,
company law would virtually collapse as limited liability would no longer act as an incentive
for investors to be able to restrict the risks associated with their â€˜passiveâ€™ investment; the consequence being the grinding to a halt of the corporate-capitalist machine.
However, on some occasions the courts and the legislature have found it necessary to
lift the corporate veil, or to remove the protection (in the form of limited liability) that is
afforded shareholders. This means that the courts or statutes will lift the veil of incorporation
to reveal the people who stand behind the company. They will look to make those people
responsible for the actions of the company. This will be examined further later in this chapter.
However, it is worth reading some of the academic opinion in the area. (See Ottolenghi
(1990) â€˜From Peeping behind the Corporate Veil, to Ignoring It Completelyâ€™, 53 MLR 338.

Classification of registered companies
Public companies
Section 4 defines a public company as a company limited by shares or by guarantee with a
share capital whose certificate of incorporation states that the company is a public company.
The name of a public company must end with the words â€˜public limited companyâ€™, or the
Welsh equivalent if the registered office is situated in Wales. The abbreviation plc may be used
and the equivalent in Welsh may be given where the registered office is to be in Wales.
If the company is to be a public company, the minimum capital must be at least Â£50,000,
or such other sum as the Secretary of State, in the future by statutory instrument, specifies
instead. As we have seen, the certificate of incorporation of a public company states that it is
(a public company) and is conclusive evidence that the Act has been complied with and that
the company is a public company (s 15).
Under s 761 a public company formed as such cannot commence business or borrow
money unless the Registrar has issued a s 761 certificate, which private companies do not require.
The certificate is issued if the nominal value of the companyâ€™s allotted share capital is at least
Â£50,000 and not less than one-quarter of the nominal value of each issued share and the whole
of any premium has been received by the company whether in cash or otherwise. A share

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
allotted under an employeesâ€™ share scheme cannot be taken into account in determining the
companyâ€™s allotted share capital unless it is paid up as to one-quarter of the nominal value
and the whole of any premium on the share.
In order to show the extent to which the companyâ€™s starting capital might be watered
down, the obtaining of a s 761 certificate requires disclosure to the Registrar of the amount of
preliminary expenses (including the cost of allotting shares) and by whom these were paid or
are payable because if not by the company such persons will normally require reimbursement
and the benefits given or intended to be given to the companyâ€™s promoters.
The s 761 certificate is conclusive evidence that the company is entitled to do business
and exercise any borrowing powers. It is unusual for a company to incorporate as a public
company. It is more common to incorporate as a private company and go public at a later
stage (e.g. when the business has expanded sufficiently to benefit from going to the market so
that the public can subscribe for its shares). This obviates the need for a s 761 certificate in
most cases.
Private companies: generally
These are intended for the smaller business. Chapter 1 of Part 20 of the Companies Act 2006
(ss 755-760) prohibits public offers by private companies. A private purchaser must be found.
The single-member private limited company
Section 7 of the Companies Act 2006 permits the formation of single-member limited liability
companies. It is now no longer necessary to have an â€˜artificialâ€™ member, who exists in many
private companies which in fact have a sole proprietor but where, for example, a spouse holds
a nominee share to fulfil the previous two-member requirement.
The same is true of subsidiaries whether trading or dormant where someone such as
the group secretary or a separate nominee company has in the past had to hold a share or
shares in the subsidiary, normally under a declaration of trust and a blank transfer form in
favour of the parent comp any so that the shareholding can be recalled from the nominee at
A further useful application is that where one shareholder in a two-member company dies,
the remaining shareholder can seek to acquire the deceasedâ€™s shares from the personal representatives and convert the company into a single-member private company.
Gramophone and Typewriter Co Ltdv Stanley[1908] 2 KB 89 (Court of Appeal)
In this case the appellant company (resident in England) held all of the shares in a German company (Deutsche Grammophon Aktiengesellschaft). The appellant had then been assessed, for
income tax purposes, on the monies retained by the German company (and subsequently transferred to a depreciation fund) as well as the actual profits which had been remitted to it in England.
The case was dependent upon whether the unremitted funds were the gains of a business â€˜carried
onâ€™ by the English company as opposed to a separate entity.
Held- the Court of Appeal rejected this view. The fact that all of the shares in a company are held
by one person does not, without additional factors, make the companyâ€™s business the business of
that person. Buckley LJ stated:

Classification of registered companies
The question is, I think, one of fact, and one upon which we are not concluded by any findings of fact
on the part of the Commissioners. The question of fact is whether the business in Germany is carried
on by the appellant company. If it is, the respondents do not dispute that the Attorney-General is right.
If, on the contrary, the German business is not carried on by the English company, then equally the
Attorney-General cannot dispute but that the English company is assessable only upon the dividends
which it may receive upon its shares in the German company.
In order to succeed the Attorney-General must, I think, make out either, first, that the German company is a fiction, a sham, a simulacrum, and that in reality the English company, and not the German
company, is carrying on the business; or, secondly, that the German company, if it is a real thing, is
the agent of the English company. As regards the former of these, there are no facts at all to show
that the German company is a pretence. It was formed in January 1900 by the union of three other
companies, each of which brought in substantial properties, and of two individuals. It is duly constituted and governed according to German law, and there is no ground whatever for saying that it
is other than a real German corporation carrying on business in Germany under circumstances in
which the company and its officers are amenable to German law and with a view to the acquisition of
profit. The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the German company is agent of the English
company, whether the English company is really carrying on the business and is employing the
German company to do so on its behalf. Upon this point the Attorney-General relies principally upon
the fact that, as stated in paragraph 17 of the case, the appellant company now holds all the shares
of the German company. In my opinion this fact does not establish the relation of principal and agent
between the English company and the German company. It is so familiar that it would be waste of
time to dwell upon the difference between the corporation and the aggregate of all the corporators.
But I may point out the following considerations as bearing upon the question whether the possession of all the shares is evidence of agency. Suppose that during the year whose accounts are under
review the appellant company had held no shares at all in the first six months and had held all the
shares in the last six months, or suppose that, having held all the shares but ten today, it became the
holder of all tomorrow and again parted with ten the next day, it cannot seriously be suggested that
each time one person becomes the holder of all the shares an agency comes into existence which
dies again when he parts with some of them.
Further it is urged that the English company, as owning all the shares, can control the German
company in the sense that the German company must do all that the English company directs. In my
opinion this again is a misapprehension. This Court decided not long since, in Automatic SelfCleansing Filter Syndicate Co LdvCunninghame, that even a resolution of a numerical majority at
a general meeting of th e company cannot impose its will upon the directors when the articles have
confided to them the control of the companyâ€™s affairs. The directors are not servants to obey directions given by the shareholders as individuals; they are not agents appointed by and bound to serve
the shareholders as their principals. They are persons who may by the regulations be entrusted with
the control of the business, and if so entrusted they can be dispossessed from that control only
by the statutory majority which can alter the articles. Directors are not, I think, bound to comply with
the directions even of all the corporators acting as individuals. Of course the corporators have it in
their power by proper resolutions, which would generally be special resolutions, to remove directors
who do not act as they desire, but this in no way answers the question here to be considered, which
is whether the corporators are engaged in carrying on the business of the corporation. In my opinion
they are not. To say that they are involves a complete confusion of ideas.
Registration of single-member companies
The documents which are sent to Companies House are the same as those required for multi-
âž¨ See p. 56 member companies which are considered in Chapter 2 âž¨. The necessary amendments to
company legislation are considered below but it should be noted at this stage that a public
single-member company requires two directors and a secretary so such companies can

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
have one member but need three officers (i.e. two directors and a secretary). In a private
single member company the sole member can be the sole director and a secretary is not a
legal requirement. Such companies need only one member and one officer (i.e. the sole
member) though if a secretary was appointed that individual would be regarded as an officer
of the company which would then have one member and two officers (ss 154, 270, 271 and
274 apply).
Conversion to single-member status
There are no re-registration requirements. Conversion is achieved by transferring the
nominee holding to the then sole proprietor. No resolutions of the company are required
and there are no filing requirements at Companies House. Under s 123, when the number of
members falls to one, or if an unlimited company with only one member becomes a limited
company on re-registration, a statement that this is the case must be entered on the Register
of Members at the side of the name and address of the sole member, together with the date
on which this occurred. No special form of words is given but a statement saying â€˜The company became a single-member company on...(date-month-year)â€™ would appear to suffice.
If the membership increases to two or more, then when that happens, a statement that the
company has ceased to have only one member must be entered in the Register of Members
alongside the name and address of the person who was formerly the sole member. The date
when this occurred is also required. A statement saying â€˜The company ceased to be a singlemember company on...(date-month-year)â€™ would suffice. A default fine is imposed on the
company and its officers in default if the relevant statement is not made.
Accounts and audit
The requirements are no different from those applying to other companies.
Meetings of the single-member company
Section 318 provides that notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the articles
(so that no changes in the articles are required) one member present in person or by proxy
shall be a quorum. Section 357 provides that if the sole member takes any decision which
could have been taken in general meeting he shall (unless it is a written resolution) provide
the company with a written record of it and although it would seem desirable for the sole
member to sign it in case of dispute there is no requirement of signature in the regulations.
Section 318 is not a significant change since all the formalities of calling and holding a meeting will have to be gone through. However, s 357 is significant in that it allows the sole member to conduct business informally without notice or formal minutes.
Filing requirements still apply when, for example, the articles are altered informally, and
an annual general meeting must still be held unless the company is a private company. The
Companies Act 2006 does not require a private company to hold an Annual General Meeting
(AGM) nor need it lay its accounts and reports before a general meeting, thus there need not
be any member meetings. However, board meetings and board resolutions are required
although even here the written resolution procedure for directors provided for by Reg 7 of the
Model Articles for private companies may be used.

Classification of registered companies
Single-member companies may conduct business by written resolution. There is no provision in the Companies Act 2006 for a public company to conduct business by written resolution. However, in multi-member companies written resolutions cannot be used to remove a
director or auditor from office. In single-member companies the s 357 procedure would seem
to be available. Removal of a non-member director or the auditor without a meeting and
without receiving representations from them could be achieved in that way, although the regulations are silent on this.
Contracts with a sole member who is also a director
Section 231 provides that the terms of a contract with a sole member/director must either be
set out in a written memorandum or be made the subject of a report to the next available
board meeting and be recorded in the minutes.
This provision does not apply if the contract is in writing or if it is entered into in the
ordinary course of business, as where the company buys raw materials from the sole
member/director.
Death of the sole member: private companies
If a sole member/director of a private company dies, there is no board to approve the transfer of his or her shares under the terms of the will or on intestacy. The company is then in
effect paralysed, being without a board or shareholders. The articles should therefore be
altered so as to allow, for example, the company secretary, if one has been appointed, to
authorise a transfer or allow the personal representatives of the deceased member to appoint
a director if the company has none. The director could then approve the transfer and the business of the company could proceed.
There is also a common law rule that the directors must actively refuse a transfer within a
reasonable time. Under s 771 any power of veto vested in the directors must be exercised
within two months after the lodging of the transfer and after that time the court can compel
âž¨ See p. 243 the registration of the transfer, as is further described in Chapter 12 âž¨. Nevertheless, it is
better that the articles address this matter. In fact, a power of refusal is not given by s 771 and
must be in the articles. A power of refusal is given in the Model Articles in Reg 26(5) -
private limited companies model - and Reg 62 - public limited companies model.
Small and medium-sized companies
Private companies are further subdivided by ss 381-384 (small companies including parent
companies and groups), which introduce the accounting exemptions. They give the benefit of
confidentiality of information but involve the preparation of two sets of accounts - one for
members and one for the Registrar of Companies. These exemptions then draw a distinction
between the reporting requirements in regard to the accounts which small or medium-sized
companies prepare for their members and those which they file with the Registrar of
Companies. They are allowed to file what the Act refers to as â€˜abbreviatedâ€™ and â€˜modifiedâ€™
accounts with the Registrar.
The 2006 Act permits (but does not require) a small company to dispense with the filing
of its directorsâ€™ report and profit and loss account and allows the filing of an abbreviated

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
balance sheet only. Fuller particulars of the exemptions are given below, but the major
result is that members of the public examining these abbreviated accounts at Companies
Registration Office will have no trading information and will know nothing about directorsâ€™
emoluments or the companyâ€™s dividends.
If a small company files accounts made up in accordance with International Accounting
Standards (IAS accounts) or Companies Act accounts that are not abbreviated accounts but
the directors wish to exercise the option of not providing a copy of the directorâ€™s report
and/or profit and loss account, then s 444(5) states that the balance sheet shall include in a
prominent place a statement that the accounts have been delivered in accordance with the
provisions relating to small companies.
Sections 465-467 set out which companies, parent companies and groups qualify as
medium sized. A medium-sized company may modify only its profit and loss account. Apart
from this, full accounts and reports must be filed.
The modifications to the profit and loss account of a medium-sized company are as
â— Instead of showing turnover, cost of sales, gross profit or loss and other operating income
as separate figures they can be combined into one figure under the heading Gross Profit
â— In addition, the analysis of turnover and profit among different classes of business and different markets need not be given in the notes to the profit and loss account.
The reason for this is that the details of turnover profits and markets were sometimes used
to the unreasonable disadvantage of medium-sized companies by their larger competitors. It
should be noted, however, that this requirement is now removed for all companies where, in
the opinion of the directors, the disclosure of such information would seriously prejudice the
companyâ€™s interests and the fact that it has not been disclosed is stated.
In the case of medium-sized companies, a full and unmodified set of accounts must be prepared for members. The full accounts and reports will be sent to the members, though any
member, or the companyâ€™s auditor, is given the right to require the accounts and reports to
be laid before a general meeting of members.
It may be taken as a general view that there is in many cases little benefit in filing abbreviated accounts for medium-sized companies. Unless there are special reasons for not disclosing details of turnover and cost of sales, the cost of preparing such accounts may outweigh the
Summary of abbreviations applicable
The abbreviations in Table 1.1 are applicable where the accounts of small and medium-sized
companies are filed at Companies House.
Financial reporting standard for smaller entities
The Accounting Standards Board (see now the Financial Reporting Council) decided to free
small companies from the burden of complying with many of the accounting standards. By
conforming to the Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities (FRSSE) such companies
are able to ignore other accounting standards. They may choose not to adopt it, in which case
they remain subject to the full range of standards and abstracts.

Small and medium-sized companies: definitions
(a) Small companies
A small company is one which has been within the limits of two of the following thresholds
since incorporation or, if not within the limits at incorporation, then for the current financial
year and the one before:
Turnover Â£5.6 million or less
Balance sheet total (i.e. total assets) Â£2.8 million or less
Employees 50 (average) or less.
(b) Medium-sized companies
A medium-sized company is one which has been within the limits of two of the following
thresholds since incorporation or, if not within the limits at incorporation, then for the current financial year and the one before:
Turnover Â£22.8 million or less
Balance sheet total (i.e. total assets) Â£11.4 million or less
Employees 250 (average) or less.
As regards both small and medium-sized companies, the employee average is to be ascertained on a monthly basis and not a weekly basis as it was initially. The average is derived by
dividing the sum of the number of employees employed under contracts of service in each
month by the number of months in the financial year.
The authority for the above thresholds is the Companies Act 2006: s 382 for small companies and s 465 for medium-sized companies.
Subsequent failure to qualify
If a company ceases to satisfy the exemption requirements for two successive years, it must
file full accounts for the second year.
Exemptions inapplicable: small and medium-sized companies
The exemptions do not apply if the company concerned is or at any time during its financial

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
(a) A public company (whether listed or unlisted).
(b) A banking or insurance company.
(c) An organisation authorised to conduct investment business under the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000. (However, small authorised firms and appointed representatives
whose only regulated activities are mortgage and insurance activities may take the Companies Act 2006 exemption. An appointed representative is a person in a contractual relationship with an authorised person to carry out authorised activities with the principal
having proper control and for whose activities the authorised principal has accepted
responsibility in writing.)
(d) A member of an â€˜ineligible groupâ€™, i.e. a group containing any of the companies in (a) to
(c) above.
A company which has subsidiaries, i.e. it is a holding or parent company, although it
satisfies the definition of a small or medium-sized company, cannot be treated as one unless
the group as a whole is small or medium-sized within the definitions given below. Thus if
the parent company qualifies as a small company but the group is medium-sized, the parent
would only be entitled to the exemptions available to a medium-sized company when preparing individual accounts.
Small and medium-sized groups
This is a further division into small and medium-sized groups of private companies. Normally,
where a company, say A Ltd, is the holding (or parent) company of B Ltd, e.g. because A Ltd
owns more than half of the voting share capital of B Ltd - generally more than half of B Ltdâ€™s
ordinary shares - then A Ltd and B Ltd have to prepare individual accounts. However, A Ltd
has an extra duty which is to prepare group accounts (or consolidated accounts) showing, for
the benefit of outsiders who might invest in or do business with either company, the financial
position of A Ltd and B Ltd together in one set of financial statements.
However, a parent company, such as A Ltd, need not prepare group accounts for a
financial year in relation to which the group headed by that company qualifies as a small or
medium-sized group and is not an ineligible group. This is a further example of the deregulation of private companies running the smaller business.
The qualifying conditions are met by a group which satisfies two or more of the following
thresholds: (a) in the parent companyâ€™s first financial year as a parent company; and (b) in its
second or subsequent financial year as a parent company in that year and the preceding year.
If it fails to satisfy the exemption requirements for two successive years, it must prepare group
accounts in the second year. The thresholds under s 383 (small) and s 465 (medium-sized) are
given in Table 1.2.
A group can choose to meet the gross or net formula for any item; thus, say, turnover
may be gross and balance sheet total net. The net formula is calculated after adjustments
are made in the consolidation of the accounts, e.g. elimination of inter-company balances.
Thus, if B Ltd owes A Ltd Â£20,000, this Â£20,000 will be shown as an asset in A Ltdâ€™s individual balance sheet and as a liability in the individual balance sheet of B Ltd but not at all in
the group balance sheet. The transaction is cancelled out on consolidation because it is of
no interest to outsiders. Where there are extensive inter-company balances, it may be difficult
for the group to meet the gross formula but the exemptions apply if the net formula is complied with.

Classification of registered companies
Small Medium-sized
Aggregate turnover Â£5.6 m (net) or less Â£22.8 m (net) or less
Â£6.72 m (gross) or less Â£27.36 m (gross) or less
Aggregate balance sheet total Â£2.8 m (net) or less Â£11.4 m (net) or less
Â£3.36 m (gross) or less Â£13.68 m (gross) or less
Number of employees 50 (average) or less 250 (average) or less
In the case of a small or medium-sized group, the average number of persons that the company employs can now be calculated on a monthly average basis instead of a weekly average
as before.
Where a parent company is not exempt and, therefore, is required to prepare group
accounts, it is not required to file a profit and loss account with the annual accounts.
However, where a small or medium-sized company is exempt but chooses voluntarily to prepare group accounts, it must file a profit and loss account. It is not able to take advantage of
the exemption because it is not â€˜requiredâ€™ to prepare group accounts.
Exemptions inapplicable
A group is ineligible if any of the companies in it is a plc (listed or unlisted) or a company
carrying on an insurance market activity or an authorised person under the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (though see earlier comment on this point for small groups). A special
auditorsâ€™ report is required for accounts delivered to the Registrar when small and mediumsized companies and groups take advantage of the exemptions referred to above. The purpose
of the report is to say that the company concerned is entitled to them. This report is not
required where the company has taken advantage of the audit exemption referred to below.
Criteria for exemption
Under s 477, the following conditions must apply in respect of the financial year:
â— The company must qualify as a small company though even where it does it need not take
advantage of the exemption and can have an audit.
â— For these companies:
(a) turnover must not be more than Â£5.6 million, and
(b) the balance sheet total (assets) must not be more than Â£2.8 million.
â— The company must not at any time during the financial year have been an ineligible company, for example:
(a) a public company (listed or unlisted);
(b) a parent or a subsidiary undertaking unless a member of a small group (see below) or
where the subsidiary is dormant (s 249A(1A), (1B) and (1C));
(c) a company carrying on an insurance market activity;
(d) an authorised person or appointed representative under the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (subject to exceptions considered above in regard to accounting
exemptions);

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
(e) a trade union special registered body under the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992, s 117(1), which are treated as corporate entities.
Members holding 10 per cent or more of the issued share capital (or any class thereof) may
require the company to have an audit for the financial year by depositing a written notice at
the companyâ€™s registered office not later than one month before the year end.
Audit exemption and small groups
A parent or non-dormant subsidiary company can claim exemption from audit if the group
of which it is a member satisfies all of the following conditions throughout the financial year
into which the period of group membership falls (s 479):
â— the group qualifies as a small group for the purposes of s 479 and is not at the time of
preparing accounts or at any time in the financial year an ineligible group (see above);
â— the groupâ€™s aggregate turnover in that year is not more than Â£5.6 million net (or Â£6.72
million gross);
â— the groupâ€™s aggregate balance sheet total for that year is not more than Â£2.8 million net
(or Â£3.36 million gross).
Effect on dormant companies
Exemption from audit is available to small dormant companies that are not ineligible under
the dormant company provisions (see below) or the audit exemption procedure. Dormant
companies automatically qualify by being dormant and so long as 10 per cent of the members
do not request an audit (s 480).
Disclosure in annual report and accounts
The balance sheet of a company taking advantage of the relevant audit exemptions must
include a statement to the effect that:
â— the company is eligible to claim the exemption;
â— no notice has been deposited at the companyâ€™s registered office by members holding 10 per
cent or more of the issued capital (or a class thereof) requiring that the company shall have
an audit for the financial year; and
â— the directors acknowledge their responsibilities for:
(a) ensuring that the company keeps proper accounting records; and
(b) preparing accounts which give a true and fair view.
The statement must appear on the face of the balance sheet above the signature required by
s 414 (i.e. by a director of the company on behalf of the board). The name of the signatory
must also be stated.
Format of accounts
Even if the accounts are not audited they should comply with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006. The format should follow the relevant regulations as issued by the
Secretary of State.

Classification of registered companies
References to audit in the articles
Companies with articles based on the 1985 version of Table Aare unlikely to have problems
in dispensing with the audit requirement since the 1985 version does not impose an obligation to appoint auditors. Article 130 of Table Ato the 1948 Act does and companies with
that or a similar article should review the contents of their articles to see that they are not
precluded from implementing the audit exemption. Furthermore, Article 127 which requires
that the accounts be sent to members accompanied by an auditorâ€™s report will also require
amendment.
No such problems arise with companies adopting their relevant Model Articles for the
Companies Act 2006.
Dormant companies
When is a company dormant? Under s 480 a company is dormant if:
â— it has been dormant since its formation; or
â— it has been dormant since the end of the previous financial year; and
â— it is a small company; and
â— it is not required to prepare group accounts;
â— during the dormant period there have been no significant accounting transactions that, by
s 386, are required to be entered in the companyâ€™s accounting records.
Transactions that are exempt from the above and do not prevent dormant status are transactions arising from the taking of shares in the company by a subscriber to the memorandum
as a result of an undertaking in the memorandum, a fee to the Registrar of Companies on a
change of name under s 78, a fee to the Registrar on the re-registration of a company under
the Companies Act 2006 (e.g. limited to unlimited), a penalty under s 453 for failure to deliver
accounts, or a fee for the registration of the annual return under Part 24 of the Companies
Ineligible companies
A company cannot be regarded as dormant if it is ineligible in terms already considered for
audit and accounting exemptions. However, a public company can qualify as a dormant company if it meets the basic s 249AA requirements and is a small company but cannot prepare
small company accounts because of its public company status (see s 249AA(2)(a)) or because
it is a member of an ineligible group. This means that free-standing public limited companies
may have dormant status. If they are members of an ineligible group because the group contains one or more plcs, they may become dormant only if they are subsidiaries. Parent companies cannot be dormant because no company can be dormant under the general definition
(see above) if it is required to prepare group accounts. Examples of transactions which could
prevent dormant status are as follows:
â— bank charges even where the account is inactive;
â— payment of audit fee for the audit of the last period during which the company traded.
The problem can be solved by, say, a holding company or an individual paying the relevant

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Loss of exemption
The directors, or failing them the members, must appoint auditors if the company ceases to
be dormant or otherwise becomes ineligible. Details of the method of appointment appear in
s 388A, which should be referred to.
Form of dormant accounts
The accounts must include:
â— A profit and loss account but only if the company traded in the previous period, the comparative figures being put in.
â— A directorsâ€™ report to include a statement that the company has not traded during the
financial year. It should also state, if relevant, that a profit and loss account has not been
prepared for the year.
â— In place of the previous requirement on directors to make a statement on the balance
sheet that the company has been dormant throughout the year, they must now make the
following statements which bring them into line with the requirements on other trading
audit exempt companies:
1 For the year ended...the company was entitled to exemption under s 480 of the Companies Act 2006.
2 Members have not required the company to obtain an audit of its accounts for the year
in question in accordance with s 476.
3 The directors acknowledge their responsibility for:
(a) ensuring that the company keeps accounting records which comply with s 386; and
(b) preparing accounts which give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the
company as at the end of its financial year in accordance.
Standard format for accounts
Provided the company has been dormant since it was incorporated, it may use Companies
House Form DCA to file its accounts. The form which is available free is only suitable for
dormant companies where the only transaction has been the issue of subscribersâ€™ shares and
the company is not a subsidiary.
A dormant company can file abbreviated accounts in which case there is no need to file the
directorsâ€™ report or the comparative profit and loss account if applicable.
Articles of association
The companyâ€™s articles should be referred to. Articles 127 and 130 of Table A to the Companies Act 1948 require the appointment of auditors unless altered by special (or written)
resolution. There is no similar provision in Table A to the Companies Act 1985 or in the
Companies Act 2006 Model Articles.
Provisions of company law applicable to dormant companies
These are as follows:

Classification of registered companies
(a) rights to receive or demand copies of accounts and reports under ss 423 and 431 continue
but there is obviously no need for an auditorsâ€™ report if there is no audit;
(b) it is not necessary to lay or circulate a copy of the auditorsâ€™ report if there is one nor
deliver a copy to the Registrar.
Dormant companies: agency arrangements
It is common in a wide variety of businesses to operate under agency arrangements where
the agent company has no economic interest in the transactions but merely brings together
the principal company and the third party into a contractual arrangement. Where the agency
is disclosed to the third party, no entries need to be made in the agent companyâ€™s accounting
records and it may submit dormant company accounts. If the agency is not disclosed, the
agent company should record the transactions in its records and, therefore, cannot submit
dormant company accounts. Where the agency is disclosed, the agent company will have to
submit memorandum accounts to the principal and will therefore need to record transactions
but this does not give rise to entries in its own records and so it can be regarded as dormant.
Dormant companies that act as agents must disclose this in their annual accounts. This
applies also to the abbreviated accounts.
Distinctions between a public and a private company
(a) As we have seen, a private company need have only one director and need not have a secretary; a public company must have at least two directors and a secretary. The secretary
of a private company, if one is appointed, need not be qualified in the terms required of
a secretary of a public company (see s 273).
(b) In a private company two or more directors may be appointed by a single resolution.
In a public limited company they must be voted on as individuals (see s 160).
(c) As regards registration. The name of a public company must include â€˜public limited
companyâ€™ or â€˜plcâ€™. A private limited companyâ€™s name must only include â€˜limitedâ€™ or â€˜Ltdâ€™.
Furthermore, a public company can only commence business and borrow on the issue
of a s 761 certificate by the Registrar of Companies, whereas a private company can commence business and borrow on incorporation.
(d) As regards share capital. The minimum allotted share capital of a public company is
Â£50,000, whereas there is no minimum capital requirement for a private company.
A public company has an unrestricted right to offer shares or debentures to the public,
whereas this is prohibited in the case of a private company. The pre-emption rights of the
2006 Act apply to public companies which must offer equity share capital first to existing
shareholders. These provisions apply also to a private company though they may be
excluded by the articles. Under s 656 where a public company has lost half or more of its
share capital it must call a general meeting, whereas this provision is not applicable to
private companies. Finally, as regards a lien or charge on its own shares, this is restricted
âž¨ See p. 226 in the case of public companies by s 670 (see Chapter 11 âž¨). The provisions are not
applicable to private companies which may take a lien or charge on their shares.
(e) As regards payment for shares. In the case of public companies, any agreement under
which shares are to be allotted by an undertaking to carry out work or perform services
is prohibited (s 585) but is allowed in the case of private companies. The subscribers to
the memorandum of a public company must pay for their shares in cash, whereas in a

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
private company payment may be in cash or some other consideration. In public companies there is a minimum payment for shares whenever issued (i.e. at least one-quarter
of the nominal value plus the whole of any share premium must be paid up), but in private companies there is no minimum payment requirement. Where shares are to be paid
for by a non-cash asset, public companies are required to ensure that the asset is to be
transferred by contract within five years of the allotment, whereas there is no special
requirement for private companies. Furthermore, public companies must have an independent accountantâ€™s report on the value of the non-cash asset used as consideration for
an issue of shares. This requirement does not apply to private companies.
(f) Acquisition of non-cash assets. A public company cannot validly acquire non-cash assets
valued at one-tenth or more of the companyâ€™s issued share capital from subscribers to the
memorandum in the first two years of its existence as such unless an independent
accountantâ€™s report is received and the members approve by ordinary resolution. These
restrictions do not apply to private companies.
(g) As regards distribution of profits and assets. Where interim accounts are used to support a
proposed distribution these accounts must, in the case of a public company, be filed with
the Registrar of Companies, whereas there is no filing requirement for private companies.
Private companies need only fulfil the basic requirement of profits available for distribution. Public companies must also comply with the capital maintenance rule whereas
âž¨ See p. 162 private companies need not (see further Chapters 8 and 9 âž¨).
(h) As regards loans to directors, etc. Quasi-loans and credit transactions, etc. for directors and
the directors of the companyâ€™s holding company are prohibited with certain exceptions
in the case of public companies, as are loans, etc. to persons connected with the directors
and the directors of any holding company. Quasi-loans and credit are not so restricted in
private companies nor are, in general, such dealings with connected persons (see further
âž¨ See p. 334 Chapter 17 âž¨).
(i) An essential feature of more recent company legislation has been the move towards the
deregulation of private companies. In particular, company legislation now provides for
written resolutions of private companies which can be passed by members without the
need to call or hold a meeting. Private companies may also opt out of the audit requirement. These matters are considered in more detail in appropriate parts of the text.
Limited and unlimited companies
A registered company may be:
(a) Limited by shares
First it should be noted that limitation of liability refers to the members and not to the company itself. The liability of the company is always unlimited in the sense that it must discharge
its liabilities so long as it has assets to do so.
Limitation of liability by shares may occur on formation, i.e. the company is registered as
such. Where this is so the liability of each member to contribute to the capital of the company is limited to the nominal value of the shares that he has agreed to take up or, if he has
agreed to take up such shares at a premium (i.e. at more than their nominal value), to the total
amount agreed to be paid for such shares. Once the member has paid the company for his
shares, his liability is discharged completely and he cannot be made responsible for making
up the deficiencies of the company or of other shareholders. Furthermore, he has no liability

Classification of registered companies
whatever in respect of unissued shares. Indeed, in Re Baglan Hall Colliery Co(1870) LR 5 Ch
App 346, Giffard LJ stated that it â€˜is the policy of the Companies Act to enable business
people to incorporate their businesses and so avoid incurring further personal liabilityâ€™.
However, in the case of a small private company, the advantages of limited liability tend
to be illusory, since those who give the company a significant amount of credit and bank
overdraft facilities will in practice require personal guarantees from its directors and major
shareholders.
(b) Limited by guarantee
Formerly, companies limited by guarantee could be registered with or without a share
capital. Companies limited by guarantee with a share capital may now not be registered,
though, of course, companies which had registered with a share capital before the 1985 Act
forbade this remain in existence. Since they cannot now have a share capital, they must of
necessity be formed as private companies because the presence of a share capital is fundamental to the definition of a public company. Where there is no share capital the members
have no liability unless and until the company goes into liquidation. When this happens those
who are members at the time are required if necessary to contribute towards the payment of
the companyâ€™s debts and liabilities and the costs of winding-up in accordance with the guarantee. The amount guaranteed will be whatever sum is stated in the statement of guarantee
on formation and it is frequently a small sum such as Â£100, although in some cases the agreed
liability may be substantial and much depends upon the type of company.
The guarantee is not an asset of the company but a mere contingent liability of its members until winding-up. Consequently it cannot be charged by the company as a security nor
can it be increased or reduced by an alteration of the memorandum or by agreement with the
members or by any procedure equivalent to the increase or reduction of share capital
(Hennessy vNational Agricultural and Industrial Development Association[1947] IR 159).
If those who are members at the date of winding-up cannot meet their obligations under
the guarantee or the debts exceed what they are liable to contribute, then the liquidator may
have access to those who were members during the year prior to the commencement of the
winding-up but only in respect of debts and liabilities incurred while they were members.
If a company limited by guarantee has a share capital, its members have two liabilities.
They must pay the issue price of their shares, and must honour their guarantee in the event
of the company being liquidated (Insolvency Act 1986, s 74(3)). There is no benefit to the
company in having such a dual liability and in practice companies limited by guarantee with
a share capital were not formed. The device of the guarantee company is only used where no
share capital is to be issued but the members of the company wish to limit their liability to
contribute towards the companyâ€™s debts and liabilities. Obviously, the members are not
shareholders (except in some of the earlier companies) and membership will often be
acquired by application. Provision is usually made in the articles for a member to resign.
These companies provide a suitable organisation for professional bodies and trade associations which have not received a Royal Charter, particularly since under certain circumstances
there is no need to show the word â€˜limitedâ€™ - which denotes commerciality - as part of the
âž¨ See p. 79 name (see further Chapter 3 âž¨).
Once incorporated as a guarantee company, there is no provision in company legislation
for re-registration as a company limited by shares or vice versa.
It is worth noting that each member has one vote at general meetings (s 284) and is entitled
to appoint a proxy to represent him (see s 324).

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
As regards accounts and audit, accounts must be prepared and audited, and filed at
Companies House. The audit report is similar to that required for other companies but is
addressed to the members, not the shareholders. The audit exemption is available as for other
companies on the turnover, etc., basis.
(c) Unlimited
The personal liability of members of this type of company is the reason why not many of
them exist. They are sometimes formed by those who wish to keep the companyâ€™s accounts
away from the public gaze (see below). In addition, there are advantages in having separate
corporate status and perpetual succession even though these are not accompanied by limited
liability.
Unlimited companies must be private companies since a public company is by definition
a company limited by shares (or by guarantee with a share capital).
Unlimited companies may be formed as such, either with or without a share capital.
A share capital may be used, for example, if the company is trading and making profits, since
the shares are a basis for the distribution of that profit. As regards liability, where there is a
share capital, the members must, even while the company is a going concern, pay for their
shares in full, and if on a liquidation this is not adequate to satisfy all the debts and liabilities
of the company together with the costs of winding-up, the members must contribute rateably
according to the nominal value of their shareholding. Where there is no share capital, the
members contribute equally until all the debts and liabilities of the company plus the costs of
winding-up are paid. In the event of any members defaulting the others are liable to make
good the deficiency as much as is necessary to pay the whole of the companyâ€™s liabilities and
the costs of liquidation.
If the members at the time of commencement of the winding-up cannot collectively contribute enough to pay off the debts and liabilities, the liquidator can go to those who were
members during the 12 months prior to winding-up, but only in respect of debts incurred
while they were members.
Special features of unlimited companies
There are certain special features relating to unlimited companies. For example, an unlimited
company may reduce its capital by extinguishing liability on partly paid shares or even repaying capital to the members by passing a special resolution to that effect and the permission of
the court is not required. In addition, although an unlimited company cannot issue redeemable shares it may, if its articles permit, reduce its capital by buying back the shares of its
members even from out of its capital.
These practices, in theory at least, do not reduce the funds available to creditors on a
winding-up because the members are liable to pay the debts and liabilities of the company
in full on winding-up. However, as regards reduction of capital by purchase of shares, if
the company knew at the time of purchase that the members would not be able to meet
their liabilities on winding-up, the purchase would be set aside as a fraud on the creditors
(Mitchell vCity of Glasgow Bank(1879) 4 App Cas 624).
âž¨ See p. 162 It will be noted in Chapter 8 âž¨ that the difference between the unlimited company and
the private limited company are not now so marked in terms of reduction of share capital,
and purchase by the company of its own shares, because of de-regulation features in the

Classification of registered companies
Companies Act 2006. For example, under a new procedure in s 641, private companies may
pass a special resolution to reduce capital without an application to the court.
In addition, an unlimited company enjoys privacy in regard to its financial affairs because
it need not deliver copies of its annual accounts and the relevant reports to the Registrar
(s 448), not even abridged or modified ones, though it must, under s 431, prepare audited
accounts for its members unless it has taken the audit exemption when unaudited accounts
will suffice.
However, the price of privacy is the unlimited liability of its members. The provision in
regard to the annual accounts does not apply if the company concerned is a subsidiary or
holding company of a limited company or is potentially under the control of two or more
limited companies, including a foreign company, because of share or voting rights which they
hold even though these have not been exercised in concert for the purposes of control.
European company
The EU Council (formerly the Council of Ministers) reached agreement on 20 December
2000 on the legislative framework necessary to establish a European Company Statute. The
legislation came into force on 8 October 2004. Under the statute, a European Company,
called a Societas Europaea(SE), will operate on a Europe-wide basis governed by Community
law directly applicable in all member states. The statute provides for the creation of European
companies in one of four ways:
1 by merging two or more existing public companies from at least two different member states;
2 by forming a holding company promoted by public or private limited companies from at
least two different member states;
3 by forming a subsidiary of companies from at least two member states;
4 by the conversion of a public limited company which for at least two years had a subsidiary
in another member state.
Each SE will be registered on the same register as national companies. Registration will be
in the member state in which the SE has its administrative head office. SEs do not have to have
a public quotation. The minimum capital requirement is 120,000 ECUs to enable mediumsized companies from different member states to create a SE.
The creation of a SE requires negotiations on worker involvement. If it is not possible to
negotiate a satisfactory arrangement with worker representatives, a set of standard principles
laid down in an annexe to the legislation will apply. Employment contracts and pensions are
subject to national law in the member states where headquarters operate. The European
Public Limited-Liability Company Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/2326) implement the above
materials in the UK from 8 October 2004.
The idea is not new but has been held up for some 25 years because of the question of no
worker participation in business decisions in the UK. However, this was changed from 6 April
2005 when employers with at least 150 employees became obliged to inform and consult with
employees on certain of these matters under the Information and Consultation of Employees
Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/3462). This was extended to employers with at least 100 employees
from 6 April 2007 and to those with at least 50 from 6 April 2008. The application form for
registration of an SE requires confirmation to be given that employee participation procedures are in place.

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Lifting the corporate veil
The principle set out in Salomon vSalomon & Co Ltd(1897) (i.e. that a body corporate is a
separate entity, separate that is from its members), led to the use of the phrase â€˜the veil of
incorporationâ€™, which is said to hang between the company and its members and, in law at
least, act as a screen between them.
However, the principle can cause difficulty and in a number of cases is lifted by the law so
that the human and commercial reality behind the corporate personality can be taken account
of. The veil may be lifted by the judiciary or by statute.
The judiciary
It is difficult to be precise about the circumstances in which a judge will lift the corporate veil.
However, what is clear is that on occasions the Salomondecision has caused problems and the
courts have had to remove the veil of incorporation to enable them to see the commercial
reality behind the corporate personality. But, it is important to bear in mind that there are
only a few examples of the courts removing the veil of incorporation. The overriding concern
is to protect the corporate form; there is a great reluctance by the courts to depart from the
Salomonprinciple.
Yet, it is clear that the courts will remove the veil of incorporation in cases where the incorporator is trying to avoid an obligation or achieve an unfair advantage. In other words, where
there is an abuse of the corporate form. There are some occasions where it is clear that the
courts will â€˜removeâ€™ the veil, yet the important thing to remember is that any list, including
the one that follows, is not exhaustive and it is not known where the boundary lies between a
court lifting/removing a veil of incorporation and leaving it intact. One of, if not theimportant case, in this area is that of Adams vCape Industries.
Adamsv Cape Industr ies plc[1990] Ch 433, CA
Until 1979, Cape, an English company, mined and marketed asbestos. Its worldwide marketing
subsidiary was another English company, Capasco. It also had a US marketing subsidiary incorporated in Illinois, NAAC. In 1974, some 462 plaintiffs sued Cape, Capasco, NAAC and others in
Tyler, Texas, for personal injuries allegedly arising from the installation of asbestos in a factory.
These actions were settled. Between 1978 and 1979, a further 206 similar actions were commenced and default judgments entered against Cape and Capasco. In 1978, NAAC ceased to
carry on business and other subsidiaries replaced it. The plaintiffs sought to enforce the judgments
in England. The defendants denied that the Texas court had jurisdiction over them for the purposes
of English law.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that the defendants were neither present within the USA, nor had
they submitted to the jurisdiction there. The method of computing damages of the individual plaintiffs was contrary to the English law concept of natural justice. Accordingly, the actions would be
dismissed. Slade LJ stated:
The â€˜single economic unitâ€™ argument
There is no general principle that all companies in a group of companies are to be regarded as one.
On the contrary, the fundamental principle is that â€˜each company in a group of companies (a relatively

Lifting the corporate veil
modern concept) is a separate legal entity possessed of separate legal rights and liabilitiesâ€™: The
Albazero [1977] AC 774, 807, perRoskill LJ.
It is thus indisputable that each of Cape, Capasco, NAAC and CPC were in law separate legal
entities. Mr Morison did not go so far as to submit that the very fact of the parent-subsidiary relationship existing between Cape and NAAC rendered Cape or Capasco present in Illinois. Nevertheless,
he submitted that the court will, in appropriate circumstances, ignore the distinction in law between
members of a group of companies treating them as one, and that broadly speaking, it will do so whenever it considers that justice so demands. In support of this submission, he referred us to a number
of authorities...
Principally, in reliance on those authorities and the case next to be mentioned, Mr Morison submitted that in deciding whether a company had rendered itself subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign
court it is entirely reasonable to approach the question by reference to â€˜commercial realityâ€™. The risk
of litigation in a foreign court, in his submission, is part of the price which those who conduct extensive business activities within the territorial jurisdiction of that court properly have to pay...
We have some sympathy with Mr Morisonâ€™s submissions in this context. To the layman at least the
distinction between the case where a company itself trades in a foreign country and the case where
it trades in a foreign country through a subsidiary, whose activities it has full power to control, may
seem a slender one...It is not surprising that in many cases such as Holdsworth[1955] 1 WLR 352,
Scottish Co-operative[1959] AC 324, Revlon[1980] FSR 85 and Commercial Solvents[1974] ECR
223, the wording of a particular statute or contract has been held to justify the treatment of parent
and subsidiary as one unit, at least for some purposes. The relevant parts of the judgments in the DHN
case [1976] 1 WLR 852 must, we think, likewise be regarded as decisions on the relevant statutory
provisions for compensation, even though these parts were somewhat broadly expressed, and the
correctness of the decision was doubted by the House of Lords in Woolfsonv Strathclyde Regional
Council1978 SLT 159 in a passage which will be quoted below.
Mr Morison described the theme of all these cases as being that where legal technicalities would
produce injustice in cases involving members of a group of companies, such technicalities should not
be allowed to prevail. We do not think that the cases relied on go nearly so far as this. As Sir Godfray
submitted, save in cases which turn on the wording of particular statutes or contracts, the court is not
free to disregard the principle of Salomonv A. Salomon & Co Ltd[1897] AC 22 merely because it
considers that justice so requires. Our law, for better or worse, recognises the creation of subsidiary
companies, which though in one sense the creatures of their parent companies, will nevertheless
under the general law fall to be treated as separate legal entities with all the rights and liabilities which
would normally attach t o separate legal entities.
In deciding whether a company is present in a foreign country by a subsidiary, which is itself present in that country, the court is entitled, indeed bound, to investigate the relationship between the
parent and the subsidiary. In particular, that relationship may be relevant in determining whether the
subsidiary was acting as the parentâ€™s agent and, if so, on what terms. In Firestone Tyre and Rubber
Co Ltdv Lewellin[1957] 1 WLR 464 (which was referred to by Scott J) the House of Lords upheld an
assessment to tax on the footing that, on the facts, the business both of the parent and subsidiary
were carried on by the subsidiary as agent for the parent. However, there is no presumption of any
such agency. There is no presumption that the subsidiary is the parent companyâ€™s alter ego. In the
court below the judge, ante, p. 484B, refused an invitation to infer that there existed an agency agreement between Cape and NAAC comparable to that which had previously existed between Cape and
Capasco and that refusal is not challenged on this appeal. If a company chooses to arrange the affairs
of its group in such a way that the business carried on in a particular foreign country is the business
of its subsidiary and not its own, it is, in our judgment, entitled to do so. Neither in this class of case
nor in any other class of case is it open to this court to disregard the principle of Salomon v
A Salomon & Co Ltd[1897] AC 22 merely because it considers it just so to do...
The â€˜corporate veilâ€™ point
Quite apart from cases where statute or contract permits a broad interpretation to be given to references to members of a group of companies, there is one well-recognised exception to the rule

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
prohibiting the piercing of â€˜the corporate veilâ€™. Lord Keith of Kinkel referred to this principle in
Woolfsonv Strathclyde Regional Council, 1978 SLT 159 in the course of a speech with which Lord
Wilberforce, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton and Lord Russell of Killowen agreed. With reference to the
DHNdecision [1976] 1 WLR852, he said, at p. 161: â€˜I have some doubts whether in this respect the
Court of Appeal properly applied the principle that it is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil only
where special circumstances exist indicating that it is a mere faÃ§ade concealing the true factsâ€™...
Mr Morison submitted that the court will lift the corporate veil where a defendant by the device of
a corporate structure attempts to evade (i) limitations imposed on his conduct by law; (ii) such rights of
relief against him as third parties already possess; and (iii) such rights of relief as third parties may in the
future acquire. Assuming that the first and second of these three conditions will suffice in law to justify
such a course, neither of them applies in the present case. It is not suggested that the arrangements
involved any actual or potential illegality or were intended to deprive anyone of their existing rights.
Whether or not such a course deserves moral approval, there was nothing illegal as such in Cape
arranging its affairs (whether by the use of subsidiaries or otherwise) so as to attract the minimum
publicity to its involvement in the sale of Cape asbestos in the United States of America. As to condition (iii), we do not accept as a matter of law that the court is entitled to lift the corporate veil as against
a defendant company which is the member of a corporate group merely because the corporate structure
has been used so as to ensure that the legal liability (if any) in respect of particular future activities of
the group (and correspondingly the risk of enforcement of that liability) will fall on another member of the
group rather than the defendant company. Whether or not this is desirable, the right to use a corporate
structure in this manner is inherent in our corporate law. Mr Morison urged on us that the purpose of
the operation was in substance that Cape would have the practical benefit of the groupâ€™s asbestos
trade in the United States of America without the risks of tortious liability. This may be so. However,
in our judgment, Cape was in law entitled to organise the groupâ€™s affairs in that manner and (save in
the case of AMC to which special considerations apply) to expect that the court would apply the principle of Salomonv A Salomonin the ordinary way [...] We reject the â€˜corporate veilâ€™ argument...
The â€˜agency argumentâ€™ in relation to NAAC
We now proceed to consider the agency argument in relation to NAAC on the footing, which we consider to be the correct one, that NAAC must for all relevant purposes be regarded as a legal entity
separate from Cape/Capasco...
Having regard to the legal principles stated earlier in this judgment, and looking at the facts of the
case overall, our conclusion is that the judge was right to hold that the business carried on by NAAC
was exclusively its own business, not the business of Cape or Capasco, and that Cape and Capasco
were not present within the United States of America, through NAAC at any material time. We see no
sufficient grounds for disturbing this finding of fact.
For the purpose of enforcement of a foreign judgment, the defendant would only be regarded as
falling under the jurisdiction of the foreign court where it was present within the jurisdiction or had
submitted to such jurisdiction.
It may be said that the judiciaryâ€™s power to lift the veil is a tactic used by the courts in a
flexible way so as to counter fraud, sharp practice, oppression and illegality. In Conway v
Ratiu[2006] 1 All ER 571, Auld LJ noted the â€˜readiness of the courts, regardless of the precise
issue involved, to draw back the corporate veil to do justice when common sense and reality
demand itâ€™. However, this view must be tempered by the vast amount of case law in the area
which indicates that the judiciaryâ€™s focus is upon safeguarding the corporate form and
preventing fraudulent practice as opposed to dispensing â€˜justice for allâ€™ via this avenue
(see below). As noted earlier in this chapter, there is no substitute for reading the academic
articles in this area which are outlined at the end of this chapter. Examples of special areas
of application are as follows:

Lifting the corporate veil
(a) Abuse of the corporate form
One of the fundamental areas where the courts appear willing to lift the corporate veil is
where the corporate form is being used as a â€˜faÃ§adeâ€™, â€˜shamâ€™ or as a â€˜maskâ€™ so as to evade existing liabilities or to defeat the law.
Here the courts have been prepared to investigate sharp practice by individuals who are
trying to hide behind a company front. Thus, in Gilford Motor Cov Horne[1933] Ch 935 a
former employee bound by a restraint of trade set up a company in order to evade its provisions, claiming that he as a person might be bound by the restraint but the company, being a
separate entity, could not be. An injunction to prevent solicitation of Gilfordâ€™s customers was
granted against both him and his company which the court described as â€˜a device, a stratagem
[...] a mere cloak or shamâ€™. In this regard, Lord Hanworth MR observed:
Farwell J heard the evidence about that company and had these documents before him. He says
this: â€˜The defendant company is a company which, on the evidence before me, is obviously
carried on wholly by the defendant Horne. Mrs Horne, one of the directors, is not, so far as any
evidence I have had before me, taking any part in the business or the management of the business. The son, whose initials are â€œJ Mâ€, is engaged in a subordinate position in that company,
and the other director, Howard, is an employee of the company. As one of the witnesses said in
the witness-box, in all dealings which he had had with the defendant company the â€œbossâ€ or the
â€œguvnorâ€, whichever term is the appropriate one, was the defendant Horne, and I have not any
doubt on the evidence I have had before me that the defendant company was the channel
through which the defendant Horne was carrying on his business. Of course, in law the
defendant company is a separate entity from the defendant Horne, but I cannot help feeling
quite convinced that at any rate one of the reasons for the creation of that company was the
fear of Mr Horne that he might commit breaches of the covenant in carrying on the business,
as, for instance, in sending out circulars as he was doing, and that he might possibly avoid
that liability if he did it through the defendant company. There is no doubt that the defendant
company has sent out circulars to persons who were at the crucial time customers of the plaintiff company.â€™
Now I have recalled that portion of the judgment of Farwell J, and I wish in clear terms to
say that I agree with every word of it. I am quite satisfied that this company was formed as a
device, a stratagem, in order to mask the effective carrying on of a business of Mr E B Horne.
The purpose of it was to try to enable him, under what is a cloak or a sham, to engage in business which, on consideration of the agreement which had been sent to him just about seven
days before the company was incorporated, was a business in respect of which he had a fear that
the plaintiffs might intervene and object.
Now this action is brought by the plaintiffs, the Gilford Motor Company Ltd, to enforce the
terms of clause 9 of the agreement of 30 May 1929, on the ground that the defendant Horne,
and the company, as his agent and under his direction, have committed breaches of the
covenant which I have read.
Jonesv Lipman[1962] 1 All ER 442
Lipman sold a house to Jones but ultimately refused to complete the sale. In order to ensure that he
would not have to sell the house to Jones, Lipman executed a sham transfer of the house to a company controlled by him (which was in fact a shelf company he had purchased) just before completion
of the sale contract to Jones. Lipman and a clerk of his solicitors were the only shareholders and
directors. Jones applied under Ord 14a for specific performance against Lipman and the company.

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Held- specific performance should be ordered against both. Russell J stated:
The defendant company is the creature of the first defendant, a device and a sham, a mask which he
holds before his face in an attempt to avoid recognition by the eye of equity. The case cited illustrates
that an equitable remedy is rightly to be granted directly against the creature in such circumstances
[...] The proper order to make is an order on both the defendants specifically to perform the agreement between the plaintiffs and the first defendant.
Wallersteinerv Moir[1974] 3 All ER 217
In 1967, the plaintiff (Dr Wallersteiner), a financier, issued a writ claiming damages from the defendant (Mr Moir) for libel contained in a circular letter sent out by the defendant, alleging a series of
unlawful activities on the part of the plaintiff. The defendant served a defence whereby he also
counterclaimed for breaches of the Companies Act 1948 s 54 and s 190, and claimed declarations
that the plaintiff had been guilty of fraud. The plaintiff failed to deliver a reply or defence to counterclaim. Nevertheless, he used the proceedings to stop investigation into his conduct by the company at meetings, on the grounds that the matter was sub judice.
Held- the plaintiffâ€™s delays were â€˜intentional and contumelious and the proceedings could not be
used as a gag to prevent discussionâ€™. The action for libel should be struck out, and there would
be judgment on the counterclaim. Lord Denning MR took the opportunity to make the following
observations with respect to the corporate veil:
Mr Browne-Wilkinson, as amicus curiae, suggested that all these various concerns were used by
Dr Wallersteiner as a faÃ§ade: so that each could be treated as his alter ego. Each was in reality
Dr Wallersteiner wearing another hat. Mr Lincoln, for Dr Wallersteiner, repudiated this suggestion.
It was quite wrong, he said, to pierce the corporate veil. The principle enunciated in Salomon v
Salomonwas sacrosanct. If we were to treat each of these concerns as being Dr Wallersteiner himself under another hat, we should not, he said, be lifting a corner of the corporate veil. We should be
sending it up in flames.
I am prepared to accept that the English concerns were distinct legal entities [...] Even so, I am
quite clear that they were just the puppets of Dr Wallersteiner. He controlled their every movement.
Each danced to his biddin g. He pulled the strings. No one else got within reach of them. Transformed
into legal language, they were his agents to do as he commanded. He was the principal behind them.
I am of the opinion that the court should pull aside the corporate veil and treat these concerns as
being his creatures - for whose doings he should be, and is, responsible. At any rate, it was up to him
to show that anyone else had a say in their affairs and he never did so.
(b) Groups of companies: the human and commercial reality of the group
The court has, on occasion, lifted the veil of incorporation to allow a group of companies to
be regarded as one, because in reality they were not independent either in human or commercial terms.
Re Hellenic and General Trust Ltd[1975] 3 All ER 382
A company called MIT was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hambros Ltd and held 53 per cent of
the ordinary shares of Hellenic. A scheme of arrangement was put forward under which Hambros
was to acquire all the ordinary shares of Hellenic for a cash consideration of 48p per share. The
ordinary shareholders including MIT met and over 80 per cent approved the scheme, MIT voting

Lifting the corporate veil
in support. However, the National Bank of Greece, which was a minority shareholder, opposed
the scheme because it would be liable to meet a heavy tax burden under Greek law as a result
of receipt of cash for its shares. Templeman J refused to approve the scheme on a number of
grounds. However, the one which interests us here is that he ruled that there should have been a
separate class meeting of ordinary shareholders excluding MIT; thus, in effect, regarding the holding company, Hambros, and the subsidiary, MIT, as one economic unit in the class meeting and
not two independent companies with independent interests.
DHN Food Distributorsv Tower Hamlets London Borough Council
[1976] 3 All ER 462
DHN Food Distributors (DHN) was a holding company which ran its business through two whollyowned subsidiaries, Bronze Investments Ltd (Bronze) and DHN Food Transport Ltd (Transport).
The group collected food from the docks and distributed it to retail outlets. Bronze owned the
premises in Bow from which the business was conducted and Transport ran the distribution side
of the business. Tower Hamlets compulsorily acquired the premises in Bow for the purpose of
building houses. This power of compulsory acquisition arose under the Housing Act 1957 and
compensation was payable under the Land Compensation Act of 1961 under two headings: (a) the
value of the land; and (b) disturbance of business. Tower Hamlets was prepared to pay Â£360,000
for the value of the land but refused to pay on the second heading because DHN and Transport
had no interest in the land. This was unfortunate for the group as a whole since the loss of the
premises had caused all three companies to go into liquidation, it being impossible to find other
suitable premises. The practical answer would have been, of course, to have conveyed the
premises from Bronze to DHN when compulsory acquisition was threatened. This had not been
done, although the conveyance would have been exempt from stamp duty since it would have
been a transfer between associated companies. However, Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal
drew aside the corporate veil and treated DHN as owners of the property whereupon Tower
Hamlets became liable to pay for disturbance of business. The basis of Lord Denningâ€™s judgment
was that company legislation required group accounts and to that extent recognised a group entity
which he felt the judiciary should do also. Lord Denning did not feel that it was necessary to imply
an agency between the holding and subsidiary company.
Lord Denning observed â€˜This case might be called the â€œThree in oneâ€. Three companies in one.
Alternatively, the â€œOne in threeâ€, one group of three companiesâ€™, going on to note:
...A further very interesting point was raised by Mr Dobry on company law. We all know that in many
respects a group of companies are treated together for the purpose of general accounts, balance
sheet, and profit and loss account. They are treated as one concern. Professor Gower in Modern
Company Law, 3rd edn (1969), p 216 says: â€˜there is evidence of a general tendency to ignore the
separate legal entities of various companies within a group, and to look instead at the economic entity
of the whole group.â€™
This is especially the case when a parent company owns all the shares of the subsidiaries - so
much so that it can control every movement of the subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are bound hand
and foot to the parent company and must do just what the parent company says. A striking instance
is the decision of the House of Lords in Harold Holdsworth & Co. (Wakefield) Ltdv Caddies[1955]
1 W.L.R. 352. So here. This group is virtually the same as a partnership in which all the three companies are partners. They should not be treated separately so as to be defeated on a technical point.
They should not be deprived of the compensation which should justly be payable for disturbance. The
three companies should, for present purposes, be treated as one, and the parent company DHN
should be treated as that one. So DHN are entitled to claim compensation accordingly. It was not
necessary for them to go through a conveyancing device to get it.

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
I realise that the President of the Lands Tribunal, in view of previous cases, felt it necessary
to decide as he did. But now that the matter has been fully discussed in this court, we must decide
differently from him. These companies as a group are entitled to compensation not only for the value
of the land, but also compensation for disturbance. I would allow the appeal accordingly.
(i) It cannot be said from this case that there is a general principle of group entity. Much depends
upon the circumstances of the case. Thus, in Woolfsonv Strathclyde Regional Council(1978) 38
P & CR 521 the House of Lords did not follow DHN Foods in what was a similar situation because
in Woolfson the subsidiaries were active trading companies and not, as in DHN Foods, mere shells.
Again, in Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical
Services Ltd[1983] 2 All ER 563 the Court of Appeal held, following Salomon, that wholly owned
subsidiaries in a group were separate entities and not the agents of the holding company or each
other in the absence of a specific agency agreement. Furthermore, in Dimbleby & Sons Ltdv NUJ
[1984] 1 All ER 751, a group of companies was regarded as a series of separate entities so that the
picketing of one company within the group by workers employed by another company within the
group was regarded as unlawful secondary picketing for the purposes of s 17 of the Employment
Act 1980. (See now s 224 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.)
(ii) Additional examples in the group situation are to be found in Re H and Others[1996] 2 All ER
391 where in an action by Customs and Excise to restrain defendants who had been charged with
various offences of evading excise duty from dealing with assets pending trial the Court of Appeal
was prepared to restrain subsidiary companiesâ€™ assets, refusing to regard the companies as separate entities under the Salomon rule even though the evasions were alleged to have been committed by the holding company. However, in RePolly Peck International plc (In Administration)
[1996] 2 All ER 433 the High Court applied the Salomonrule in a corporate insolvency, holding that
the separate legal existence of group companies was important where the companies were creditors of the holding company and each wished to make a separate claim in the holding companyâ€™s
insolvency and be paid what is called a dividend on that claim.
(iii) More recently, the court has drawn aside the corporate veil in order that the defence of justification to a claim for defamation could succeed. See Ratiu & Regent House Properties(below).
Ratiu & Regent House Propertiesv Conway[2006] 1 All ER 571
Regent instructed Mr Conway, a solicitor, to act in the purchase and development of a site in
London and related matters. Mr Conwayâ€™s retainer was with the subsidiary. Relationships deteriorated when Mr Conway made a bid for a property in competition with Regent. Following this,
Regent made an allegation of misconduct in regard to his proposed property purchase in that he
was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Regent. Mr Conway brought a claim for defamation against
Regent, contending that his fiduciary duty was owed only to the subsidiary and not to Regent.
Regent defended the claim on the basis of justification (i.e. that the allegations they had made
were true because Mr Conway owed Regent a duty of care as a fiduciary as well as the subsidiary
and that duty of care had been broken as regards Regent also. That, of course, was not the contractual position and to accept that fiduciary duties were owed to Regent it was necessary for the
court to draw aside the corporate veil in favour of Regent and so sustain its defence. This the Court
of Appeal did. It found that throughout the relevant period, Regent had been the â€˜moving spiritâ€™
behind the relevant transactions. In reality, said the court, Mr Conway well knew that his client was
Regent and that the subsidiary was merely a vehicle controlled by Regent. Mr Conway was in
breach of a fiduciary duty to Regent. The decision of the jury in the lower court that Regentâ€™s
defence of justification failed was set aside.

Lifting the corporate veil
The current approach was set down by Robert Goff LJ in Bank of Tokyo Ltdv Karoon [1987]
AC 45, stating â€˜Counsel suggested beguilingly that it would be technical for us to distinguish
between parent company and subsidiary in this context; economically, he said, they were one.
But we are concerned not with economics but with law. The distinction between the two is,
in law, fundamental and cannot be abridged.â€™
(c) Groups of companies: the concept of agency
The concept of agency has sometimes been used by the courts under which a subsidiary is
regarded as the agent of its holding company, even though there is no agency agreement as
such between them in regard to the transaction concerned. The effect is that transactions
entered into by a subsidiary are regarded as those of the holding company for which the holding company is liable. This doctrine has been implemented for purposes of liability to tax.
Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co Ltdv Lewellin[1957] 1 All ER 561
An American company formed a wholly owned subsidiary in England to manufacture and sell its
brand of tyres in Europe. The American company negotiated agreements with European distributors under which the latter would place orders with the American company which the English subsidiary would carry out. In fact, the distributors sent their orders to the subsidiary direct and the
orders were met without any consultation with the American company. The subsidiary received the
money for the tyres sold to the distributors and, after deducting its manufacturing expenses plus
5 per cent, it forwarded the balance of the money to the American company. All the directors of
the subsidiary resided in England (except one who was the president of the American company)
and they managed the subsidiaryâ€™s affairs free from day-to-day control by the American company.
Held- by the House of Lords - that the American company was carrying on business in England
through its English subsidiary acting as its agent and it was consequently liable to pay United
Kingdom tax.
(i) The principle of presumed agency, or agency in fact, of the subsidiary was used in Smith, Stone
& Knight Ltdv Birmingham Corporation[1939] 4 All ER 116. Premises belonging to Smith, Stone
were compulsorily acquired by the Corporation. The question to be resolved was whether the business of waste paper merchants, for which the premises were used, was carried on by Smith, Stone
or by its subsidiary, Birmingham Waste Co Ltd. This was vital because an owner/occupier could
get compensation, but a tenant/occupier like the waste company could not. The court decided that
the waste company occupied the premises as a mere agent of Smith, Stone because, among other
things, it was a wholly owned subsidiary and the directors were the same in both companies.
Smith, Stone was entitled to compensation. This case can be distinguished from DHN Food
Distributorsbecause, as we have seen in the DHNcase, Lord Denning did not find it necessary to
imply an agency.
(ii) The theories of the economic reality of the group and the implied agency approach have
not been used to control abuses in the area of holding and subsidiary companies in regard to
trade creditors. If a subsidiary is insolvent, only public and stock market opinion prevents the
holding company from liquidating the subsidiary leaving its creditorsâ€™ claims unsatisfied even
though the group as a whole is solvent. In some cases even public and market opinion and criticism do not prevent it. The EC Ninth Directive, which has yet to be implemented, does in certain
situations make the dominant company within the group liable for losses incurred by a dependent

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
(d) Illegality
The courts have been prepared to draw aside the veil of incorporation in order to establish
that a company was owned by nationals of an enemy country so that to do business with it
would be illegal because it would be trading with the enemy.
Daimler Co Ltdv Continental Tyre & Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd
[1916] 2 AC 307
After the outbreak of war with Germany, the tyre company, which was registered in England and
had its registered office there, sued the Daimler Company for money due in respect of goods supplied to Daimler before the outbreak of war. Daimlerâ€™s defence was that, since the tyre companyâ€™s
members and officers were German, to pay the debt would be to trade with the enemy, and that,
therefore, the claim by the tyre company should be struck out, i.e. not allowed to go to trial.
Evidence showed that all the members of the tyre company save one were German. The secretary
of the company, who held one share, lived in England and was a British subject. He brought the
action in the name of, and on behalf of, the company. Lord Parker of Waddington stated:
No one can question that a corporation is a legal person distinct from its corporators; that the relation of a shareholder to a company, which is limited by shares, is not in itself the relation of principal
and agent or the reverse; that the assets of the company belong to it and the acts of its servants and
agents are its acts, while its shareholders, as such, have no property in the assets and no personal
responsibility for those acts. The law on the subject is clearly laid down in a passage in Lord
Halsburyâ€™s judgment in Salomonv Salomon & Coâ€˜I am simply hereâ€™, he says, â€˜dealing with the provisions of the statute, and it seems to me to be essential to the artificial creation that the law should
recognise only that artificial existence - quite apart from the motives or conduct of individual corporators....Short of such proofâ€™ - i.e., proof in appropriate proceedings that the company had no real
legal existence - â€˜it seems to me impossible to dispute that once the company is legally incorporated
it must be treated like any other independent person with its rights and liabilities appropriate to itself,
and that the motives of those who took part in the formation of the company are absolutely irrelevant
in discussing what those rights and liabilities are.â€™ I do not think, however, that it is a necessary corollary of this reasoning to say that the character of its corporators must be irrelevant to the character
of the company; and this i s crucial, for the rule against trading with the enemy depends upon enemy
character.
A natural person, though an English-born subject of His Majesty, may bear an enemy character
and be under liability and disability as such by adhering to His Majestyâ€™s enemies. If he gives them
active aid, he is a traitor; but he may fall far short of that and still be invested with enemy character.
If he has what is known in prize law as a commercial domicil among the Kingâ€™s enemies, his merchandise is good prize at sea, just as if it belonged to a subject of the enemy Power. Not only actively,
but passively, he may bring himself under the same disability. Voluntary residence among the enemy,
however passive or pacific he may be, identifies an English subject with His Majestyâ€™s foes. I do not
think it necessary to cite authority for these well-known propositions, nor do I doubt that, if they had
seemed material to the Court of Appeal, they would have been accepted.
How are such rules to be applied to an artificial person, incorporated by forms of law? As far as
active adherence to the enemy goes, there can be no difference, except such as arises from the fact
that a companyâ€™s acts are those of its servants and agents acting within the scope of their authority.
An illustration of the application of such rules to a company (as it happens a company of neutral incorporation, which is an a fortiori case) is to be found in Netherlands South African Ry Cov Fisher.
In the case of an artificial person what is the analogue to voluntary residence among the Kingâ€™s
enemies? Its impersonality can hardly put it in a better position than a natural person and lead to its
being unaffected by anything equivalent to residence. It is only by a figure of speech that a company
can be said to have a nationality or residence at all. If the place of its incorporation under municipal

Lifting the corporate veil
law fixes its residence, then its residence cannot be changed, which is almost a contradiction
in terms, and in the case of a company residence must correspond to the birthplace and country of
natural allegiance in the case of a living person, and not to residence or commercial domicil.
Nevertheless, enemy character depends on these last. It would seem, therefore, logically to follow
that, in transferring the application of the rule against trading with the enemy from natural to artificial
persons, something more than the mere place or country of registration or incorporation must be
looked at.
My Lords, I think that the analogy is to be found in control, an idea which, if not very familiar in
law, is of capital importance and is very well understood in commerce and finance. The acts of a companyâ€™s organs, its directors, managers, secretary, and so forth, functioning within the scope of their
authority, are the companyâ€™s acts and may invest it definitively with enemy character. It seems to me
that similarly the character of those who can make and unmake those officers, dictate their conduct
mediately or immediately, prescribe their duties and call them to account, may also be material in a
question of the enemy character of the company. If not definite and conclusive, it must at least be
prima facie relevant, as raising a presumption that those who are purporting to act in the name of the
company are, in fact, under the control of those whom it is their interest to satisfy. Certainly I have
found no authority to the contrary. Such a view reconciles the positions of natural and artificial persons in this regard, and the opposite view leads to the paradoxical result that the Kingâ€™s enemies, who
chance during war to constitute the entire body of corporators in a company registered in England,
thereby pass out of the range of legal vision, and, instead, the corporation, which in itself is incapable
of loyalty, or enmity, or residence, or of anything but bare existence in contemplation of law and registration under some system of law, takes their place for almost the most important of all purposes,
that of being classed among the Kingâ€™s friends or among his foes in time of war.
What is involved in the decision of the Court of Appeal is that, for all purposes to which the character and not merely the rights and powers of an artificial person are material, the personalities of the
natural persons, who are its corporators, are to be ignored. An impassable line is drawn between the
one person and the others. When the law is concerned with the artificial person, it is to know nothing
of the natural persons who constitute and control it. In questions of property and capacity, of acts
done and rights acquired or liabilities assumed thereby, this may be always true. Certainly it is so for
the most part. But the character in which property is held, and the character in which the capacity to
act is enjoyed and acts are done, are not in pari materia. The latter character is a quality of the company itself, and conditions its capacities and its acts. It is not a mere part of its energies or acquisitions, and if that character must be derivable not from the circumstances of its incorporation which
arises once for all, but from qualities of enmity and amity, which are dependent on the chances of
peace or war and are attributable only to human beings, I know not from what human beings that
character should be derived, in cases where the active conduct of the companyâ€™s officers has not
already decided the matter, if resort is not to be had to the predominant character of its shareholders
and corporators...
Held- by the House of Lords - that the action must be struck out. Although the place of registration and the situation of the registered office normally governs the companyâ€™s nationality and domicile for the purposes of actions at law, the court has a jurisdiction to draw aside the corporate veil
in some cases to see who the persons in control of the companyâ€™s affairs are. If, as here, the persons in actual control of the company were enemy aliens, the company could be so regarded for
the purposes of the law relating to trading with the enemy.
(e) The personal relationship company
A breakdown in the management of the company or the complete exclusion of a member
director from participation in management have been redressed by winding up the company on the just and equitable ground by regarding the company as in fact, if not in form,
a partnership.

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Ebrahimiv Westbourne Galleries[1972] 2 All ER 492
Since 1945 Mr Ebrahimi and Mr Nazar had carried on a partnership which dealt in Persian and other
carpets. They shared equally the management and profits. In 1958 they formed a private company
carrying on the same business and were appointed its first directors. Soon after the companyâ€™s
formation, Mr George Nazar, Mr Nazarâ€™s son, was made a third director. By reason of their shareholdings, Mr Nazar and George had the majority of votes at general meetings. The company made
good profits, all of which were distributed as directorsâ€™ remuneration and no dividend was ever
paid. In 1969 Mr Ebrahimi was removed from the position of director by a resolution at a general
meeting in pursuance of what is now s 168. Mr Ebrahimi presented a petition seeking an order
under s 210 of the Companies Act 1948 (see now s 994, 2006 Act) that Mr Nazar and George should
purchase his shares or, alternatively, an order under what is now s 122(1)(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986
that the company be wound up. At first instance Plowman J refused the order under s 210 because
the oppression alleged was against Mr Ebrahimi in his capacity as director and not that as member. However, the petition for a compulsory winding-up was granted because, in the opinion of
Plowman J, it was just and equitable that the company should be wound up. The Court of Appeal
affirmed the decision of Plowman J under s 210 but dismissed the petition for a compulsory
winding-up, regarding it as an unjustifiable innovation in the company situation. On further appeal,
the House of Lords reversed the Court of Appeal and restored the decision of Plowman J that an
order for winding-up should be made. The major points arising from the case are as follows:
(a) The majority shareholders, Mr Nazar and George, had made use of their undisputed right under
what is now s 168, CA 2006 to remove a director, namely Mr Ebrahimi. Could such use of
a statutory right be a ground for making a compulsory winding-up order under what is now
s 122(1)(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986? In other words, could the exercise of a legal right be
regarded as contravening the rules of equity which are the basis of what is now s 122(1)(g)?
(b) The House of Lords answered these questions in the affirmative, at least for companies
founded on a personal relationship, i.e. for companies which in essence were partnerships,
though in form they had assumed the character of a company: â€˜[...] a limited company is more
than a mere judicial entity, with a personality in law of its own: [...] there is room in company
law for recognition of the fact that behind it, or amongst it, there are individuals, with rights,
expectations and obligations inter se which are not necessarily submerged in the company
structure. That structure is defined by the Companies Act [...] and by the articles of association by which shareholders agree to be bound. In most companies and in most contexts,
this definition is sufficient and exhaustive, equally so whether the company is large or small.
The â€œjust and equitableâ€ provision does not, as the respondents suggest, entitle one party to
disregard the obligations he assumes by entering a company, nor the court to dispense him
from it. It does, as equity always does, enable the court to subject the exercise of legal rights
to equitable considerations; considerations, that is, of a personal character, arising between
one individual and another, which may make it unjust, or inequitable, to insist on legal rights,
or to exercise them in a particular wayâ€™, said Lord Wilberforce.
(c) The decision makes an important contribution to the movement for harmonisation of European
company law. The concept of the private company founded on a personal relationship has
been approximated to the continental European concept. For example, it is accepted in Germany
and France that the private company is a special association and not merely a variety of a
general concept of companies and they are governed by different enactments.
(d) The partnership analogy is an example of the drawing aside of the corporate veil, i.e. treating
a company as a partnership. Once this has been done, partnership law applies and under this
each general (not salaried) partner is, in the absence of contrary agreement, entitled to a say in
management (see Partnership Act 1890, s 24(5)). The same is true of a limited liability partnership
under Reg 7 of the Limited Liability Partnership Regulations 2001. Furthermore, the definition

Lifting the corporate veil
of partnership requires that the partners be in business â€˜in commonâ€™ which they obviously are not
if one or more of them is deprived of a say in management. A general partner who is deprived
of a say in management is, in the absence of a contrary agreement, entitled to dissolve the firm.
However, the partnership analogy would not necessarily be applied to all private companies. The
analogy is most likely to be used where, as in the Westbournecase, the proprietors (members) and
the managers (directors) are one and the same, as full general partners in a partnership are.
(i) For the possibility, in more recent times, of using the more versatile remedy of â€˜unfair prejudiceâ€™
âž¨ See p. 312 under s 994, see Chapter 16 âž¨.
(ii) It should also be noted that the Nazars did not offer to buy Mr Ebrahimiâ€™s shares. If they had
done so, e.g. at a fair price to be decided by the companyâ€™s auditors, the court may not have
wound the company up so that Mr Ebrahimi could get his share capital back. A pretty drastic
âž¨ See p. 328 remedy, though, to wind up a solvent company just to achieve this (see also Chapter 16 âž¨).
Statutory provisions
A good starting point for the discussion of such statutory provisions is Lord Diplockâ€™s statement in Dimbleby & Sons Ltd v National Union of Journalists [1984] 1 WLR 427 when he
observed: â€˜The corporate veil in the case of companies incorporated under the Companies
Acts is drawn by statute and it can be pierced by some other statute if such statute so provides;
but, in view of its raison dâ€™etre and its constant recognition by the courts since Salomon v
A. Salomon & Co Ltd, one would expect that any parliamentary intention to pierce the corporate veil be expressed in clear and unequivocal language.â€™
(a) Section 761, Companies Act 2006
It will be recalled that by reason of s 761 a plc cannot commence trading or exercise borrowing powers unless and until it has received a s 761 certificate from the Registrar. If it does so,
the transactions are enforceable against the company but if the company fails to meet its
obligations within 21 days of being called upon to do so the directors are, under s 767, jointly
and severally liable to indemnify a person who has suffered loss or damage by reason of the
companyâ€™s failure to meet its obligations. This is a further example of liability in the directors
to pay, e.g. the companyâ€™s debts, and no proof of fraud is required.
(b) Section 405, Companies Act 2006
This provides that where there is a holding and subsidiary relationship between companies
the holding company is required, subject to certain exceptions already referred to, not only
to prepare its individual accounts but also group accounts. This suggests that for financial
purposes the companies within a group are one.
Finally, there are a number of examples to be found in the law relating to corporate insolvency. Thus, when a company goes into liquidation and the evidence shows that the directors
have negligently struggled on for too long with an insolvent company in the hope that things
would get better but which has, in the end, gone into insolvent liquidation, there are provisions in the Insolvency Act 1986 under which the directors concerned may, if the company
goes into liquidation, be required by the court, on the application of the liquidator, to make
such contribution to the companyâ€™s assets as the court thinks proper. This means in effect that
the directors will be paying or helping to pay the companyâ€™s debts. Further and more detailed

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
considerations will be given to this concept, which is called wrongful trading, and others in
the chapters on directors and corporate insolvency which is where they really belong.
It is worth noting that when offering s 767 together with the insolvency situations as examples of drawing aside the veil to make the members liable for the debts of the company,
these are examples of director liability. They are therefore only truly legitimate examples if the
directors are also members. Since most of the problems in this area occur in private companies where the directors are normally also members, the examples can be given provided it
is made clear that we assume we are dealing with director/members.
Limits on lifting the veil
It should be noted though that concepts such as â€˜fairnessâ€™ and â€˜justiceâ€™ do not play a leading
role in the courtâ€™s consideration of whether or not the corporate veil should be lifted. The prevailing attitude of the judiciary is that those individuals who adopt the corporate form should
expect to take â€˜the â€˜highs with the lowsâ€™. Indeed, this has been highlighted by BrowneWilkinson VC who observed in Tate Access Floors Inc v Boswell [1991] Ch 512: â€˜If people
choose to conduct their affairs through the medium of corporations, they are taking advantage of the fact that in law those corporations are separate legal entities, whose property and
actions are in law not the property or actions of their incorporators or controlling shareholders. In my judgment controlling shareholders cannot, for all purposes beneficial to them,
insist on the separate identity of such corporations but then be heard to say the contrary
when discovery is sought against such corporations.â€™ Thus, as noted earlier, in Woolfson v
Strathclyde Regional Council(1978) 38 P & CR 521 the House of Lords did not follow DHN

In this chapter we are considering the nature of a company. Sometimes examiners ask
students to show an understanding of that by making a comparison with another business
organisation - the partnership. In this connection, it is necessary to note that there are
three forms of partnership in current law. The first and the oldest form is governed by the
Partnership Act 1890 and is referred to here as the ordinary partnership. There is also the limited partnership governed by the Limited Partnerships Act of 1907, and finally the limited
liability partnership governed by the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000. Really the only
sensible comparison in terms of illustrating a knowledge of the nature of a company is with
the ordinary partnership, but the main points of the other two might be included in an
answer. A comparison with the relevant organisations appears below.
The ordinary and limited partnership
A company is created by registration under company legislation. A partnership is created by
agreement which may be express or implied from the conduct of the partners. No special

The ordinary and limited partnership
form is required, though partnership articles are usually written, and, in the case of a limited
partnership, must be written.
From 19 August 2010, Companies House electronic filing services have been enhanced so
as to enable Limited Liability Partnerships to file their information on-line. LLPs will be able
to join the PROOF Scheme (protected on-line filing). Transactions available via the filing service include annual returns, the appointment of corporate members, any changes to membersâ€™
details, and the termination of appointment of members. (See: http://www.companieshouse.
gov.uk/onlinefilingLLP/index.shtml)
Status at law
A company is an artificial legal person with perpetual succession. Thus a company may own
property, make contracts, and sue and be sued. As we have seen, it is an entity distinct from
its members. These partnerships are not legal persons though they may sue and be sued in the
firmâ€™s name. Thus, the partners own the property of the firm and are liable on the contracts
of the firm.
Transfer of shares
Shares in a company are freely transferable unless the companyâ€™s constitution otherwise
provides; restrictions may, of course, appear in the articles of a private company. A partner
can transfer his share in the firm, but the assignee does not thereby become a partner and is
merely entitled to the assigning partnerâ€™s share of the profits.
Number of members
A company whether public or private has no upper limit of membership. For many years
partnerships were, with some exceptions, limited to 20 members. The relevant provision which
was in the Companies Act 1985 has now been repealed and the Companies Act 2006 carries
no upper limit so there is now no contrast to be made in terms of membership requirements.
Management
Members of a company are not entitled to take part in the management of the company
unless they become directors. General partners are entitled to share in the management of the
firm unless the articles provide otherwise.
A member of a company is not by virtue only of that membership an agent of the company,
and he cannot bind a company by his acts. Each general partner is an agent of the firm and
may bind the firm by his acts.
Liability of members
The liability of a member of a company may be limited by shares or by guarantee. The liability of a general partner is unlimited. In a limited partnership one or more of the partners may

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
limit his liability for the firmâ€™s debts to the amount of capital he has contributed, though even
a limited partnership must have at least one general partner. In this connection it should be
noted that a partnership can consist entirely of limited companies in order, for example, to
further a joint venture between them which stops short of merger, and a limited company can
be a partner with individuals as the other partner(s). This will not in either case make the
partnership a limited partnership unless the firm is registered as such under the Limited
Partnerships Act 1907. The liability of a limited company for debt is unlimited in that it is
liable for debt down to its last asset. It is the liability of the members which is limited.
The affairs of a company are closely controlled by company legislation and the company, if it
has started objectives, can only operate within those objects as laid down in its articles of association, though these can be altered to some extent by special resolution. Partners may carry
on any business they please so long as it is not illegal and make what arrangements they wish
with regard to the running of the firm. This position can be taken these days by registered
companies, as the Companies Act 2006 does not require them to have objects clauses, though
they may have them if they so wish.
Termination
No one member of a company can wind up the company (but see exceptionally Ebrahimi),
and the death, bankruptcy or insanity of a member does not mean that the company must
be wound up. A partnership may be dissolved by any partner giving notice to the others
at any time unless the partnership is entered into for a fixed period of time. However,
dissolution by notice depends upon what the partnership agreement, if any, says. If, as in
Mossv Elphick[1910] 1 KB 846, the agreement says that dissolution is only to be by mutual
consent of the partners, then dissolution by notice as described above does not apply. A partnership is, subject to any agreement between the partners to the contrary, dissolved by
the death or bankruptcy of a partner. The partnership agreement will normally provide that
the business is to continue under the remaining partner(s), so the dissolution is only a technical one, though it does leave the continuing partner(s) to deal with the paying out of
the former partnerâ€™s share in the business, usually in line with provisions in the partnership
agreement.
Limited liability partnerships - the Act
The position is as follows.
Formation. A limited liability partnership (LLP) is created by registration of an incorporation document with the Registrar of Companies.
Status at law. An LLP is a body corporate and exists as a separate entity from its members
in the same way as a limited company does. It has unlimited capacity to act and may enter
into contracts and hold property. It continues in existence even though its individual members may change.

Limited liability partnerships - the regulations
Transfer of membership. New members may be admitted by agreement with the existing
members. A person ceases to be a member by following procedures agreed with the other
members. Where there is no formal agreement, a person ceases to be a member by giving
reasonable notice to the other members. Changes in membership must be notified to the
Registrar within 14 days.
Number of members. There is no limit on the number of members in a limited liability
partnership.
Management. There is no requirement for management powers to be set out in a formal
document but it is usual to have one. In the absence of an agreement, the regulations made
under the Act of 2000 set out default provision under which every member may take part in
the management of the LLP.
Agency. Each member is an agent of the LLP and, therefore, can represent it and act on its
behalf in all its business. However, the LLP will not be bound by the actions of a member
where that member does not have authority to act and the person dealing with the member
is aware of this or does not know or believe the member to be a member of the LLP.
Liability of members. The LLP and its assets are primarily liable for the debts and obligations of the firm, and in the ordinary course of business and in respect of debts, for example,
the members will not be personally liable. However, they could lose the capital that they had
invested in the LLP if its assets were exhausted in paying its debts. LLPs can be set up for any
business, but there is perhaps an additional risk for partners in professional organisations
such as accountants and lawyers. Here the individual member has a duty of care at common
law for negligent work, and under the LLP legislation a negligent member, e.g. an accountant
causing loss by negligently prepared accounts, may have his personal assets taken in a payment of damages if the LLPâ€™s assets are insufficient. The non-negligent members would not
be at risk of this. However, it should be noted that this personal liability will be rare since the
claimant will have to show that the member concerned was accepting personal liability.
In most cases the evidence will show that he was intending only to act for the LLP, in which
case only the assets of the LLP will be available to satisfy the claim.
Powers. An LLP has unlimited power to act and will not face any problems of ultra vires
(beyond the powers) even in the restricted sense that it applies to modern companies.
Termination. An LLP can be dissolved by agreement of the members. In the situation where
the LLP is insolvent, creditors can initiate a winding-up and company insolvency procedures
are followed including administration and voluntary arrangements. In a winding-up past and
present members are liable to contribute to the assets of the LLP to the extent that they have
agreed to do so in the LLP agreement.
Limited liability partnerships - the regulations
The Limited Liability Partnerships Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/1090) came into force on 6
April 2001. They support the Act and are vital to an understanding of the operation of the law.
They are quite detailed but in the end, and broadly speaking, apply company provisions to
LLPs with appropriate and necessary change of wording. The regulations provide as follows.

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Accounts and audit exemption
Most of the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986, the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 are applied to LLPs with appropriate modifications. In particular, the requirements
relating to the keeping and retaining of accounting records and the preparation and publication of annual accounts, the form and content of annual accounts and the audit requirement
are applied to LLPs in the same way as to companies with the members of the LLP taking on
the duties of directors and their responsibilities.
There is, however, no requirement to prepare the equivalent of a directorsâ€™ report. A period
of 10 months is given for delivery of accounts to the Registrar of Companies from the end of
the financial year. Small LLPs and medium-sized LLPs will be able to take advantage of the
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applying to small and medium-sized companies, and
the qualifying thresholds are the same. The usual company audit exemptions will apply as will
the dormancy rules.
Financial disclosure: a disadvantage
So far as clients are concerned, one of the major disadvantages to the adoption of LLP status
is the company-style financial disclosure. Even under the regime of abbreviated accounts
financial disclosure may make an LLP vulnerable to commercial pressure. Furthermore,
where it is necessary to disclose the income of the highest paid member of the LLP (which is
where the aggregate profit exceeds Â£200,000) there may be repercussions from clients, creditors
and staff. The government is being pressed to remove the disclosure requirements and, in
general terms, the company analogy is not perfectly made out because disclosure and audit
and accounting rules in a company are to a large extent to protect the shareholders against the
directors. This is not the case with the members/managers of the LLP. In this connection it is
worth noting that American LLPs do not need to disclose financial information at all,
although some states do not permit the formation of LLPs.
Limited liability: alternatives
For those clients who do not wish to move into LLP financial disclosure and find the unlimited liability of one partner an off-putting feature of the limited partnership, there are only
the following alternatives, given the rules of company disclosure:
â— to ensure heavy supervision of competent staff to avoid actionable errors;
â— to negotiate with customers a contractual exclusion or limitation of liability, following
careful drafting of the relevant clause and preferably a price reduction for those customers
who accept the clause;
â— the back-up of insurance where this can be obtained and is not prohibitive in terms of
premiums, as it has become so far as professional indemnity insurance is concerned.
Other provisions
Execution of documents. Instead of the company rule of signature by the company secretary and a director, it is provided that two members of an LLP are to be signatories for valid
execution.

Limited liability partnerships - the regulations
Register of debenture holders. An LLP must keep a register of debenture holders and
debenture holders have a right to inspect it.
Registered office. The Registrar will receive notice of the address of the registered office on
incorporation and must be notified of changes.
Identification. The name of the LLP is to appear outside its place of business and on correspondence and on its common seal if it has one.
Annual return. The regulations provide that an LLP must deliver an annual return to the
Registrar of Companies and set out the requirements as to contents.
Auditors. Subject to the applicability of the audit exemption rules, an LLP is in general
required to appoint auditors. Provision is made for the Secretary of State to appoint auditors
where an LLP is in default. The auditors have various rights including the right to have access
to an LLPâ€™s books, accounts and information as necessary, the right to attend meetings of the
LLP and certain rights in the event of being removed from office or not being re-appointed.
Provision is also made for the resignation of auditors and the making of a statement by a
person ceasing to hold office.
Registration of charges. An LLP is required to register charges with the Registrar of
âž¨ See p. 477 Companies (see Chapter 22 âž¨).
Arrangements and reconstructions. An LLP has power to compromise with its members
and creditors.
Investigations. An investigation of an LLP may be made following its own application or
that of not less than one-fifth in number of its members.
Fraudulent trading. This is punished in the case of an LLP in the same way as a company
trading fraudulently.
Wrongful trading. The law relating to wrongful trading is applied with the necessary changes
in nomenclature to members of an LLP who trade on with an insolvent LLP as it is to the
directors of a company.
Unfair prejudice. Schedule 2 of the regulations applies the Companies Act 2006 so that in
general there is a remedy for the members of an LLP who suffer unfair prejudice. The members of an LLP, however, by unanimous agreement may exclude the right set out in s 994(1)
for such period as may be agreed.
Matters arising following winding-up. There are provisions dealing with the power of the
court to declare a dissolution void, the striking out by the Registrar of Companies of a defunct
company and Crown disclaimer of property vesting as bona vacantia.
Functions of the Registrar of Companies. These are set out in Sch 2 and include the keeping of records of the LLPsâ€™ filed documents on the same lines as for registered companies.
Miscellaneous provisions. These include the form of registers, the use of computers for records,
the service of documents, the powers of the court to grant relief and the punishment of offences.
Disqualification. Part III of the regulations applies the provisions of the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986 to LLPs with appropriate modifications. Under the provisions, members of an LLP will be subject to the same penalties that apply to company directors and may be
disqualified from being a member of an LLP or a director of a company under those provisions.

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
Insolvency. Under Part IV of and Sch 3 to the regulations the insolvency provisions applied
to LLPs include procedures for voluntary arrangements, administration orders, receivership
and liquidation. There are two notable modifications to the company rules, namely:
(a) a new s 214A under which withdrawals made by members in the two years prior to
winding-up will be subject to clawback if it is proved that, at the time of the relevant
withdrawal, the member knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the LLP was or
would be made insolvent;
(b) a modified s 74 providing that in a winding-up both past and present members are liable
to contribute to the assets of the LLP to the extent that they have agreed to do so with the
other LLP members in the partnership agreement.
In effect, therefore, this gives members of an LLP protection in terms of limited liability.
However, the matter is not straightforward. There is no obligation either in the Act of 2000
or the regulations to have a written agreement and the default provisions in Reg 7 do not deal
with the extent of the liability of each member on liquidation. The position is therefore left
ill-defined, there being no relation between capital contributed and liability to contribute to
deficits as there is with companies. In these circumstances insolvency practitioners may find
difficulty in determining the liability of members of an LLP on liquidation. This problem area
underlines once again the need for a written agreement to be made in an LLP governing
the maximum liability of each member on liquidation or stating that a member is to have no
liability so that creditors would have to rely on the assets of the LLP alone. Unfortunately this
situation would not necessarily be known to creditors since there is no requirement to file LLP
agreements so that they are not open to public inspection.
It should be noted that the insolvency provisions relating to limited liability partnerships
are subject to s 14 of the Insolvency Act 2000 since they follow corporate procedures.
This means that if an LLP does business in other countries of the EU and becomes insolvent
it may find that insolvency proceedings may be brought in regard to a place of operations in
a particular EU territory.
LLPs authorised under the financial services regime. There are in corporate law special
insolvency provisions for companies involved in the financial markets because of the special
problems of corporate failure in that field. These provisions contained in Parts XV and XXIV
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 are applied to relevant LLPs.
Default provisions. Part VI of the regulations contains â€˜fall-backâ€™ provisions that apply where
there is no existing limited liability partnership agreement or where the agreement does not
wholly deal with a particular issue. The provisions represent a modification of s 24 of the
Partnership Act 1890. There are provisions relating e.g. to profit share, remuneration, assignment of partnership share, inspection of books and records, expulsion and competition.
LLP or private limited company? - a checklist
Legal uncertainty. The company structure is a long-standing business organisation that is
tried and trusted by advisers. It is set in a well-developed body of law which, over the years,
has acquired a high degree of legal certainty. By contrast, the LLP is a new structure that has
not been tried and tested in terms of its legal framework and legal uncertainty is often
undesirable in business organisations.

Reform - an ordinary partnership with legal personality
Limited liability. This is, for all practical purposes, the same in the corporate and LLP
organisations.
Internal flexibility. Greater flexibility in internal matters and management is claimed for the
LLP as against the private company law requirements. However, this problem is often overstated in the case of the private limited company where the Companies Act 2006 now allows
a high degree of flexibility in decision making, e.g. by the calling of meetings at short notice
and by using the written resolution procedure. Also, the Duomatic principle (discussed in
âž¨ See p. 94 Chapter 4 âž¨) operates to validate the informal unanimous consent of all the members, even
where there has been no written resolution.
The private company does not require the equivalent of an LLP agreement. The articles
of association (the Model Articles) provide standard default arrangements. However, company specific articles are filed with the Registrar of Companies on incorporation, as are alterations to them, so that privacy is lost. The LLP agreement is not filed nor are any alterations
that may be made to it. However, these LLP agreements have not yet been challenged by disputing parties in the courts and their operation is not certain.
In conclusion, the number of LLP registrations continues to be small compared with the
private limited company registrations. Business, in general, would seem to prefer the corporate route, although LLPs have found favour with organisations of professionals because
they provide for a form of limited liability within the partnership ethos.
Reform - an ordinary partnership with legal personality
The Law Commission has issued a Consultation Paper on Partnership Law in response to a
request from the DTI. There are also proposals regarding partnerships in Scotland made by
the Scottish Law Commission that are not considered here. The review is being conducted in
respect of the provisions of the Partnership Act 1890, many but not all of which operate as
default provisions in the absence of a contrary agreement of the partners, and the Limited
Partnerships Act 1907. The Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 (see above) is not
involved. The reforms would however, if implemented, narrow the present distinction
between ordinary partnerships and the new limited liability partnership.
Main reform proposals
The three main proposals are:
1 Proposals to introduce separate legal personality. There are two sub-proposals here:
(a) to confer legal personality on all partnerships without registration. There would be a
transitional period to allow the parties to a partnership agreement to organise their
affairs or to opt out of the continuing aspect of separate personality of the firm.
(b) to make legal personality depend on registration. Under this sub-proposal only a registered partnership would have legal personality capable of continuing regardless of
changes in the membership of the firm. Under this option non-registered partnerships
would not have legal personality.
The Commission feels that having a system of registration would create a more complex
situation in which there would be a legal environment for registered partnerships and

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
another for non-registered firms. The Commission also feels that many small firms would
not register and so lose the benefits of legal personality.
On balance therefore the provisional view of the Commission is the first option, i.e.
continuity of legal personality without registration, and views are invited on this. The creation of a registered partnership regime would bring partnership law in the UK closer to
those legal systems in Europe in which legal personality is conferred by registration.
2 Proposals to avoid the unnecessary discontinuance of business caused by the dissolution of
the firm under the 1890 Act default rules when one person ceases to be a partner.
3 Proposals to provide a more efficient and cheaper mechanism for the dissolution of a
solvent partnership.
Other reform proposals
The following suggestions for reform are according to the Commission intended to clarify
some of the uncertainties in the 1890 Act; to update provisions which are outdated or spent
and to propose adaptations of existing provisions if in the event consultees support the
separate and continuing legal personality of the firm.
(a) Partnership and agency. With the concept of legal entity the partners would be agents of
the firm but not each other.
(b) Ownership of property. With separate personality the firm would be able to hold property
in its own name. It would not be necessary, as now, to use the device of the trust. Also,
the firm and not the partners would have an insurable interest in partnership property.
(c) Partnersâ€™ liability for the obligations of the firm. As a result of separate personality, the
firm would be primarily liable. A partnerâ€™s liability would be subsidiary but unlimited.
Creditors would normally need to get a judgment against the firm before enforcing the
claim against the assets of the firm or the partners. The liability of partners would be joint
and several for the debts and obligations of the firm.
(d) Partnersâ€™ duties. Partners have a duty to act in good faith in equity already. The Commission proposes to include the duty in a reformed statute and possibly also a duty of skill
and care in negligence. There is a suggestion that partners be relieved of the duty of good
faith when, on the break-up of a firm, they are competing for its client base provided they
act honestly and reasonably.
(e) Litigation. A partnership with a separate legal personality would be sued in its own name
and the partners could be sued in the same action.
(f) Information about the firm including former partners who may have subsidiary liability at
the time of a claim would be available if the partnership was registered. If this is not so, the
Commission proposes an extension to the Business Names Act 1985 requiring display of
such information by the firm administratively.
(g) Floating charges. Currently, partnerships cannot grant floating charges over the firmâ€™s
assets. The Commission makes no proposals on this but invites views.
Advantages and disadvantages of incorporation
The main advantages put forward by professional advisers for the conversion of a business
into a limited company for those who do not wish to incorporate as an LLP can be summarised as follows:

Companies and human rights
1 Perpetual succession of the company despite the retirement, bankruptcy, mental disorder
or death of members.
2 Liability of the members for the companyâ€™s debts limited to the amount of their respective
shareholding.
3 Contractual liability of the company for all contracts made in its name.
4 Ownership of property vested in the company is not affected by a change in shareholders.
âž¨ See p. 477 5 The company may obtain finance by creating a floating charge (see Chapter 22 âž¨) with
its undertaking or property as security yet may realise assets within that property without
the consent of the lenders during the normal course of business until crystallisation (see
âž¨ See p. 477 Chapter 22 âž¨) occurs. As we shall see, no other form of business organisation except an
LLP can sensibly use such a charge.
It is generally thought that the above advantages outweigh the suggested disadvantages of
incorporation which are:
1 Public inspection of accounts (with exceptions in the case of some unlimited companies
and abbreviated or modified disclosure in the case of small and medium companies).
2 Administrative expenses in terms, for example, of filing fees for documents.
3 Cost of compulsory annual audit (unless the company is a dormant company or in a position to opt out).
Companies and human rights
The Human Rights Act 1998 came into force on 2 October 2000. It implements the European
Convention on Human Rights into UK law. The Convention is available to companies in
terms of their dealings with emanations of the state, e.g. government and local authorities.
This is because the initial effect of the Act is vertical. Whether the Convention will be
extended by the courts horizontally into areas of private business remains to be seen, though
s 6 of the 1998 Act provides that the courts and tribunals of the UK must not act contrary to
the Convention. Problems have arisen in connection with the lack of independence in UK
courts and tribunals in that Crown Court recorders were appointed part time and paid by the
state and removable by the state with no security of tenure. The same was true of appointments to employment tribunals in cases involving the state as an employer or an emanation
of the state, such as a local authority. The solution here has been to give these part-time judicial officers fixed-term contracts of, say, five years during which time they are not dismissible
except for misconduct, and this gives some security of tenure. That a company can complain
about the infringements of its human rights in this context (and others no doubt) is illustrated by County Properties Ltd vScottish Ministers (2000) The Times, 19 September, which,
although a Scottish case, is applicable in the rest of the UK. The company, in effect, had been
refused permission by the Crown to obtain the release of the listed building restrictions on
one of its properties and the matter was referred for decision to an inspector appointed by the
Crown. The company objected to this procedure because it infringed Art 6 of the Convention
that provides: â€˜In the determination of his civil rights and obligations [...] everyone is entitled to a [...] hearing [...] by an independent and impartial tribunal.â€™ The Court of Session
held that this was an infringement of the companyâ€™s rights. That part of the procedure was
invalid and the matter would have to be dealt with by appeal to the courts as the relevant

Chapter 1 The nature of a company
legislation allowed. The case was overturned on appeal (County Properties Ltd v Scottish
Ministers2002 SC 79) the court following the same line as in the Barnes case.
The House of Lords took a different view in an appeal from the Divisional Court
of Queenâ€™s Bench in England. Their Lordships felt that the hearing of planning matters by
a government-appointed inspector did not flout Art 6 of the Convention because the inspectorâ€™s decision could always be brought before the ordinary courts by means of a procedure
called judicial review (see R vSecretary of State for the Environment, etc., ex parte Holding
and Barnes plc(2001), The Times, 10 May). Nevertheless, the cases show that companies can
argue human rights matters before our courts.
Action against companies based on human rights
Implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998 on 2 October 2000 raised the spectre of the
litigation floodgates opening since it made the European Convention on Human Rights available to litigants in UK courts, thus avoiding the need to take the matter to the European Court
of Human Rights at Strasbourg, previously the only option. It has already been noted that
the initial effect is against public authorities with the possibility of some expansion into the
private sector through s 6 of the 1998 Act. In this connection, a statement by the Lord Chief
Justice in Daniels vWalker[2000] 1 WLR 1382, CA is of interest. He expressed the hope that
judges would be robust in resisting attempts to allow inappropriate arguments on human
rights. These he defined as arguments that lead the court down blind alleys. There has also
been the suggestion that adverse costs may be awarded against those who raise spurious questions and points on human rights. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal observed in Barclays
Bank plc vEllis(2000) The Times, 24 October that legal representatives seeking to rely on the
Human Rights Act 1998 should supply the court with any decisions of the European Court
of Human Rights on which they intend to rely or which might assist the court. This should
operate as a deterrent to those lawyers who may think of raising human rights issues unless,
where possible, supported by authority.
The specific effect of the Convention on directors is considered, in terms of their functions

Promotion and incorporation

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
The promotion of a company consists in taking the necessary steps to incorporate it by registration under the Companies Act, to see that it has share and loan capital, and to acquire
the business or property which the company is formed to control.
The promoter
There is no general definition of a promoter in the Companies Act 1985. However, Treasury
regulations under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 exempt from liability for false
statements in listing particulars, or a prospectus, those who merely give advice in a professional capacity but do not give specific reports for inclusion as experts. Thus, a solicitor
or accountant who merely advises the promoters on legal and financial matters respectively
will not be considered as a promoter in respect of misrepresentations which appear in any
prospectus issued to raise capital. Nevertheless, accountants, in particular, may be liable as
experts if any of their financial statements are included with their consent in a prospectus and
âž¨ See p. 212 turn out to be false (see further Chapter 10 âž¨).
In addition, the courts have not given the expression â€˜promoterâ€™ a precise definition
although Cockburn CJ, in Twycross v Grant(1877) 2 CPD 469, called a promoter â€˜one who
undertakes to form a company with reference to a given project, and to set it going, and who
takes the necessary steps to accomplish that purposeâ€™. In addition, Bowen J in Whaley Bridge
Printing Co v Green(1880) 5 QBD 109 said:
The term promoter is a term not of law, but of business, usefully summing up in a single word
a number of business operations familiar to the commercial world by which a company is
generally brought into existence.
Thus, it can be said that whether a person is a promoter or not is a matter of fact and
not of law. However, a promoter will usually be in some sort of controlling position with
regard to the companyâ€™s affairs, both before it is formed and during the early stages of its
existence and will be in a position analogous to that of a director during that period.
Basically a promoter is a person who promotes a business project through the medium of
a company.
Those who would normally be regarded as promoters would include persons who authorise the drafting of legal documents such as the articles of association, and who nominate
directors, solicitors, bankers and other agents, together with those who arrange for the placing of shares and who purchase property for the proposed company. The purchaser of a
ready-made company is a promoter because such a person is promoting a company through
the medium of a company.
During the nineteenth century there was in existence a class of professional company promoters whose methods of raising capital from the investing public were often unscrupulous
and thus it was necessary for the legislature and the courts to impose rigorous duties upon
such persons to protect the public from fraud.
Those days have gone and in modern times most companies are promoted as private
companies by persons with an interest in the business who become directors and remain so.
Obviously, some protection is still required because such persons could defraud the company by, for example, selling property to it at exorbitant rates. However, they are not likely
to do so because in the modern situation the promoter retains an interest in the company

The promoter
and would merely be defrauding himself, whereas the old professional promoter either did
not take any shares in the company at all or if he did unloaded them to others shortly after
its incorporation.
If, after incorporation as a private company, there is a need to raise capital from the public then there would be a conversion to a public company. In such a situation there is no need
for a promoter but there would be a need for the services of a specialist organisation such as
a merchant bank to raise the necessary capital from the public.
Duties of a promoter
In equity a promoter stands in a fiduciary relationship towards the company he is promoting
but is not a trustee. Thus he is not absolutely forbidden to make a profit out of the promotion so long as he has disclosed his interest in the transaction out of which the profit arose
and the company consents to the retention of the profit. As a general rule, any profits which
he makes on the promotion and fails to disclose must be surrendered to the company. This is
illustrated by the following case.
Glucksteinv Barnes[1900] AC 240
In 1893 the National Agricultural Hall Co Ltd owned a place of entertainment called the Olympia
Company which was being wound up. A syndicate was formed to raise funds to buy Olympia and
resell it, either to a company registered under the Companies Act for the purpose, or to another
purchaser. If a company was formed, the appellant Gluckstein and three other persons, Lyons,
Hart and Hartley, who were members of the syndicate, had agreed to become its first directors
and to promote it. In the event a company was formed, called the Olympia Company Ltd, and the
promoters issued a prospectus stating that the syndicate which was promoting the company had
purchased Olympia for Â£140,000 and was selling it to the company for Â£180,000 thus quite properly disclosing a profit of Â£40,000. What they did not disclose but referred to vaguely as â€˜interim
investmentsâ€™, was the fact that they had purchased certain mortgage debentures in the old
Olympia Company for less than their face value, and that these mortgage debentures were to be
redeemed at their face value out of the proceeds of the issue of shares. This meant that the syndicate made a further Â£20,000 on the promotion. The company afterwards went into liquidation,
Barnes being the liquidator, and he sought to recover the undisclosed secret profit.
Held - the profit of Â£20,000 should have been disclosed and the appellant was bound to account
to the liquidator for it.
The following points of interest arise from this case:
(i) There had been disclosure by the promoters in regard to the Â£40,000 and Â£20,000 profit to
themselves as directors but of course this was useless because disclosure must be to an independent board (see below).
(ii) The prospectus said that the Â£40,000 profit did not include profits on â€˜interim investmentsâ€™ but
the court held that this was not a disclosure of the profit of Â£20,000.
(iii)The case also illustrates that liability of promoters is joint and several for recovery of profit
because Mr Gluckstein tried to defend himself by saying he was only liable for a proportion of the
profits. The House of Lords held him liable to account for it all with a right of contribution against
his fellow promoters.

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
In Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co (1878) 3 App Cas 1218, the House of Lords
took the view that the disclosure mentioned above had to be made to an independent board
of directors. This view was, however, too strict. The boards of private companies, for example, are unlikely to be entirely independent of the promoter of the company and since
Salomon, where it was held that the liquidator of the company could not complain of the
sale to it at an obvious over-valuation of Mr Salomonâ€™s business, all the members having
acquiesced therein, it has been accepted that disclosure to the members is equally effective.
Thus, if the company issues a prospectus disclosure to the shareholders may be made in it and
the shareholders give their consent by conduct when they apply for the shares being issued
under the prospectus. Disclosure by a person, in his capacity as promoter, to himself, in his
capacity as director, is not enough (Gluckstein v Barnes, 1900, above).
A promoter will perhaps most often make a secret profit by selling his own property to the
company at an enhanced price and this is further considered below. However, other forms
of profit are possible, e.g. where the promoter takes a commission from the person who is
selling property to the company (and see also Gluckstein v Barnes, 1900). All such profits are
subject to the rules of disclosure. The liability of promoters as vendors of property may be
considered under two headings:
(a) Where the property was purchased by the promoter before he began to act
as a promoter
If the promoter does not disclose his interest in the sale, the company may rescind the contract, i.e. return the property to the promoter and recover the purchase price. If the company
wishes to keep the property it may do so, but cannot recover the profit as such (Re Cape
Breton (1887) 12 App Cas 652). The remedy is to sue the promoter for damages in tort at
common law for negligence if damage has been suffered, as where the company has paid a
price in excess of the market price. That this can be done follows from the decision of the
court in Jacobus Marler Estates Ltdv Marler (1913) 114 LT 640n, and in Re Leeds and Hanley
Theatres of Varieties Ltd[1902] 2 Ch 809.
There may be, according to circumstances, an action for fraud, or under s 2 of the
Misrepresentation Act 196 7 where the promoterâ€™s misstatements, e.g. as to value, are made
negligently. Therefore, if P acquired some land in 2008 for Â£10,000 and became the promoter
of X Co in 2009, selling the land to the company for Â£20,000 through a nominee and without
disclosing his interest, then the company may:
(a) rescind the contract; or
(b) keep the property and recover damages for Pâ€™s breach of duty of skill and care.
If the property was worth only Â£18,000 in 2009, the company could recover Â£2,000, but in no
circumstances could it recover the Â£10,000 profit.
(b) Where the property was purchased by the promoter after he began to act as
a promoter
Here, again, the remedy of rescission is available, but if the company does not wish to rescind
it is possible to regard the promoter as agent for the company when he purchased the property, and the company can recover the profit made by the promoter. Thus, in the example
given above, if P had been the promoter of X Co when he purchased the land, the company
could have recovered the profit made, i.e. Â£10,000.

The promoter
One of the first acts in promotion is normally to negotiate for the purchase of property.
However, the courts have been reluctant to hold that the promoterâ€™s contract to buy property
is the start of his promotion and this has deprived the rule about secret profits of much of its
practical value. Obviously, if the public has been invited to subscribe for shares when the
property is purchased, the courts will regard the promotion as having commenced, but things
rarely happen in this way.
The remedy of rescission is not, in general, available against the promoter if it is not
possible to restore the company and the promoter to the position they were in before the
contract was made, as where the company has resold the property to a third party. In such a
case the company must go on with the contract and sue the promoter for the profit made,
depending on the promoterâ€™s position when he bought the property which he later sold to
the company. However, where the property has been merely used and not sold, as where the
company has worked a mine purchased from a promoter, the rule of full restoration to the
former position does not appear to operate as any real restriction on rescission in view of
the wide powers now exercised by the courts to make financial adjustments when granting
rescission. This is particularly true where the promoter has been fraudulent.
The duties of a promoter to the company are derived from common law and have not yet
been fully developed by the judiciary. They are not contractual duties because the company is
not incorporated and cannot contract with the promoter. Nevertheless, a promoter can be
regarded as a quasi-agent working without a contract and as such would at common law owe
a general duty in negligence to exercise reasonable skill and care in the promotion, i.e. to show
reasonable business acumen in regard to transactions entered into.
Thus, if he allows the company to buy property - including his own - for more than it is
worth, he may be liable to the company in damages for negligence (Re Leeds and Hanley
Theatres of Varieties Ltd[1902] 2 Ch 809).
Again, if a promoter issues a prospectus which he knows to be false so that the company is
liable to be sued by subscribers, the company may sue him at common law for damages. In
the Leeds case the court proceeded on the basis of fraud but since the company does not itself
act upon the fraud by subscribing for shares, the decision is felt to be based on negligence.
In other areas, e.g. the purchase by a promoter of a business which loses money, the standard required presumably depends upon the experience and/or qualifications of the promoter
in business fields. A higher standard would be expected of a promoter who was, for example,
an experienced and/or qualified accountant, than would be of a person of no great experience
or qualification in the field of business. The duty may well be analogous to that of directors
âž¨ See p. 378 (see Chapter 19 âž¨).
The equitable and common law duties of a promoter are owed to the company, which may
enforce them by a claim form served by the company on the promoter. Also, by s 212 of the
Insolvency Act 1986, the court may in a liquidation, on the petition of the liquidator or a creditor, or a member, order a promoter to repay or restore property obtained by breach of duty.
A claim by a member of the company under ss 994-996 (unfair prejudice) is, in modern
company law, the way to proceed. Under these sections a member may, regardless of the size
of his shareholding, ask the court to authorise a claim to be brought by the company against
a person who has caused loss to the generality of its members.
The duties are not owed to shareholders who are unable to bring a personal action unless
this relates to false statements made by the promoter in a prospectus.
Trade creditors and debenture holders cannot sue for breach of duty. There was, for example, no action by trade creditors in Salomon although he did not disclose to them his

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
interest in the promotion. However, secret profits or damages recovered by the liquidator in
a winding-up are used to pay the companyâ€™s debts.
The duties of disclosure and skill and care upon promoters do not end on the incorporation of the company, nor indeed on the appointment of a board of directors. However, once
the company has acquired the property and/or business which it was formed to manage, the
initial capital has been raised and the board of directors has effectively taken over management from the promoters, the latterâ€™s duties will terminate. Thus, in Re British Seamless
Paper Box Co (1881) 17 Ch D 467, a promoter disclosed a profit which he had made out of
the companyâ€™s promotion to those who provided it with share capital when it commenced
business. It was held that he was under no duty to disclose that profit to those who were
invited to subscribe further capital some 12 months later and in these circumstances the company could not recover the profit from him by reason of his failure to do so.
Promotersâ€™ dealings with the prospective company:
rules of capital maintenance
Although a promoter is not bound to be a subscriber to the memorandum on incorporation
of a public company, it is very likely that he will be. In these circumstances certain provisions
of the Companies Act 2006 relating to capital maintenance apply.
Section 598 provides that for two years following the date of issue of the certificate that a
company registered as a public company is entitled to commence business, the company may
not acquire (whether for cash or shares) non-cash assets from subscribers to the memorandum having an aggregate value equal to one-tenth or more of the nominal value of the issued
share capital unless:
(a) the valuation rules set out in s 600 are complied with. This means that the asset must have
been valued by an independent accountant who must state that the value of the consideration to be received by the company is not less than the value of the consideration to be
given by it; and
(b) the acquisition of the asset and the terms of the acquisition have been approved by an
ordinary resolution of the company.
Under s 603, the above provisions also apply when a private company converts to a public
company and the non-cash asset is acquired from a person who is a member of the private
company on the date of conversion, i.e. re-registration. The period is two years beginning
with that date. Such members are also, in a way, promoters of the public company.
The above matters are considered in more detail in Chapter 8 but it will be appreciated that
they do operate as a form of control on promoters/subscribers/members, as the case may be,
off-loading property on a public company at above its real value, since if the transaction has
gone through in breach of s 598 the company can recover what it has paid for the asset and,
if it has not gone through, it is not enforceable against the company.
Payment to promoters
Since a company cannot make a valid contract before incorporation, a promoter cannot
legally claim any remuneration for his services, or an indemnity for the expenses incurred in
floating the company.

The promoter
Re National Motor Mail Coach Co Ltd, Clintonâ€™s Claim[1908] 2 Ch 515
A company, called the Motor Mail Coach Syndicate Ltd, promoted another company, called the
National Motor Mail Coach Co Ltd, to acquire the business of a motor mail contractor named
Harris. The promoters paid out Â£416 2s 0d in promotion fees. The two companies were subsequently wound up and Clinton, who was the liquidator of the syndicate, proved in the liquidation
of the National Motor Mail Coach Co Ltd for the promotion fees.
Held - Clintonâ€™s claim on behalf of the syndicate could not be allowed because the company was
not in existence when the payments were made, and could not have requested that they be made.
The syndicate was not acting as the companyâ€™s agent or at its request, and the fact that the
company had obtained a benefit because the syndicate had performed its promotion duties was
not enough.
However, since the promoters or their nominees are likely to be the first directors, the payment will usually be made by the director under their general management powers.
Pre-incorporation contracts: generally
Another consequence of the company having no legal existence and therefore no capacity to
make contracts is that if a promoter, or some other person purporting to act as its agent,
makes a contract for the company before its incorporation then:
(a) the company when formed is not bound by it even if it has taken some benefit under it
(see Re National Motor Mail Coach, etc., above);
(b) the company is unable to sue the third party on the agreement unless the promoter and
the third party have given the company rights of action under the Contracts (Rights of
Third Parties) Act 1999 (see below);
(c) the company cannot ratify the agreement even after its incorporation (Kelner v Baxter
(1866) LR 2 CP 174);
(d) unless the agreement has been made specifically to the contrary, it will take effect as one
made personally by the promoter or other purported agent and the third party (s 51 CA
2006). This is illustrated by the following case.
Phonogram Ltdv Lane[1981] 3 All ER 182
In 1973, a group of pop artists decided that they would perform under the name of â€˜Cheap Mean
and Nastyâ€™. A company, Fragile Management Ltd (Fragile), was to be formed to run the group.
Before the company was formed, there were negotiations regarding the financing of the group.
Phonogram Ltd, a subsidiary of the Hemdale Group, agreed to provide Â£12,000, and the first
instalment of Â£6,000, being the initial payment for the groupâ€™s first album, was paid. Fragile was
never formed; the group never performed under it; but the Â£6,000 was not repaid.
The Court of Appeal was asked who was liable to repay it. It appeared that a Brian Lane had
negotiated on behalf of Fragile and a Roland Rennie on behalf of Phonogram Ltd.
A letter of 4 July 1973 from Mr Rennie to Mr Lane was crucial. It read:
In regard to the contract now being completed between Phonogram Ltd and Fragile Management Ltd
concerning recordings of a group [...] with a provisional title of â€˜Cheap Mean and Nastyâ€™, and further
to our conversation of this morning, I send you herewith our cheque for Â£6,000 in anticipation of a
contract signing, this being the initial payment for initial LP called for in the contract. In the unlikely

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
event that we fail to complete within, say, one month you will undertake to pay us Â£6,000 [...] For
good orderâ€™s sake, Brian, I should be appreciative if you could sign the attached copy of this letter
and return it to me so that I can keep our accounts people informed of what is happening.
Mr Lane signed the copy â€˜for and on behalf of Fragile Management Ltdâ€™. The money was paid
over, and went into the account of Jelly Music Ltd, a subsidiary of the Hemdale Group, of which
Mr Lane was a director.
The court had first to consider whether or not Mr Lane was personally liable on the contract.
Clearly, Fragile could not be sued, since it never came into existence. Lord Denning took the view
that Mr Lane was, as a matter of construction, liable on the contract without recourse to what
is now s 51, because the letter, which was in effect the contract, said: â€˜I send you herewith our
cheque for Â£6,000â€™, and â€˜in the unlikely event that we fail to complete within, say, one month, you
will undertake to repay us the Â£6,000â€™.
However, Mr Justice Phillips at first instance had decided on the basis of a lot of evidence
which he had heard that Mr Lane was not, as a matter of construction, liable personally, and Lord
Denning and the rest of the Court of Appeal proceeded on the assumption that Mr Lane was not
liable on the basis of intention and construction.
Lord Denning then turned to what is now s 51. This states:
A contract that purports to be made by or on behalf of a company at a time when the company has
not been formed has effect, subject to any agreement to the contrary, as one made with the person
purporting to act for the company or as an agent for it, and he is personally liable on the contract
accordingly.
This seemed to Lord Denning to cover the case before him and render Mr Lane liable. Mr Lane
made the contract on behalf of Fragile at a time when the company had not been formed, and he
purported to make it on behalf of the company so that he was personally liable on it.
Mr Laneâ€™s counsel drew the attention of the court to the Directive (68/151) on which s 51 is based.
This states that its provisions are limited to companies en formation (in course of formation),
whereas Fragile never commenced the incorporation process.
Lord Denning rejected this submission saying an English court must under Art 189 of the Treaty
of Rome abide by the statute implementing the Directive, and that contained no restriction relating to the need for the company to be en formation.
Article 189 states:
A Directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each member State to which it is
addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and method.
Counsel for Mr Lane also suggested that the word â€˜purportsâ€™ must mean that there has been a
representation that the company already exists. Lord Denning did not agree with this, saying that
a contract can purport to be made on behalf of a company, or by a company, even though both
parties knew that the company was not formed and was only about to be formed.
The court also decided that the form in which a person made the contract - e.g. â€˜for and on
behalf of the companyâ€™ as an agent, or merely by signing the companyâ€™s name and subscribing his
own, e.g. â€˜Boxo Ltd, J Snooks, managing directorâ€™, where the form is not that of agency - did not
matter and that in both cases the person concerned would be liable on the contract.
As regards the words â€˜subject to any agreement to the contraryâ€™, the court dealt with academic
opinion which had suggested that where a person signs â€˜for and on behalf of the companyâ€™ - i.e.
as agent - he is saying, in effect, that he does not intend to be liable and would not be on the basis
of the words â€˜subject to any agreement to the contraryâ€™.
On this, Lord Denning said:
If there was an express agreement that the man who was signing was not to be liable, the section
would not apply. But, unless there is a clear exclusion of personal liability, [the section] should be

The promoter
given its full effect. It means that in all cases such as the present, where a person purports to contract on behalf of a company not yet formed, then however he expresses his signature he himself is
personally liable on the contract.
(i) The court did not consider, because it did not arise, whether an individual such as Mr Lane
could have sued upon the contract. Section 51 talks about the person or agent being â€˜personally
liableâ€™ on the contract. Perhaps it should say â€˜can sue or be suedâ€™. However, lawyers have generally assumed that the court would give an individual like Mr Lane a right to sue if it arose, since
it is, to say the least, unusual for a person to be liable on a contract and yet not be able to sue
(ii) In fact, the matter was raised in Braymist Ltdv Wise Finance Company Ltd(2001) The Times,
27 March. In that case a solicitor signed a pre-incorporation contract for the sale of land to be
owned by Braymist before that company was incorporated. Later the other party, Wise Finance,
refused to go on with the contract and Braymist after incorporation sued for damages. The solicitor was also a party to the action as a claimant. The High Court ruled that the claim succeeded.
The solicitor was not merely liable on the contract but could also sue for its breach. Such a ruling,
said the court, was workable and fair. Furthermore, the contract did not infringe s 2(1) and (3) of
the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989, which requires a contract concerning
land to be in writing and signed by the parties to it. It was signed by the solicitor who was, under
the provisions of what is now s 51 of the Companies Act 2006, a party to it.
(iii)As we have seen, s 51 can apply to make the promoter or other purported agent liable even
though the company has not actually begun the process of formation. However, it was held in
Cotronic (UK) Ltd v Dezonie [1991] BCC 200 that there must at least be a clear intention to
form the company as there was in Phonogram. In the Cotronic case a contract was made by
Mr Dezonie on behalf of a company which had been struck off the register for five years at a time
when nobody concerned with its business had even thought about re-registering it. The Court of
Appeal held that the contract was a nullity and Mr Dezonie was not personally liable on it under
what is now s 51.
The above difficulties do not worry, for example, a garage proprietor in a small way of
business who is promoting a limited company to take over the garage business. Such a person
will obviously be a director of the new company and will usually hold most of the shares in it.
Being in control, he can ensure that the company enters into the necessary contracts after
incorporation. However, where the promoter is not in control of the company after its incorporation, the difficulties outlined above are very real.
Pre-incorporation contracts: the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999
Under the above Act, the promoter and the third party are able to give the company when
it is incorporated the right to sue and be sued upon a pre-incorporation contract. The Act
makes clear that a party given such rights in a contract (in this case the particular preincorporation contract(s)) does not have to be in existence when the contract is made. Thirdparty rights may be applied by the court even in the absence of an express provision in the
contract between the promoter and the third party if a term of the contract confers a benefit
on the company which, of course, it will do. Nevertheless, an express term should be used to
avoid doubt.

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
Pre-incorporation contracts: solutions to promoterâ€™s liability
A promoter may overcome the difficulties facing him in the matter of pre-incorporation
contracts in the following ways:
(a) He may incorporate the company before he makes contracts, in which case the problems
relating to pre-incorporation contracts do not apply. There is no reason why a promoter
should not take this course since the expenses of incorporation are not prohibitive. There
is, of course, no problem in the case of a ready-made or shelf company. The company
exists and contracts can be made which will be binding on it from the beginning.
(b) He can settle a draft agreement with the other party so that when the company is formed
it enters into a contract on the terms of the draft; but the parties are not bound other than
morally by the draft. However, in order to ensure that the company does enter into the
contract after incorporation the articles of the new company can be drafted to include a
provision binding the directors to adopt it. The promoter is never liable here because
there is never any contract with him.
(c) The promoter may make the contract himself and assign the benefit of it to the company
after it is incorporated. Since English law does not allow a person to assign the burden of
his contract, the disadvantage of this method is that the promoter remains personally
liable for the performance of his promises in the contract after the assignment to the
company. Thus, it is desirable for the other party to the contract to agree that the promoters shall be released from their obligations if the company enters into a new, but
as regards terms identical, contract with the other party after incorporation. Since the
promoters will usually control the company at this stage, they should be able to ensure
that the company does make such a contract with the other party and so procure their
own release.
(d) Where the promoter is buying property for the company, he may take an option on it for,
say, three months. If the company, when it is formed, wishes to take over the property,
the promoter can assign the benefit of the option to the company or enforce the option
personally for the companyâ€™s benefit. If the company does not wish to take the property,
the promoter is not pe rsonally liable to take and pay for it, though he may lose the money
he agreed to pay for the option.
(e) It should also be noted that s 51 states that the promoter is personally liable â€˜subject
to any agreement to the contraryâ€™. Thus the promoter could agree when making the
contract that he should not be personally liable on it. (See the remarks of Lord Denning
in Phonogram Ltdv Lane, 1981.) This may not satisfy a third party who wants a form of
initial binding agreement but it is sanctioned by the 1985 Act.
Nevertheless, the general legal position is unsatisfactory and the Jenkins Committee on
Company Law Reform which reported in June 1962 (Cmnd 1749) recommended legislation
under which a company when formed could validly adopt a pre-incorporation contract by
unilateral act, and Clause 6 of the Companies Bill 1973, which never became law, permitted a
company after incorporation to ratify contracts which purported to have been made in its
name or on its behalf before incorporation without the consent of the other party involved.
At the present time such an act or ratification operates only as an offer to be bound which the
other party must accept if there is to be an enforceable contract.
Perhaps surprisingly there is no provision under the Companies Act 2006 for ratification
of a pre-incorporation contract by the company after its formation.

Incorporation
Natal Land and Colonization Cov Pauline Colliery and Development Syndicate
[1904] AC 120
Prior to incorporation, the P Company contracted to take an option to lease land belonging to
Mrs de Carrey if it was coal bearing. After incorporation, the company entered on the land and
made trial borings. The land was found to be coal bearing and the P company asked for a lease.
Mrs de Carrey had by then transferred her interest in the property to the N company and it would
not grant a lease. The P company sued at first instance for specific performance of the contract.
Held - the P company could not enforce the option because:
(a) its own conduct in merely boring did not unequivocally evidence an intention to take a lease;
(b) even if it had, it was merely an offer, and there was no evidence of acceptance either by
Mrs de Carrey or the N company.
Courts in the United States are more generous. They take the view that a contract made before
incorporation is an offer open for acceptance by the company. So any act done by the company
after incorporation which is unequivocally referable to the offer operates as an acceptance and not
an offer as in English company law.
Promoterâ€™s liability and the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999
It should be noted that the provisions of the above Act are no help to the promoter in avoiding liability on the pre-incorporation contract because, where third-party rights are given, in
this case to the company when formed, the original parties, of whom the promoter is one,
remain liable on the contract.
Incorporation
Application for registration is made by filing certain documents with the Registrar of
Companies. The main Registry is in Cardiff (Crown Way, Cardiff, CF14 3UZ) and further
information about Companies House, together with details of the procedure for registering
new companies, is available at: www.companieshouse.gov.uk. The documents to be filed are
as follows:
1 The memorandum of association must be delivered to the Registrar together with an application for registration and a statement of compliance.
The memorandum is a significantly abridged document when compared with the
former requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and previous company legislation (see
âž¨ See p. 79 Chapter 3 âž¨). Its function under the Companies Act 2006 is to evidence the intention
of the person or persons who subscribe to it that he/she/they have the intention to form a
company and to take at least one share each in the company. A company, even a public
company, can be registered with one member and, since the memorandum is reduced to a
formation document, it is no longer part of the companyâ€™s constitution (see s 17) and is no

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
longer subject to alteration, amendment or update. The memorandum must be in the
prescribed form and authenticated by each subscriber.
Note that there is no requirement for subscribers to a company to be domiciled in the
part of the UK in which the company is to be registered (Princess of Reussv Bos (1871) LR
5 HL 176). However, a business which is already completely constituted as a partnership
or a corporation under another legal system cannot be registered as a company under the
Companies Act 2006 (Bulkeleyv Schutz (1871) LR 3 PC 764).
2 The application for registration. According to s 9(2) this must state:
(a) the proposed name of the company;
(b) whether the registered office is to be situated in England and Wales (or in Wales) or in
Scotland or Northern Ireland;
(c) whether the liability of the members of the company is to be limited and, if so, whether
by shares or guarantee; and
(d) whether the company is to be public or private.
Where the company is being formed by an agent of the subscribers to the memorandum,
the application must contain his or her address (s 9(3)).
The required contents of the application for registration are outlined in s 9(4) and are
as follows:
(a) where the company is to have a share capital, a statement of capital and initial shareholdings;
(b) where the company is to be limited by guarantee, a statement of the guarantee;
(c) a statement of the proposed officers of the company;
(d) a statement of the intended address of the registered office;
(e) a copy of any company specific articles of association.
Where no articles are filed, or insofar as the company specific articles do not modify
or exclude them, the Companies Act 2006 Model Articles will apply as default articles. (See
Appendix 1 of this book for a copy of these provisions.)
The application, together with a statement of compliance, must be delivered to the
Registrar of Companies for England and Wales (if the registered office can be situated in
England or Wales, or solel y in Wales). The Registrars in Scotland and Northern Ireland deal
with registrations of companies in those jurisdictions.
A fee of Â£20 is payable for the registration of a company non-electronically and the process
normally takes 5 working days. For a fee of Â£50, the process may be undertaken on the same
day so long as the documents are presented before 3pm. A reduced fee of Â£15 is payable for
the electronic registration of a company.
Statement of capital and initial shareholdings
According to s 10 of the Companies Act 2006, this must state:
(a) The total number of shares in the company that are to be taken by those who are subscribers to the memorandum and the total nominal value of those shares taken together.
(b) For each class of shares, such particulars of the rights attached to them as the Secretary of
State may require and prescribe; the total number of shares of the class and the total nominal value of those shares taken together and the amount to be paid up and the amount,
if any, to be unpaid on each share, whether on account of the nominal value of the share
or by way of premium.

Incorporation
(c) The statement must contain such information as the Secretary of State may require
and prescribe to identify the subscribers to the memorandum. This need not be a home
address; a contact address will be sufficient (e.g. the office of the subscriberâ€™s solicitors or
accountants).
(d) In regard to each subscriber, the number, nominal value of each share, and the class of
share to be taken by the subscriber on formation, assuming there are different classes of
shares and the amount to be paid, or left unpaid, on the shares either on account of the
nominal value or premium for each class, where there are different classes of shares.
Statement of guarantee
Section 11 states that this must contain:
(a) A provision that each member undertakes that if the company is wound up whilst he or
she is a member, or within one year after ceasing to be a member, he or she will contribute to its assets such amount as may be required for the payment of the debts and
liabilities of the company contracted before he or she ceased to be a member, and the
costs, charges and expenses of winding up, as well as the adjustment of the rights of
members as between themselves not exceeding a specified amount.
(b) Information, as required by the Secretary of State, sufficient to identify the subscribers;
a contact address will be sufficient.
Statement of proposed officers
Under s 12 of the Companies Act 2006, this must contain details of the companyâ€™s proposed
officers/directors and secretary. This information must appear in the register of directors and
the register of secretaries which a company keeps. For example, for directors this is as follows:
(a) name and any former names;
(b) a service address (e.g. the companyâ€™s registered office);
(c) the country or state or part of the UK in which the director is usually resident;
(d) nationality;
(e) business occupation (if any);
(f) date of birth.
In addition, the usual residential address must be supplied for inclusion on the companyâ€™s
register of residential addresses and the Registrarâ€™s register of residential addresses, but these
are not open to inspection by the public, but only to certain groups (i.e. a police authority).
The above procedure in regard to residential addresses is to protect directors against such
things as violent demonstrations against them and their companies due to their line of business. The provisions apply to all directors now and also to company secretaries. This matter
âž¨ See p. 334 is further considered in Chapter 17 âž¨.
Statement of compliance
Section 13 deals with this. It is a statement that the requirements of the Act as regards
registration have been complied with. The Registrar may accept this as sufficient evidence
of compliance.

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
Registration
If the Registrar is satisfied that the requirements of the Act have been complied with, he will
register the documents and issue a certificate of incorporation (ss 14, 15), together with a registered number (s 1066).
The Registrar has no discretion in the matter. He must grant a certificate of incorporation
and, since the Registrar is here acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, the subscribers may enforce
registration through the courts by asking the court to order the Registrar to make the registration (Rv Registrar of Companies, ex parte Bowen[1914] 3 KB 1161).
Rv Registrar of Companies, ex parte Bowen[1914] 3 KB 1161
An application was submitted to register the following proposed company name: â€˜The United
Dental Service Ltdâ€™. The Registrar refused to register the company unless the memorandum was
amended so as to indicate that work should be undertaken only by registered dentists, or the name
of the company was amended so as to omit the word â€˜dentistâ€™. The applicants (seven unregistered
dental practitioners) sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Registrar to register the company.
Lord Reading CJ noted:
In my opinion the question turns in the main...upon whether the use of these words, â€˜The United
Dental Serviceâ€™, would amount to an offence under the Dentists Act 1878...I think these words,
â€˜United Dental Serviceâ€™, imply a description of the acts to be performed, and do not imply that the
persons who will perform them are persons specifically qualified under the statute of 1878. The
Registrar of Companies would be entitled, if the use of the proposed name would be an offence under
the statute, to refuse to register the company with that name; but, having arrived at the conclusion
that that would not be the effect of the use of the words, â€˜United Dental Serviceâ€™, I hold that the registrar was wrong in refusing registration upon that ground.
Held - The Registrarâ€™s refusal was unjustified.
However, the Registrar may refuse to register a company whose objects are unlawful. In Rv
Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, ex parte More[1931] 2 KB 197, Scrutton LJ noted:
This is a short point involving the construction of s 41 of the Lotteries Act, 1823. Two gentlemen proposed to sell tickets in England in connection with an Irish lottery. For some reason
they did not propose to do this themselves; they proposed to form a private company to do it.
It is merely conjecture on my part that this may be due to the fact that the provisions in the Act
of 1823 making offenders liable to be punished as rogues and vagabonds do not apply to a company, and so the two gentlemen intending to form this company wished in this way to avoid the
risk of being prosecuted under the Act. They accordingly lodged the memorandum and articles
of association of the proposed company with the Registrar of Companies, who, when he saw
that the object of the company was to sell tickets in a lottery known as the Irish Free State
Hospitals Sweepstake, refused to register the company. Thereupon an application was made to
the Court for a writ of mandamus directing the Registrar to register the company. To succeed
in that application the applicant must show that it is legal to sell in England tickets for the Irish
Free State Hospital Sweepstake authorised by an Act of the Irish Free State. The only Act which
can be supposed to authorise the selling in England is an Irish Act, but the Irish Parliament has
no jurisdiction in England, and that being so, the Irish Parliament cannot authorise lottery
tickets to be sold in England. The authority to sell in any place must be given by the Parliament
having jurisdiction in that place, and the Imperial Parliament has given no authority to sell
lottery tickets in England...The appeal must be dismissed.

Effect of incorporation
As to the effect of registration, the subscribers to the memorandum become members
of the company, which has a legal personality, and the persons named in the statement of
proposed officers (i.e. directors and secretary) are deemed appointed. The certificate is also
conclusive evidence that the registration requirements have been complied with so that the
valid and legal existence of the company cannot be challenged in court, even if in the event
they have not been (ss 15, 16).
Note, however, that the Registrarâ€™s decision to incorporate a company is subject to judicial
review, as per the case of Rv Registrar of Companies, ex parte AG [1991] BCLC 476 which
dealt with the attempted registration of a company to carry on the business of prostitution.
Electronic incorporation
Companies House has introduced a service whereby presenters who incorporate companies
regularly can conduct the process electronically. A citizensâ€™ incorporation service is not yet
available. There is a system of electronic authentication where documents are delivered electronically. This procedure for electronic incorporation is permitted under Schedules 4 and 5
to the Companies Act 2006.
Effect of incorporation
The issue of a certificate of incorporation incorporates the members of the company into a
persona at law (legal person), and limits their liability if the application for registration
requires this. This takes effect from the first moment of the date of incorporation stated on
the certificate (Jubilee Cotton Mills Ltdv Lewis [1924] AC 958). As we have seen, the certificate
of incorporation is conclusive evidence that all the requirements of the Companies Act as to
registration have been complied with, and if any irregularity had occurred in the registration
procedure, it would not be possible to attack the validity of the companyâ€™s incorporation.
The evidence which was available to prove the irregularity would not be admissible (Cotman
âž¨ See p. 85 v Brougham, 1918, see Chapter 3 âž¨). This means that all English companies registered under
the Act are companies de jure (as a matter of law). In the jurisdictions where this rule does
not apply, actions have been brought in the courts attacking the validity of a companyâ€™s
formation many years after incorporation. This cannot happen in England and Wales.
However, the certificate of incorporation is not conclusive evidence that all the companyâ€™s
business is legal; and if a company is registered with illegal or immoral business, the House of
Lords decided in Bowman v Secular Society [1917] AC 406 that the Crown could apply,
through the Attorney-General, for a quashing order to cancel the registration made by the
Registrar. In Attorney-General v Lindi St Claire (Personal Services) Ltd [1981] 2 Co Law
69 the High Court quashed a decision by the Registrar of Companies to register the business
of a prostitute as Lindi St Claire (Personal Services) Ltd. The name was registered in 1979
after the Registrar had rejected Miss St Claireâ€™s alternative titles, i.e. Prostitutes Ltd, Hookers
Ltd and Lindi St Claire French Lessons Ltd. Miss St Claireâ€™s accountants advised her to
register a company after receiving a letter from the Revenueâ€™s policy division stating that it
considered prostitution to be a trade. The Attorney-General contended that the company

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
should not have been registered because it was formed for sexually immoral purposes and
was consequently against public policy and illegal. The High Court agreed and the registration was quashed.
In addition, a company incorporated for unlawful purposes may be ordered by the court
to be wound up on the petition of a creditor or member, the ground for the petition being
that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up (Insolvency Act 1986,
s 122(1)(g)), or on the petition of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)
where it has appointed an inspector to investigate the companyâ€™s affairs and he has reported
adversely on the legality of the business for which it was formed.
From the date impressed upon the certificate the company becomes a body corporate with
perpetual succession, and with the right to exercise the powers given in its memorandum. The
companyâ€™s life dates from the first moment of the day of incorporation (Jubilee Cotton Mills
v Lewis, 1924, see below).
There is no statutory requirement that the certificate should be displayed at the registered
office or kept at any particular place.
Jubilee Cotton Millsv Lewis[1924] AC 958
Lewis was a promoter of a company formed to purchase a cotton mill and to carry on the
business of cotton spinning. The memorandum and articles of the company were accepted by the
Registrar of Companies on 6 January 1920, and the certificate of incorporation was dated on that
day. However, the certificate, it appeared, was not signed by the Registrar until 8 January 1920.
On 6 January a large number of fully paid shares were allotted to the vendors of the mill, and they
were later transferred to Lewis. The question of the validity of the allotment arose in this case, and
it was held that the certificate was conclusive as to the date on which the company was incorporated. A company is deemed to be incorporated from the day of the date on its certificate of
incorporation, and from the first moment of that day. Therefore, the allotment was not void on the
ground that it was made before the company came into existence.
Ready-made companies
It will be appreciated that where a ready-made company is used the registration procedures
will have been gone through. Indeed, it has been estimated that approximately 60 per cent of
company registrations are undertaken via the â€˜shelf companyâ€™ route (see: Company Law
Review Steering Group, Modern Company Law for a Competitive Economy: Developing the
Framework, URN 00/656, London: DTI, 2000). Such companies are also relatively economic
to purchase, usually being around Â£50 in price and simple to acquire.
Once purchased, the promoters may wish to change the ready-made companyâ€™s name and
will have to appoint directors and a secretary and notify these appointments to the Registrar.
The ready-made company will have had directors and a secretary on formation but these persons will have resigned on the purchase of the ready-made company.
The notification of the new directors and secretary is under s 167 as changes in the directorate and secretariat since they are replacements and not original appointments.

Post-incorporation procedures for re-registration
Publicity in connection with incorporation
The Registrar is required to publish in the London Gazette:
(a) the issue of any certificate of incorporation (but there is in fact no statutory requirement
to display the certificate at the registered office, though it is often so displayed);
(b) any report as to the value of a non-cash asset under s 597 where a non-cash asset has been
acquired from a subscriber.
Post-incorporation procedures for re-registration
Conversion of companies from private to public (ss 90-96)
A private company may be re-registered as a public company if not previously re-registered
as an unlimited company if:
(a) the members pass a special or written special resolution which alters the companyâ€™s
articles so that they fit the statutory requirements of a public company. The name must
be changed on conversion to reflect the fact that the company will be a public company.
Companies House will only permit a change to the suffix plc under the re-registration
procedure. If any other change in the name is required, the members must pass a special
resolution (which may be in written form) and file the resolution with the re-registration
documents with the relevant name change fee. The re-registration certificate will carry
the new name;
(b) the requirements as regards share capital are met. This means that the nominal value
of the allotted share capital is not less than Â£50,000 and in respect of all the shares, or
as many as are needed to make up the authorised minimum, the following conditions
are satisfied:
(i) no less than one-quarter of the nominal value of each share and the whole of any
premium on it is paid up;
(ii) none of the shares has been fully or partly paid up by means of an undertaking to do
work or perform services where this has not already been performed or otherwise
discharged; and
(iii) where any share has been allotted as fully or partly paid up for a non-cash consideration which consists solely or partly of an undertaking to do something other than
to perform services, i.e. usually an undertaking to transfer a non-cash asset, either
the undertaking has been performed or otherwise discharged or there is a contract
between the company and the person involved under which the undertaking must
be performed within five years.
Shares allotted under an employeesâ€™ share scheme which are not one-quarter paid up
can be disregarded for the purpose of deciding whether the above requirements have
(c) an application for the change is made to the Registrar accompanied by a statement of
compliance;

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
(d) the application is accompanied by the following documents:
(i) a printed copy of the articles as altered and added to by the special or written resolution and a copy of the resolution unless already forwarded to the Registrar;
(ii) a copy of a balance sheet prepared as at a date not more than seven months before
the date of the application, but not necessarily in respect of an accounting reference
period. The balance sheet must be accompanied by a copy of an unqualified report
of the companyâ€™s auditor in relation to the balance sheet. If there is a qualification,
the auditor must state in writing that it is not material in determining whether at the
date of the balance sheet the companyâ€™s net assets were at least equal to the sum of
its called-up capital and non-distributable reserves, such as its share premium
account and capital redemption reserve;
(iii) a copy of a written statement by the companyâ€™s auditors that in their opinion the
balance sheet referred to in (ii) above shows that the amount of the companyâ€™s net
assets at the date of the balance sheet was not less than the aggregate of its called-up
share capital and non-distributable reserves;
(iv) the statement of compliance that: (a) the requirements in regard to the making
of necessary changes in the companyâ€™s constitution have been complied with; and
that (b) between the balance sheet date and the application for re-registration there
has been no change in the financial position of the company which has caused
the net assets to become less than the aggregate of called-up share capital plus nondistributable reserves.
It should be noted that audit exemption regulations do not dispense with the requirement of
an audit report on the balance sheet. This means that small companies can exempt themselves
from the requirement to appoint an auditor unless and until it becomes necessary to do so for
certain purposes other than the audit of financial statements. Re-registration is one of those
purposes. Other areas where an auditor is required will be picked up as they occur.
Statement of proposed secretary
This is a s 95 requiremen t which arises as a result of the abolition of the requirement for
private companies to have a company secretary. On re-registration as a public company, and
on the assumption that the company does not have a secretary, details of the person or persons who will act as secretary or joint secretaries must be given together with consent to act.
Where, for example, a firm acts, consent can be given by one partner on behalf of the others.
Additional requirements relating to share capital
If between the date of the balance sheet and the passing of a special (or written) resolution to
convert to a public company the company has allotted shares which are wholly or partly paid
for by a non-cash consideration, then it shall not make an application for re-registration
unless before application is made:
(a) the consideration has been valued in accordance with s 593 (i.e. by a person or persons
who are qualified by law to audit a public companyâ€™s accounts who may themselves
appoint other suitable persons to assist them);
(b) a report regarding the value has been made to the company by the persons referred to in
(a) above during the six months immediately preceding the allotment of the shares.

Post-incorporation procedures for re-registration
If the Registrar is satisfied with the application for re-registration and provided that there
is not in existence any court order reducing the companyâ€™s share capital below the authorised
minimum, he will, on payment of a fee, retain the documents which have been sent to him
and issue a certificate of incorporation stating that the company is a public company.
The company then becomes a public company and the alterations in its constitution take
effect. The certificate of incorporation is conclusive evidence that the re-registration requirements have been complied with and that the company is a public company.
Conversion of companies from public to private:
generally (ss 97-101)
This is permitted and the procedure is as follows:
(a) the members must pass a special resolution altering the memorandum so that it no longer
states that the company is a public company and also in terms of the name. The provisions regarding change of suffix from â€˜plcâ€™ to â€˜Ltdâ€™ and any further name change are with
the necessary changes the same as those set out above for private to public conversion;
(b) application is then made on the prescribed forms accompanied by a statement of compliance. The application is delivered to the Registrar together with a copy of the articles
as altered or added to by the special resolution and the resolution to re-register.
It should be noted that because this type of conversion may well result in the loss of a
market (i.e. a listing or quotation on the Stock Exchange) in which to sell the shares there are as
regards the special resolution dissentient rights. Within a period of 28 days after the passing
of the resolution dissentient holders of at least 5 per cent in nominal value of the companyâ€™s
issued share capital or any class thereof, or not less than 50 members, may apply to the court
to have the resolution cancelled and the court may cancel or affirm it. If there is no application to the court or if it is unsuccessful and the court affirms the special resolution, the
Registrar will issue a new certificate of incorporation as a private company.
It should also be noted that the court may, in addition, adjourn the proceedings brought
by dissentients in order that satisfactory arrangements may be made for the purchase of the
shares of those dissentients. The purchase may obviously be by other shareholders but the
companyâ€™s money may also be used for this purpose and if this is the intention the court will
make the necessary order to provide for the purchase by the company of its own shares and
to reduce its share capital. The order may also make any necessary alterations in or additions
to the articles of the company.
Conversion of companies from public to private:
reduction of share capital
If the court reduces the share capital of a public company to below Â£50,000, it must
re-register as a private company. To speed up this process the court may authorise reregistration without the company having followed the above procedures and the court order
may specify and make the necessary changes in the companyâ€™s constitution. Thus, a reduction
of capital may now have the further consequence of changing the companyâ€™s status from
public to private.

Chapter 2 Promotion and incorporation
Conversion of private limited company to private unlimited company
(ss 102-104)
A company limited by shares or by guarantee may be re-registered as an unlimited company.
However, no public company may apply to be re-registered as an unlimited company
because a public company cannot be an unlimited company and therefore such a conversion
involves a reduction in status from public to private. A public company which wishes to reregister as unlimited must use the procedure laid down in the 1985 Act for conversion of a
public company to a private company.
If, however, the company is private, all the members must consent in writing and if this
can be achieved there must be sent to the Registrar of Companies a statement of compliance
that all the members of the company have consented together with a copy of the articles as
altered. The Registrar will then issue a new certificate of incorporation which is conclusive
evidence that the conversion is in all respects valid. In addition, the Registrar must publish
the issue of the new certificate in the London Gazette. There can be no conversion back to a
limited company. In addition, a company is excluded from re-registering as unlimited if it
has previously re-registered as limited.
As we have seen, unlimited companies do not in general have to file accounts and reregistration back and forth between limited and unlimited status is not allowed in order to
prevent selective filing of accounts, e.g. by re-registration as unlimited in a year in which the
directors did not wish to file accounts and then back to limited status subsequently.
Conversion of private unlimited company to private limited company
(ss 105-108)
It is also possible to re-register an unlimited company as a limited one but, as we have
seen, this does not apply to a company which was previously a limited company but has reregistered as an unlimited one. If the conversion is to a private limited company, the conversion must be authorised by special or written resolution of the members. Following this
a copy of the articles as altered and a statement of compliance are sent to the Registrar who
will issue a new certificate of incorporation which is conclusive evidence that the conversion
is in all respects valid. The Registrar will also advertise the issue of the new certificate in the
London Gazette.
If an unlimited company wishes to re-register as a public company which is by definition
a company limited by shares, the procedure to be followed is that for the re-registration of a
private company as a public company except that the special resolution to convert must
include two additional matters as follows:
(a) it must state that the liability of the members is to be limited by shares and what the share
capital of the company is to be; and
(b) it must make such alterations in the companyâ€™s constitution as are necessary to bring it
in substance and in form into conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act in
regard to a public company limited by shares. This involves, for example, changes in the
companyâ€™s name and capital.
The re-registration as a public company is not available to unlimited companies which
have re-registered as such having been previously limited companies.
The effect on the liability of members of such a conversion is that those who become members after conversion are liable only to the extent of capital unpaid on their shares. Those who

Essay questions
were members at the date of the conversion, and are still members at the date of winding-up,
are fully liable for debts and liabilities incurred before conversion. Those who were members
at the date of conversion but have transferred their shares after conversion and before windingup are liable for debts and liabilities incurred before conversion up to three years after it took
place (Insolvency Act 1986, s 77(2)).

The constitution of the company -
the memorandum of association

Company names
Under the Companies Act 1985, the constitution of a registered company consisted of
two documents called the memorandum of association and the articles of association.
However, this situation has been changed under s 17 of the Companies Act 2006, which now
states that a companyâ€™s constitution consists of the articles of association and any resolutions
and agreements to which Chapter 3 (of the 2006 Act) applies.
The memorandum is still required for registration under s 9 of the Companies Act 2006,
but is reduced significantly in its role, complexity and length. According to s 8, the document
simply states the intention of the subscribers to form a company and to be members of the
company on formation as well as to take at least one share each in the company (if limited by
shares). The memorandum must be in the prescribed form and authenticated by each subscriber (s 8(2)).
For existing companies, s 28(1) states that provisions within the memorandum which
fall outside those envisaged by the Companies Act 2006, will be treated as provisions of the
articles. In other words, these provisions will still form part of the companyâ€™s constitution
as defined by s 17.
In line with this approach, the objects clause (formally one of the fundamental elements of
a companyâ€™s memorandum) has now been relocated to the articles of association. In addition,
s 33(1) of the Companies Act 2006 provides that the objects of a company are unrestricted
unless the articles specifically restrict them. This is regarded by many as a considerable step
forward in the area. In the past, many companies were wary of the doctrine of ultra vires(discussed later) and as such their objects clauses were extremely long affairs, despite attempts to
simplify the area (i.e. s 3A of the Companies Act 1985 permitted a company â€˜to carry on business as a general commercial companyâ€™).
The remainder of this chapter will cover those issues which until the new Companies Act
were traditionally contained within the memorandum of a company.
Company names
Section 9(2)(a) requires the application for registration to include the companyâ€™s proposed
name. Furthermore, s 82 states that the Secretary of State has power to require companies to
give appropriate publicity to their names thereafter at their places of business as well as on
business correspondence and related documentation.
A companyâ€™s choice of name is subject to a number of limitations. First of all, ss 58 and 59
state that if the company is a limited company, then its name must end with the prescribed
warning suffix â€˜limitedâ€™/â€˜Ltdâ€™ (if it is a private company) or â€˜public limited companyâ€™/â€˜plcâ€™
(if it is a public company). This requirement is subject to limited exemptions outlined in s 60
(i.e. if the private company is a charity). The purpose of this requirement is to act as a warning to anyone dealing with the company that it is an entity which has limited liability (though
many feel that this is a little outdated and not very effective in practice).
In addition, under s 53, there are certain prohibited names which limit a companyâ€™s choice.
These include anything that is regarded offensive or which, in the opinion of the Secretary
of State, would constitute an offence. This category of restriction will not often be met with
in business but the Registrar turned down the names â€˜Prostitutes Ltdâ€™, â€˜Hookers Ltdâ€™ and
â€˜Lindi St Claire French Lessons Ltdâ€™ when application was made for the registration of the

Chapter 3 The constitution of the company - the memorandum of association
business of a prostitute (Attorney-Generalv Lindi St Claire (Personal Services) Ltd [1981] 2
Co Law 69).
Furthermore, s 54(1) states that the approval of the Secretary of State is required for the
use of a name that would be likely to give the impression that the company is connected with
Her Majestyâ€™s Government, a local authority, or any public authority. Equally, the name of a
company must not include indications of company type or legal form (i.e. public limited
company) except in accordance with the requirements outlined above (s 65).
Finally, and probably most importantly, the proposed name of a company must not be the
same as any name that already exists on the Registrarâ€™s index of names (s 66). This may appear
easily avoidable, but when one considers the fact that there are currently over 2 million names
on the Registrarâ€™s index, then the process becomes a little more complicated, especially when
one considers the possibility for â€˜passing offâ€™. Once again, a limited exception has been introduced by way of s 66(4) for groups of companies.
Where the approval of the Secretary of State is required, the necessary evidence must be
submitted with the incorporation documents or with the relevant resolution on a change of
name. Where the approval of a particular body or organisation is required, a statement that
an approach to that body or organisation has been made, together with a copy of any response
received, must be included. This would be the case where the word â€˜charityâ€™ was to be used
and the Charity Commissioners had been approached.
Once a suitable name has been decided upon though, the company may progress the
process of registration. However, a final word of caution must be noted. Even if the company successfully registers its chosen name, the Secretary of State may, within 12 months
of registration, direct a change because a name has been registered which is the same or
too like that of an existing company. This permits an existing company to pursue a more
cost effective mode of challenging a newly registered company name that is causing confusion, than that of a â€˜passing offâ€™ action. If the Secretary of State so directs a company to
change its name then non-compliance is a criminal offence on the part of the company
and every officer in default. Once that time has passed and the existence of a company with
a â€˜too likeâ€™ name has not been discovered by the first company to have the name, then the
first company is left with the only other remedy, i.e. to seek redress at common law in the
law of tort.
A company or other business organisation which carries on or proposes to carry on
business under a name calculated to deceive the public by confusion with the name of
an existing concern commits the civil wrong (or tort) of passing off, and will be restrained
by injunction from doing so from the moment of incorporation. Consequently, in the
case of Tussaud v Tussaud (1890) 44 ChD 678, the court granted an injunction in favour
of the company which owed Madame Tussaudâ€™s waxworks so as to prevent a member
of the Tussaud family from carrying on a similar waxworks show under the name of
â€˜Louis Tussaud Ltdâ€™. Where the offending business is a proposed company, an injunction
can be obtained to prevent registration, if information is available in time. If an injunction is made against an existing company for passing off, it must either change its name
or its business or wind up. In addition, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the deception was intentional (British Diabetic Association v Diabetic Society Ltd [1995] 4 All ER
It has already been noted that the mere fact of using oneâ€™s own name in business will not
necessarily prevent a successful passing-off claim by an organisation already in business under
that name (Asprey & Garrard LtdvWRA (Guns) Ltd(2001).

Company names
La SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme des Anciens Etablissements Panhard et Lavassorv
Panhard Levassor Motor Co Ltd[1901] 2 Ch 513
In this case, which we can call the Panhardcase, the claimant was a French company and its cars
were sold in England. The French company wished to set up an English company to act as an
agent in England to improve the sales of its cars there. To try to stop this the defendant English
company was registered, its promoters hoping that the French company would not be able to
register its name for its English corporate agent, there being a company of â€˜too likeâ€™ name on the
register already, and that this would prevent increased competition in the car market. It was held
that the members of the English company must change the name of their company or wind it up
or the company would be taken off the register.
To constitute the tort of passing off the business carried on by the offending concern must
be the same as that of the claimant, or it must be likely that custom will come to the offending concern because the public will be deceived and associate it with the claimant. An interesting contrast is provided by the following cases.
Ewingv Buttercup Margarine Company Ltd[1917] 2 Ch 1
The claimant had since 1904 been carrying on a business dealing in margarine and tea, and had
upwards of 150 shops of his own selling 50 tons of margarine a week in all. The claimantâ€™s concern was called â€˜The Buttercup Dairy Coâ€™. The claimantâ€™s shops were situated in Scotland and in
the North of England, but he was planning to expand his business into the South of England. The
defendant company was registered in November 1916, and as soon as the claimant heard about
it, he complained to the management of the concern, and later brought this action for an injunction to prevent the defendant company from trading in that name. It appeared that although the
defendant was in the business of selling margarine, it was a wholesaler, whereas the claimant was
a retailer, and the defendant put this forward as a defence suggesting that there would be no confusion. Another defence was that the company would operate only around London and there would
be no confusion with a Northern concern.
Held- by the Court of Ap peal - that an injunction would be granted to the claimant restraining the
defendant company from trading in that name. Although the defendant was at the moment a
wholesaler, the objects clause of the memorandum did give power to retail which it might exercise
in future. Further, the claimant intended to open up branches in the South of England where there
would be confusion.
Aerators Ltdv Tollitt[1902] 2 Ch 319
The claimant company was formed to work a patent for the instantaneous aeration of liquids. The
defendants were the subscribers of the memorandum and articles of a proposed new company to
be called Automatic Aerator Patents Ltd. The claimant sought an injunction to restrain the defendants from registering that name because it would deceive the public, the word â€˜Aeratorâ€™ being
associated with the claimant company. The claimantâ€™s patent was a portable aerator for use in
siphons, whereas the defendantsâ€™ company was concerned with large installations in public
houses where a large amount of aeration of beer was required.
Held - there was no evidence of the probability of deception, and an injunction would not be
granted. The action was an attempt to monopolise a word in ordinary use and must be dismissed.

Chapter 3 The constitution of the company - the memorandum of association
As a general rule, an injunction will not be granted where the offending concern is trading
in the name of its proprietor though where a company is trading in a name which is merely
that of one only of its members then an injunction will be granted if confusion with an existing concern is likely to result (MP Guimaraens and Sonv Fonseca and Vosconcellos Ltd (1921)
38 RPC 388). Neither will an injunction be granted where a company uses a name which consists of that of the person from whom the company bought its business, even though confusion results.
Waring and Gillow Ltdv Gillow and Gillow Ltd(1916) 32 TLR 389
W and G Ltd, well-known furniture, carpet and rug dealers and auctioneers, sought an injunction restraining G and G Ltd from carrying on a business as auctioneers of carpets (formerly the
business belonged to L C Gillow, an auctioneer, who continued to be actively concerned with
the business).
The court held that on the facts the two businesses were not likely to be taken one for the other
and the injunction sought was not granted. In addition, since L C Gillow was actively concerned
with the business, the company was allowed to incorporate his name. Furthermore, since the
defendant company had purchased the business from L C Gillow, it was allowed to use his name
in order to take advantage of the goodwill purchased.
There is no similar protection for a first name or nickname. In Biba Group Ltd v Biba Boutique
[1980] RPC 413 the defendant whose surname was Gill had been known since infancy by the
nickname â€˜Bibaâ€™ and she ran a boutique in that name. The claimants, who were in a similar line of
business, obtained an injunction against her. Whitford J said that whatever the right of a person to
use his own surname, it did not extend to the use of a first name or nickname.
It should be noted that only the members can change a companyâ€™s name. The Court of Appeal
has considered whether the court has jurisdiction to order and empower the Registrar of
Companies to change the name of the company as it appears on the register in a situation
where no special resolution of its members to that effect has been passed. The Court of Appeal
ruled that there is no such jurisdiction.
Halifax plcv Halifax Repossessions Ltd[2004] 2 BCLC 455, CA
The claimants had brought proceedings against the defendants for infringement of trade mark and
passing off and the court granted relief in terms preventing the defendant group companies from
using the word â€˜Halifaxâ€™ in their names. However, there was no change of name. The claimants
then sought a court order under the Civil Procedure Rules to order the Registrar to change the
names to any name not including â€˜Halifaxâ€™. Two such orders were made but not acted upon by the
Registrar. In the Court of Appeal it was decided that the relevant rule did not give the court jurisdiction to make such a change in the absence of a special resolution of the members. The Companies
Act scheme for change must be followed. There were serious consequences to a change of company name. Signing company cheques where the companyâ€™s name was not properly stated could
result in personal liability in the signer. There were penalties for failing to display the proper name
on places of business and on stationery and so on. The Registrar could not effectively be required
to go beyond her statutory functions. She could not become involved in private litigation.

The objects clause
Finally, according to s 77 of the Companies Act 2006, a company may change its name by special resolution (see s 78) or by other means provided for by the companyâ€™s articles (see s 79).
On a change of name, the company must notify the Registrar who will enter the new name on
the register in place of the old one and issue an amended certificate of incorporation (s 80).
Notification must be accompanied by either a copy of the resolution (s 78(1)) or a statement
that the change of name has been made by means provided for by the companyâ€™s articles
(s 79(1)).
A change of name has effect from the date on which the new certificate of incorporation is
issued (s 81(1)), though one should also bear in mind some of the more practical implications
of such a change; the cost of changing letterheads and signs and, more generally, the way in
which customers, suppliers and bankers are to be informed. Equally, it should be stressed that
a change of name does not impact on the companyâ€™s rights or obligations. In other words, the
company which has an altered name and altered certificate of incorporation is still the same
company as when it was first registered under its previous name; it is not reformed at the
point of the change of name taking effect (Oshkosh Bâ€™Gosh Incv Dan Marbel Inc Ltd [1989]
BCLC 507).
The objects clause
The objects clause lists the things which the company can do (i.e. the capacity of the company).
If it enters into a transaction which is not included in the clause, that transaction will, at least
at common law, be ultra vires(that is, beyond its powers) and void (that is, of no effect).
It should be noted that what we are looking at in this chapter is the companyâ€™s capacity as
revealed by the objects clause of its memorandum. It will be discovered that even where the
company has capacity a transaction made on its behalf may still not be enforceable against it
because the agent who made it had no authority to do so. The problems presented by lack of
âž¨ See p. 129 authority in the agent are looked at in Chapter 6 âž¨ but the reader should, even at this early stage,
bear in mind the distinc tion between the two areas of company capacity and agent authority.
The leading case on the operation of the ultra viresrule at common law appears below.
Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Cov Riche(1875) LR 7 HL 653
The company bought a concession for the construction of a railway system in Belgium, and entered
into an agreement to finance Messrs Riche to construct a railway line. Messrs Riche commenced
the work, and the company paid over certain sums of money in connection with the contract. The
company later ran into difficulties, and the shareholders wished the directors to take over the contract in a personal capacity, and indemnify the shareholders. The directors thereupon repudiated
the contract on behalf of the company, and Messrs Riche sued for breach of contract. The case
turned on whether the company was engaged in an ultra viresactivity in financing the building of
a complete railway system because, if so, the contract it had made with Messrs Riche would be
ultra viresand void, and the claim against the company would fail. The objects clause of the companyâ€™s memorandum stated that it was established: â€˜to make or sell or lend on hire railway carriages,
wagons and all kinds of railway plant, fittings, machinery and rolling stock; to carry on the business of mechanical engineers and general contractors, to purchase and sell as merchants timber,
coal, metal and other materials, and to buy and sell such materials on commission or as agentsâ€™.

Chapter 3 The constitution of the company - the memorandum of association
Held - by the House of Lords - that the financing of the concession to build a complete railway
system from Antwerp to Tournai was ultra viresand void because it was not within the objects of
the company. The words empowering the company to carry on the business of general contracting must be construed ejusdem generiswith the preceding words, and must therefore be restricted
to contracting in the field of plant, fittings and machinery only. In other words, the company could
use its funds to make things for railways, but not make railways as such. The contract with Messrs
Riche was therefore void, and the directors were entitled to repudiate it.
The company should not carry out acts or enter into transactions which are beyond the
companyâ€™s objects clause and a shareholder, upon discovering the intention of the companyâ€™s
directors to enter into such an agreement, may obtain an injunction so as to prevent it from
going ahead (though not if it has already been ratified by way of special resolution of the
general meeting).
However, it should be noted that if the transaction has already been carried out, the shareholder may only seek to gain damages from the wrong-doer directors for the company. (It is
also worth pointing out at this stage that if a director has exceeded his/her powers then this
may be taken as a breach of the terms of his/her contract of employment as well as a breach
of his/her directorsâ€™ duties; s 171 imposes a duty on directors to abide by the companyâ€™s constitution. This will be discussed later within the context of directorsâ€™ duties.)
It is also worth noting that the reader should be aware of the distinction to be made
between a transaction undertaken by the directors which beyond the capacity of the company (i.e. ultra viresthe companyâ€™s objects clause) but which is rather an abuse of power by
the directors: Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltdv British Steel Corporation.
Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltdv British Steel Corporation
[1985] 2 WLR 908
A Mr Shenkman was a 51 per cent shareholder and director in Rolled Steel and held all the issued
share capital in another company called Scottish Steel of which he was also a director. Scottish
Steel owed a lot of money to Colville Ltd (a company controlled by the defendant company, British
Steel Corporation) and Mr Shenkman had given his personal guarantee of that debt. Later BSC
wanted more security and Mr S caused Rolled Steel to enter into a guarantee of the Scottish Steel
debt. There was no benefit to Rolled Steel in this and BSC knew there was not. Rolled Steel went
into liquidation as did Scottish Steel, and the court was asked to decide whether BSC could prove
in the liquidation of Rolled Steel on the guarantee.
Eventually the Court of Appeal decided that it could not. Slade LJ stated:
The relevant transactions were not beyond the corporate capacity of the plaintiff and thus were not
ultra viresin the proper sense of that phrase. However, the entering into the guarantee and, to the
extent of the sum guaranteed, the debenture was beyond the authority of the directors, because they
were entered into in furtherance of purposes not authorised by the plaintiffâ€™s memorandum. Despite
this lack of authority, they might have been capable of conferring rights on Colvilles if Colvilles had
not known of this lack of authority. Colvilles, however, did have such knowledge and so acquired no
rights under these transactions.
The transaction was not ultra vires Rolled Steel because its objects clause contained a paragraph
giving an express power to enter into guarantees. Rolled Steel also had an independent objects
paragraph on the lines of that in the Cotmancase, so the giving of guarantees was, in effect, an
object of the company which it could exercise whether there was a benefit or not.

The objects clause
Understanding the modern objects clause
By way of explanation of the above decision, it should be said that the ultra viresrule of the
common law was brought in by the courts to protect shareholders. It was thought that if a
shareholder bought shares in a company which had as its main object publishing and allied
activities, he would not want the directors of that company to start up a different kind of business because he wanted to put money in publishing.
In more recent times it has been realised that shareholders are not so fussy about the business the directors take the company into so long as it is ethical and makes profits from which
to pay dividends and the price of the companyâ€™s shares rises on the Stock Exchange as a result
of its success.
The people most affected by the ultra viresrule of the common law in more recent times
were creditors who had supplied goods or services to a company for a purpose not contained
in its objects clause. If the company was solvent, no doubt such creditors would be paid,
but if it went into insolvent liquidation, they would not even be able to put in a claim. The
liquidator would reject it as being based on a void transaction. Other creditors might get paid
some part of their debts if the company had some funds but the ultra vires creditors would
get nothing.
For this reason it became, and has remained until the Companies Act 2006, usual to put in
the objects clause a large number of objects and powers so that the company could do a wide
variety of things apart from its main business, if at any time it wished to do so. It also became
common to insert a paragraph in the objects clause which stated that each clause contains a
separate and independent main object which can be carried on separately from the others.
The House of Lords decided in Cotman vBrougham[1918] AC 514 that this type of clause
was legal so that, for example, a company whose main object was publishing could use a clause
giving investment powers for any kind of investment and not just investment in publishing.
Also, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Bell Houses Ltd v City Wall Properties Ltd
[1966] 2 All ER 674 is to the effect that a subjective objects clause can be drafted in such a way
as to allow the company to carry on any additional business, not provided for in the objects
clause, which the directors think can be conveniently pursued by the company. If this is
thought to put too much power in the hands of the directors, the objects clause may make the
decision depend upon an ordinary resolution of the members.
In this way the limitations which are placed by the common law on a companyâ€™s business
activities by the ultra viresrule were much reduced. In fact, with a large number of clauses in
the objects clause, with an independent objects subclause and/or a type of Bell Housesclause,
the modern companyâ€™s contractual capacity approached that of a natural person prior to the
new Act, with the ultra viresrule as a method of controlling the activities of the board of directors being largely abandoned for quite a long time.
The Companies Act 2006
In an attempt to simplify further this area, the Company Law Review Steering Groups
proposed the repeal of s 3A of the Companies Act 1985, together with the removal of the
objects clause from a companyâ€™s memorandum and insertion into the articles of association.
Indeed, the Companies Act 2006 goes further than this and states that unless a companyâ€™s
articles specifically restrict its objects, then according to s 31(1) its objects are unrestricted.
Consequently, for companies formed under the new Act, they are not required to have

Chapter 3 The constitution of the company - the memorandum of association
an objects clause and the doctrine of ultra vires (as outlined above) should be irrelevant to
their operation.
However, for a company that decides to adopt an objects clause so as to limit the capacity
of the company, then the doctrine of ultra vireswill still remain relevant internally (i.e. with
respect to deciding whether its directors have exceeded their powers and entered into a transaction that is ultra viresthe companyâ€™s objects clause).
It is also worth noting at this point that s 28(1) of the Companies Act 2006 provides that
provisions within the memorandum of existing companies (i.e. formed before the new Act
came into force) which fall outside those envisaged by the new Act, will be treated as provisions of the articles. In other words, provisions such as their objects clauses will still form part
of the companyâ€™s constitution as defined by s 17 and as such will be subject to the limitations
outlined in the preceding paragraph.
The capacity of the company remains much the same as it did under s 35 of the Companies
Act 1985 (as inserted by the Companies Act 1989), and is contained in s 39 of the Companies
Act 2006. The intention of this provision was to eliminate the effect of the ultra viresrule on
the claims of creditors, though it has less of an impact today than it would have had in the
past since, as we have seen, fewer transactions are likely to be ultra vires at common law.
However, on the assumption that the narrow scope of a particular companyâ€™s objects clause
may still allow for this, a review of certain of the statutory provisions appears below.
We shall deal at this stage only with the effect of legislation upon the rules relating to the
companyâ€™s capacity. It should also be borne in mind that legislation only reforms the ultra
viresrule - it has not been abolished, though so far as trade creditors of a company are concerned little should now be heard of it. There is a continuing relevance of the rule in other
areas as we shall see.
(a) The companyâ€™s capacity
Section 39 provides that the validity of an act of a company shall not be called into question
on the ground of lack of capacity by reason of anything in the companyâ€™s constitution. Section
40(1) goes on to state that â€˜in favour of a person dealing with a company in good faith, the
power of the directors to bind the company, or authorize others to do so, is deemed to be free
of any limitation under the companyâ€™s constitutionâ€™.
Thus, in the Ashbury case the contents of the objects clause only allowed the company
to make things for railways and not railways as such. The contract with Messrs Riche should
now have been enforceable against the company, since so far as outsiders are concerned, the
contents of (what is in) the constitution do not affect the validity of the transaction in terms
of the companyâ€™s capacity to enter into it.
(b) The rights of members
As noted above, under the common law any member may ask the court for an injunction to
prevent the directors from making (or continuing with) an ultra virestransaction, subject to
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Indeed, s 40(4) states that this provision â€˜does not
affect any right of a member of the company to bring proceedings to restrain the doing of an
action that is beyond the powers of the directorsâ€™. Section 40(5) goes on to state that it does
not affect any liability incurred by the directors by reason of them exceeding their powers.
However, given the fact that no objects clause is now required for private companies, this
process should, in the future, become of less importance; though existing companies will still
need to be wary of this possibility.

(c) Special regime for charities
Obviously charities need to be dealt with separately because people give not to the charity as
such but rather to the objects of that particular charity. Consequently, under s 42 of the
Companies Act 2006, ss 39 and 40 do not apply to the acts of a company that is a charity
unless a person:
(a) does not know at the time the act is done that the company is a charity; or
(b) gives full consideration in money or moneyâ€™s worth in relation to the act in question and
does not know that (i) the act is beyond the companyâ€™s constitution, or (ii) the act is
beyond the powers of the directors.
Altering the objects clause
The movement of the objects clause to a companyâ€™s articles of association means that this
provision may be changed in the same way as any other provision within the articles which
have not been the subject of entrenchment (see s 22), and can be freely changed, or amended,
under s 21 by way of a special resolution.
On an application for registration, s 9(4) requires a statement of capital and initial shareholdings if the company is to be limited by shares. Section 10(2) goes on to provide that the
statement of capital and initial shareholdings must state:
(a) the total number of shares of the company to be taken on formation by the subscribers
to the memorandum of association;
(b) the aggregate nominal value of those shares;
(c) for each class of shares: (i) prescribed particulars of the rights attached to the shares;
(ii) the total number of shares of that class; and (iii) the aggregate nominal value of shares
of that class; and
(d) the amount to be paid up and the amount (if any) to be unpaid on each share (whether
on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium).
On registration this information will usually be very simple. In the case of a shelf company,
this information will generally consist of two people taking one Â£1 share each, upon which
nothing is paid. However, once a company is in the process of issuing larger, more significant
numbers of shares, this information must be provided to the Registrar of Companies via
a â€˜return of allotmentsâ€™. In this regard, s 555(2) provides that within one month of making
an allotment of shares, the company must deliver a return of allotment to the Registrar for
registration. This return must be accompanied by a statement of capital (s 555(3)(b)) which
must according to s 555(4) contain an updated version of the information required under s
10(2) discussed above.
One significant development under the Companies Act 2006 is that it has removed the
notion of â€˜authorised capitalâ€™ which had increasingly become regarded as a somewhat outdated and irrelevant concept in practice. Indeed, as will be noted in subsequent chapters, this
concept could pose problems for the directors of a company in that, once shares had been
issued up to the amount of the companyâ€™s authorised share capital, they were obliged to go

Chapter 3 The constitution of the company - the memorandum of association
back to the shareholders so as to gain approval to increase the authorised amount (see s 121
of the Companies Act 1985). In one sense, this provided shareholders with a certain amount
of protection from having their holdings diluted. However, since the Companies Act 2006 has
introduced shareholder control of share-related matters into other sections of its provisions
and, with a number of the provisions formerly located in the memorandum now being included
into the companyâ€™s articles, this opens up possibilities for shareholders to place stronger controls in the companyâ€™s constitution to the alteration of capital rather than via concepts such
as â€˜authorised capitalâ€™ as in the past.
The registered office
Section 9(2)(b) requires that on application to be registered, a company must state in which
of the three United Kingdom jurisdictions its registered office will be located. If it is to be in
England and Wales or Wales, then registration is effected by the Registrar of Companies
in London, and if in Scotland, by the Scottish Registrar of Companies in Edinburgh. The
situation of the registered office in England and Wales or Wales or Scotland fixes the
companyâ€™s nationality as British and its domicile as English or Scottish, as the case may be
(but see Daimler Co Ltd vContinental Tyre & Rubber Co Ltd, 1916), though not its residence.
Therefore, the legal system under which a company is incorporated is its domicile (Gasquev
Commissioners of Inland Revenue [1940] 2 KB 8) but the company is not free to abandon one
domicile in favour of another one, as per a human being under the principles of Private
International Law (Conflict of Laws) (Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner and Keeler Ltd (No 3)
[1970] Ch 506). The only way in which a company may move from one jurisdiction to
another is if the members of that company promote a private Act of Parliament for that sole
purpose (e.g. the Henry Johnson, Sons & Co Limited Act 1996).
Residence is fixed by ascertaining where the companyâ€™s centre of control and management
is. Thus, a company may be resident in a number of countries where it has several centres of
control in different countries. The residence of a company is important in connection with its
liability to pay UK taxation.
Swedish Central Railway Co Ltdv Thompson[1925] AC 495
The company was incorporated in 1870 to construct a railway in Sweden, the registered office of
the company being in London. Later the management of the company was moved to Sweden but
the registered office remained in London, dealing only with formal administrative matters such as
share transfers. All dividends were declared in Sweden, and no part of the profits was ever sent to
England, except payment of dividend to English shareholders. The Commissioners of Income Tax
assessed the company for tax on income received in Sweden.
Held - a company could have more than one residence, though only one nationality and domicile.
This company was resident in Sweden and London, and since residence was relevant for income
tax purposes, the assessment of the Commissioners was affirmed.
A company must in all its business letters and order forms state whether it is registered in
England or Scotland, the registration number assigned to it (as shown in the certificate of
incorporation), and the address of its registered office. There are penalties in case of default.

The registered office
A companyâ€™s registered office may be, and often is with private companies, the office of its
accountants, and this is where formal communications will be sent. A Post Office box address
cannot be used because people (members and in some cases the public) have a right to visit
the registered office to inspect documents.
Purpose of registered office
The registered office is the companyâ€™s official address. It provides a place where legal documents, notices and other communications can be served. A document can be served on a
company by leaving it at, or sending it by registered or ordinary post to, the registered office.
(T O Supplies Ltd vJerry Creighton Ltd [1951] 1 KB 42.) If the company has no registered
office, claim forms and summonses may be served on the directors or the secretary at an office
which is not registered. Thus, in Re Fortune Copper Mining Co(1870) LR 10 Eq 390 the registered office of the company had been pulled down and a claim form was served on the secretary and the directors at an unregistered office. The court held that this was good service.
In an interesting development a change in the County Court Rules allows service of claim
forms, and other legal process, on a company not only at the companyâ€™s registered office
but also at any place of business, such as a branch, which has some real connection with the
cause or matter at issue. So if business has been conducted through a branch office which has
resulted in the supply of defective goods or services, legal process could be served on the
branch office. This assists the consumer, in particular, who will probably be more familiar
with the branch through which he has dealings than the situation of the registered office.
When the Registrar of Companies receives a communication returned as undeliverable at
the registered office, he will eventually set in motion the procedures for striking the company
âž¨ See p. 593 off the Register as a defunct company (see further Chapter 27 âž¨).
The registered office and insolvency proceedings
In order to implement EU regulations on insolvency proceedings, UK regulations, entitled the
Insolvency Act 1986 (Amendment) (No 2) Regulations 2002, were put into law. Before these
regulations came into force it was possible for a UK court to deal with insolvency proceedings
in regard to foreign companies provided that the company concerned had assets here. Under
the 2002 regulations that are numbered SI 2002/1240, the territory in which the corporate
debtor has its centre of main interests will have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings
against it. These are referred to as the main proceedings and the registered office is presumed
but not conclusively to be the centre of main interests. The courts of other countries can institute insolvency proceedings but only in regard to assets of the corporate debtor that are within
the jurisdiction of the court. These are called territorial proceedings which would not result
in, for example, the winding-up of the company. This would be a matter for the main proceedings. These matters receive further consideration in the chapters on corporate insolvency
and company rescue. However, the importance here is the role of the registered office in
deciding which country is entitled to conduct the main proceedings. The main thrust of
the regulations is to deal with companies within the EU but as will be seen in the insolvency
chapters a UK court has regarded itself as entitled to deal with insolvency matters where
the corporate debtor was an American company ruling that its centre of main interests was
the UK even though its registered office was in the United States (see Re Brac Rent-A-Car
International Inc.[2003] All ER (D) 98 (Feb)).

The constitution of the company -
the articles of association

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
Section 17 of the Companies Act 2006 defines a companyâ€™s constitution as including the
articles of association and â€˜any resolutions and agreements to which Chapter 3 applies
(see s 29)â€™. The most important aspects of the latter point being any special resolutions of
the shareholders (s 29(1)(a)); any unanimous resolution or agreement adopted by the members of a company, that it would not otherwise be binding on them unless passed by a special
resolution (s 29(1)(b)); and any resolution or agreement of a class of members binding all
members of the class (s 29(1)(c)). Two points should be made at this point. First of all, given
the reduced role of the memorandum of association under the Companies Act 2006, it does
not form part of the companyâ€™s constitution (see s 8); a contrast to the position under the
Companies Act 1985. Secondly, as will be discussed later, there is the suggestion that s 29 now
takes account of shareholder agreements as part of the companyâ€™s constitution.
The articles of association regulate the internal affairs of a company subject to those
matters which are otherwise specifically regulated by way of other sources of law. This in
turn offers an incredible amount of freedom and flexibility to a company to regulate its internal affairs. Unfortunately, as will be noted later in this chapter, such freedom has led to
academic debate, not so much as to what may be inserted into the articles of association,
but rather as to which portions of the articles will be subsequently recognised and enforced
by the courts.
Section 18 states that a company â€˜must have articles of association prescribing regulations
for the companyâ€™ unless it is a company to which model articles apply by virtue of s 20. It goes
on to note that the articles should be contained in â€˜a single documentâ€™ and â€˜divided into paragraphs numbered consecutivelyâ€™ (s 18(3)). In many respects, this latter point is common sense
and follows accepted good practice when drafting any legal document; so as to avoid confusion of interpretation or application a contractual document should aim to utilise short,
concise and self-contained paragraphs.
Turning to s 20, the Act states that if articles are not registered on the formation of a limited
company, or if the registered articles â€˜do not exclude or modify the relevant model articlesâ€™
(i.e. by way of the inclusion of a special provision expressly excluding their application), then
such model articles will form part of the companyâ€™s articles as if they had been duly registered
at the time of formation. This is an important point and one which anyone involved in the
formation of a company should be aware.
Therefore, a company may under s 18 have its own articles or adopt the relevant Model
Articles (see Appendix 1 of this book) â€˜prescribed for a company of that description as in force
at the date on which the company is registeredâ€™ (s 20(2)). It should be noted though that for
many existing companies, the relevant model articles that will be encountered will still remain
Table A (see Appendix 2 of this book). A not uncommon use of special provisions in the
articles of private companies is where they are subsidiaries and the holding company wants
to add extra provisions, not found in the model articles (or Table A), to the articles of the
subsidiary as a means of control over that subsidiary. The most usual clauses inserted into
the articles of the subsidiary are to the effect that certain transactions of the subsidiary, e.g.
borrowing over a set limit, require the approval of the shareholders of the subsidiary (the
holding company being, of course, the controlling shareholder) by ordinary resolution (a
â€˜general meetingâ€™ provision) or the consent of a nominated director who is a representative
of the holding company (the â€˜special directorâ€™ provision).
When amending or modifying the articles of association, a company must ensure that any
new provisions are not inconsistent with the legislation governing companies (Re Peveril Gold

The constitution of the company - the articles of association
Mines Ltd [1898] 1 Ch 122) and in line with the general law (Welton vSaffery [1897] AC 299)
otherwise they will be void. Aside from these restrictions, members may seek to include any
provisions which they feel to be appropriate to the company (Gaiman vNational Association
for Mental Health[1971] Ch 317), though the issue of insider/outsider rights should also be
borne in mind when considering such provisions (see discussion later in this chapter).
The articles deal with such matters as the appointment and powers of directors, general
meetings of the company, the voting rights of members, the transfer of shares, and dividends.
The rights of the different classes of shareholders may also be found in the articles if included
by way of special provisions. This has led many to refer to the articles as being equivalent to
the â€˜instruction bookâ€™ of a company. The contents of both Table Aand the new Model Articles
are outlined below.
Table Ais a comprehensive document which deals with virtually every aspect of the internal workings of a company and applies to a company incorporated under the Companies

As noted earlier, the emphasis of the Companies Act 2006 has been to â€˜think small firstâ€™ and
this approach is reflected in the fact that the new Model Articles have 53 provisions compared
with 118 under the 1985 Actâ€™s Table A. The new Model Articles apply to all companies incorporated after 1 October 2009 and, importantly, provide the same freedom to companies to
amend them (s 21 CA 2006).

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
The traditional division of powers under the articles
A companyâ€™s articles of association determine the manner in which power within a company
is divided between the shareholders in General Meeting and the Board of Directors. The relevant articles from both Table Aand the new Model Articles are set out below and illustrate
the â€˜defaultâ€™ setting for the division of powers though, as noted above, this may be amended
âž¨ See p. 115 by the company by altering its articles of association (see Chapter 5 âž¨).
Table A(CA 1985) - Article 70
70. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the memorandum and the articles and to any directions given by special resolution, the business of the company shall be managed by the directors who may exercise all the powers of the company. No alteration of the memorandum
or articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would
have been valid if that alteration had not been made or that direction had not been given.
The powers given by this regulation shall not be limited by any special power given to the
directors by the articles and a meeting of directors at which a quorum is present may exercise
all powers exercisable by the directors.
Model Articles for private companies limited by shares (CA 2006) -
Articles 3 and 4
3. Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the companyâ€™s
business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the company.
4. (1) The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain
from taking, specified action.
(2) No such special resolution invalidates anything which the directors have done before
the passing of the resolution.
It is worth bearing in mind at this stage that any division of powers that takes place via the
articles of association has significant implications for the running of a company. If shareholders subsequently wish to retract certain powers/responsibilities that have been granted to
directors, the only way forward is to amend the companyâ€™s articles of association by way of a
special resolution in General Meeting.
Imperial Hydropathic Hotel Co, Blackpoolv Hampson(1882) 23 Ch D 1
The articles of association provided that the directors could hold office for a period of three years
and then retire by rotation. At a general meeting which had been called for this purpose along with
other matters, resolutions were passed to remove two directors who were not due to retire under
the terms of the articles. Furthermore, they were to be replaced by two other individuals. The company claimed that the directors had been validly removed from office. Cotton LJ stated:
There is nothing in the Act or in the articles which directly enables a general meeting to remove directors; but the way it is put is this - that there is power in these articles, as there is power in the Act,
by a meeting duly called to pass a resolution altering the articles; and it is said that here there was a
resolution which would have been effectual to alter the articles that these directors whom the articles
did not authorise to be removed should be removed. Now in my opinion it is an entire fallacy to say
that because there is power to alter the regulations, you can by a resolution which might alter the

The traditional division of powers under the articles
regulations, do that which is contrary to the regulations as they stand in a particular and individual
case. It is in no way altering the regulations. The alteration of the regulations would be by introducing
a provision, not that some particular director be discharged from being a director, but that directors
be capable of being removed by the vote of a general meeting. It is a very different thing to pass a
general rule applicable to everyone who comes within it, and to pass a resolution against a particular
individual, which would be a privilegium and not a law. Now here there was no attempt to pass any
resolution at this meeting which would affect any director, except those who are aimed at by the
resolution, no alteration of the regulations was to bind the company to those regulations as altered;
and assuming, as I do for the present purpose, as the second meeting seems to have been regular
according to the notice, that everything was regularly done, what was done cannot be treated in my
opinion as an alteration first of the regulations, and then under that altered regulation as a removal of
the directors....
[In the present case] there is not a general alteration of the regulations of the company, but
simply an attempt, without altering the rules for the purpose, to remove a director, his removal being,
unless there is a general alteration, an illegal act on the part of those who attempt to remove him -
by illegal I mean an act ultra vires and not supported by any regulation of the company. Therefore,
I think that the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.
Held- The companyâ€™s articles of association could not be disregarded in this matter.
Similarly, where the articles provide that the companyâ€™s directors are responsible for the dayto-day running of the business, the shareholders have no power by way of ordinary resolution
to give directions to the board of directors or to overrule its decisions.
Automatic Self-Cleaning Filter Syndicate Co Ltdv Cuninghame[1906] 2 Ch 34
A company had power under its memorandum of association to sell its undertaking to another
company having similar objects, and by its articles of association the general management and
control of the company were vested in the directors, subject to such regulations as might from time
to time be made by extraordinary resolution, and, in particular, the directors were empowered to
sell or otherwise deal with any property of the company on such terms as they might think fit. At a
general meeting of the company a resolution was passed by a simple majority of the shareholders
for the sale of the companyâ€™s assets on certain terms to a new company formed for the purpose
of acquiring them, and directing the directors to carry the sale into effect. The directors, being of
opinion that a sale on those terms was not for the benefit of the company, declined to carry the
sale into effect.
Held- Upon the construction of the articles, that the directors could not be compelled to comply
with the resolution. Collins MR stated:
The point arises in this way. At a meeting of the company a resolution was passed by a majority -
I was going to say a bare majority, but it was a majority - in favour of a sale to a purchaser, and the
directors, honestly believing, as Warrington J thought, that it was most undesirable in the interests of
the company that that agreement should be carried into effect, refused to affix the seal of the company to it, or to assist in carrying out a resolution which they disapproved of; and the question is
whether under the memorandum and articles of association here the directors are bound to accept,
in substitution of their own view, the views contained in the resolution of the company. Warrington
J held that the majority could not impose that obligation upon the directors, and that on the true construction of the articles the directors were the personsauthorised by the articles to effect this sale,
and that unless the other powers given by the memorandum were invoked by a special resolution, it
was impossible for a mere majority at a meeting to override the views of the directors. That depends,
as Warrington J put it, upon the construction of the articles. First of all there is no doubt that the

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
company under its memorandum has the power in clause 3(k) to sell the undertaking of the company
or any part thereof. In this case there is some small exception, I believe, to that which is to be sold,
but I do not think that that becomes material. We now come to clause 81 of the articles, which I think
it is important to refer to in this connection. [His Lordship read the clause.] Then come the two clauses
which are most material, 96 and 97, whereby the powers of the directors are defined. [His Lordship
read clause 96 and clause 97(1).] Therefore in the matters referred to in article 97(1) the view of the
directors as to the fitness of the matter is made the standard; and furthermore, by article 96 they are
given in express terms the full powers which the company has, except so far as they â€˜are not hereby
or by statute expressly directed or required to be exercised or done by the companyâ€™, so that the
directors have absolute power to do all things other than those that are expressly required to be done
by the company; and then comes the limitation on their general authority - â€˜subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by extraordinary resolutionâ€™. Therefore, if it is desired to alter
the powers of the directors that must be done, not by a resolution carried by a majority at an ordinary
meeting of the company, but by an extraordinary resolution. In these circumstances it seems to me
that it is not competent for the majority of the shareholders at an ordinary meeting to affect or alter
the mandate originally given to the directors, by the articles of association. It has been suggested that
this is a mere question of principal and agent, and that it would be an absurd thing if a principal in
appointing an agent should in effect appoint a dictator who is to manage him instead of his managing the agent. I think that that analogy does not strictly apply to this case. No doubt for some purposes directors are agents. For whom are they agents? You have, no doubt, in theory and lawone
entity, the company, which might be a principal, but you have to go behind that when you look to the
particular position of directors. It is by the consensus of all the individuals in the company that these
directors become agents and hold their rights as agents. It is not fair to say that a majority at a meeting is for the purposes of this case the principal so as to alter the mandate of the agent. The minority also must be taken into account. There are provisions by which the minority may be over-borne,
but that can only be done by special machinery in the shape of special resolutions. Short of that the
mandate which must be obeyed is not that of the majority - it is that of the whole entity made up
of all the shareholders. If the mandate of the directors is to be altered, it can only be under the
machinery of the memorandum and articles themselves. I do not think I need say more.
Baronv Potter[1914] 1 Ch 895
The companyâ€™s two directors had reached deadlock whereby they no longer spoke to one another.
This in turn impacted on the ability to conduct effective board meetings. The plaintiff had called
a general meeting which had sought to appoint additional directors to the companyâ€™s board. The
defendant objected to this course of action, stating that the power to appoint new directors was
vested, according to the terms of the articles of association, in the directors.
Held- Due to the deadlocked position of the current directors of the company the power to appoint
reverted to the general meeting. Consequently, the appointment of additional directors was valid.
The legal effect of the articles
One aspect of the articles of association which has, until the coming into force of the new
Companies Act 2006, traditionally caused confusion for both scholars and students alike has
been their legal effect. Section 14 of the Companies Act 1985 has now been replaced by s 33
of the Companies Act 2006 which, significantly, has updated the wording of this traditionally
awkward section.

The legal effect of the articles
Section 33 of the Companies Act 2006, states that â€˜the provisions of a companyâ€™s constitution bind the company and its members to the same extent as if there were covenants on
the part of the company and of each member to observe those provisionsâ€™. Under s 14 of the
Companies Act 1985, the memorandum and articles, when registered, bound â€˜the company
and its members to the same extent as if they respectively had been signed and sealed by each
member, and contained covenants on the part of each member to observe all the provisions
of the memorandum and articlesâ€™.
The first point that needs to be made is that s 33 now includes the phrase â€˜on the part of the
company and each memberâ€™ as opposed to simply â€˜on the part of each memberâ€™. The wording of
this section, subject to slight variations, may be traced back to the Companies Act 1844, which
adopted the method of forming an unincorporated joint-stock company in existence at that
time. In effect, the wording of previous versions of s 33 appeared to suggest that the articles
bound only the members, ignoring the fact that the company was a separate legal entity. The
updated wording of the Companies Act 2006 appears to have eventually addressed this oversight. However, it has long since been assumed that the articles were binding as between
members and the company. Stirling J noted in Wood vOdessa Waterworks Co (1889) 42 Ch
D 636, that â€˜the articles of association constitute a contract not merely between the shareholders and the company, but between each individual shareholder and every otherâ€™.
Nevertheless, it is generally acknowledged that the situation was clarified, once and for all, in
the case of Hickman vKent or Romney Marshdiscussed below.
Secondly, s 33 makes reference to the companyâ€™s constitution as opposed to â€˜the memorandum and articlesâ€™. This reflects the careful consideration with which this area has been
revised by the Companies Act 2006. While the memorandum has effectively been reduced in
its significance, and as such its role within the s 33 statutory contract, there is recognition
of the role that other agreements may play within the day-to-day running of a company,
particularly private limited companies. It is also worth noting at this point that, according to
s 28, provisions which were contained in a companyâ€™s memorandum immediately before the
commencement of Part I of the Companies Act 2006, and are â€˜not provisions of the kind
mentioned in s 8 (provisions of the new-style memorandum), are to be treated after the
commencement of this Part as provisions of the companyâ€™s articlesâ€™ (s 28(1)).
The results of the statutory contract, as evidenced under s 14, were as follows:
(a) The memorandum and articles constituted a contract between the company and each
member. Thus, each member, in his capacity as member, was bound to the company by
the provisions in the articles. Furthermore, although s 14 did not state that the articles
bind the company to the members but only the members to the company, the company
was regarded as bound to each member in his capacity as member to observe the provisions in the articles.
(b) The memorandum and articles were also, by reason of case law, a contract between the
members themselves. Thus, one member can sue another if that other fails to observe a
provision in the memorandum or articles. However, the method by which this may be
undertaken is discussed in greater detail below in terms of the decision in MacDougall v
Gardiner(1875) 1 Ch D 13.
(c) No right given by the memorandum or articles to a member in a capacity other than that
of member (e.g. as solicitor or director) can be enforced against the company. The memorandum and articles are not a contract with outsiders but merely with the members in
respect of their rights as members.

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
To a large extent these points remain relevant for the s 33 statutory contract, though it is
suggested that both (a) and (b) have now been clarified by the rewording of this section under
the Companies Act 2006. Point (c) remains the subject of debate and will be examined in
the next section in the context of â€˜insiderâ€™ and â€˜outsiderâ€™ rights. Nevertheless, the case law in
relation to the statutory contract still remains of considerable use. For example, in London
Sack and Bag Co Ltd vDixon and Lugton Ltd [1943] 2 All ER 763, when considering the effect
of the statutory contract on the legal relationship between a companyâ€™s members, Scott LJ
observed â€˜...the statutory result may not be to constitute a contract between them about
rights of action created entirely outside the company relationship, such as trading transaction
between membersâ€™ but rather to be restricted to membership matters. In many respects this
reinforces the view that the purpose of the articles of association is to outline the way in which
the proper functioning of the company is to take place.
This is echoed in Welton vSaffery [1897] AC 299, when Lord Herschell observed:
It is quite true that the articles constitute a contract between each member and the company,
and that there is no contract in terms between the individual members of the company; but the
articles do not any the less, in my opinion, regulate their rights inter se. Such rights can only be
enforced by or against a member through the company, or through the liquidator representing
the company, but I think that no member has, as between himself and another member, any
right beyond that which the contract with the company gives.
However, this also introduces the notion that rights may only be enforced via the company
as opposed to directly between members and is based on the internal management principle
outlined in MacDougall vGardiner(1875) 1 Ch D 13 in which James LJ stated:
I think it is of the utmost importance in all these companies that the rule which is well known
in this court as the rule in...Foss vHarbottleshould be always adhered to; that is to say, that
nothing connected with internal disputes between the shareholders is to be made the subject
of a bill by someone shareholder on behalf of himself and others, unless there be something
illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent - unless there is something ultra vires on the part of the
company qua company, or on the part of the majority of the company, so that they are not fit
persons to determine it; but that every litigation must be in the name of the company, if the
company really desire it.
Consequently, when considering membership rights, it would appear that not only is there
a restriction on the type of actions which may be brought by members against other members, but also upon the mode by which such actions should take place. However, with an eye
on the notion of quasi-partnerships, which will be discussed further in this chapter, it is perhaps worth noting the comments of Vaisey J in Rayfield vHands [1960] Ch 1 when, having
granted an order in favour of Mr Rayfield which required the directors to take his shares in
accordance with the terms of the companyâ€™s articles, he stated: â€˜The conclusion to which I
have come may not be of so general application as to extend to the articles of association of
every company, for it is, I think, material to remember that this private company is one of that
class of companies which bears a close analogy to a partnership.â€™
The implications of this discussion will be examined in greater detail within Chapters 15
âž¨ See pp. 289 and 16 âž¨.
and 312 Finally, it is important to note that the term â€˜memorandum and articlesâ€™, has been updated
under the Companies Act 2006 to that of the companyâ€™s constitution (see s 17). Also note the
âž¨ See p. 79 effect of s 28(1) as outlined above and in the previous chapter âž¨.

The legal effect of the articles
Woodv Odessa Waterworks Co(1889) 42 Ch D 636
The articles of association empowered the directors with the approval of the general meeting to
declare â€˜a dividend to be paid to the membersâ€™. The directors recommended that instead of paying
a dividend, members should be given debenture-bonds bearing interest repayable at par, by annual
drawings, extending over 30 years. The recommendation was approved by the company in general
meeting by an ordinary resolution. The plaintiff successfully sought an injunction restraining the
company from acting on the resolution on the ground that it breached the articles. Stirling J stated:
...the rights of the shareholders in respect of a division of the profits of the company are governed
by the provisions of the articles of association. By s 16 of the Companies Act 1862 (now s 33 of the
Companies Act 2006), the articles of association â€˜bind the company and the members thereof to the
same extent as if each member had subscribed his name and affixed his seal thereto, and there were
in such articles contained a covenant on the part of himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators,
to conform to all the regulations contained in such articles, subject to the provisions of this Act.â€™...
Those articles provide that the directors may, with the sanction of a general meeting, declare a dividend
to be paid to the shareholders. Prima facie, that means to be paid in cash. The debenture-bonds proposed to be issued are not payments in cash; they are merely agreements or promises to pay: and if the
contention of the company prevails a shareholder will be compelled to accept in lieu of cash a debt of
the company payable at some uncertain future period. In my opinion that contention ought not to prevail.
Hickmanv Kent or Romney Marsh Sheepbreedersâ€™ Association[1915] 1 Ch 881
The defendant company was incorporated under the Companies Acts in 1895. The objects of the
company were to encourage and retain as pure the sheep known as Kent or Romney Marsh, and
the establishment of a flock book listing recognised sires and ewes to be bred from. The articles
provided for disputes between the company and the members to be referred to arbitration. This
action was brought in the Chancery Division by the claimant because the Association had refused
to register certain of his sheep in the flock book, and he asked for damages for this. It also appeared
that the Association was trying to expel him, and he asked for an injunction to prevent this.
Held - by Astbury J - that the Association was entitled to have the action stayed. The articles
amounted to a contract between the Association and the claimant to refer disputes to arbitration.
However, Astbury J, after accepting that the articles were a contract between a company and its
members, went on to say:
[...] No right merely purporting to be given by an article to a person, whether a member or not, in a
capacity other than that of a member, as for instance, a solicitor, promoter, director, can be enforced
against the company.
(i) It was held, by the Court of Appeal, applying Hickman, in Beattie v E and F Beattie Ltd[1938]
Ch 708, that a provision in the articles that disputes between the company and its members must
be referred to arbitration did not apply to a person whose dispute was between the company and
himself as director even though he was also a member.
(ii) In Pender v Lushington (1877) 6 Ch D 70, the chairman of a meeting of members refused to
accept Penderâ€™s votes. The articles gave one vote for every 10 shares to the shareholders. This
caused a resolution proposed by Pender to be lost. He asked the court to grant an injunction to
stop the directors acting contrary to the resolution.
Held - Pender succeeded. The articles were a contract binding the company to the members.

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
Rayfieldv Hands[1958] 2 All ER 194
The articles of a private company provided by Art II that â€˜Every member who intends to transfer his
shares shall inform the directors who will take the said shares equally between them at a fair valueâ€™.
The claimant held 725 fully paid shares of Â£1 each, and he asked the defendants, the three directors of the company, to buy them but they refused. He brought this action to sue upon the contract created by the articles without joining the company as a party.
Held - by Vaisey J - that the directors were bound to take the shares. Having regard to what is
now s 14, the provisions of Art II constituted a binding contract between the directors, as members, and the claimant, as a member, in respect of his rights as a member. The word â€˜willâ€™ in
the article did not import an option in the directors. Vaisey J did say that the conclusion he had
reached in this case may not apply to all companies, but it did apply to a private company,
because such a company was an intimate concern closely analogous with a partnership.
(i) Although the articles placed the obligation to take shares of members on the directors, Vaisey
J construed this as an obligation falling upon the directors in their capacity as members. Otherwise,
the contractual aspect of the provision in the articles would not have applied. (See Beattie vE and
F Beattie Ltd[1938] Ch 708.)
(ii) The companyâ€™s Art II was a pre-emption clause. Many such clauses use the expression â€˜may
take the said sharesâ€™. If so, no contract is formed. The word â€˜mayâ€™ indicates that there is an option
whether to accept or not.
Eleyv Positive Government Security Life Assurance Co(1876) 1 Ex D 88
The articles contained a clause appointing the claimant as solicitor of the company. The claimant
was not appointed by a resolution of the directors or by any instrument under the seal of the company, but he did act as solicitor for some time and took shares in the company at a later stage.
The company ceased to employ him, and he brought an action for breach of contract.
Held - by the Court of Appeal - that the action failed because there was no contract between the
company and Eley under the articles. He was an outsider in his capacity as a solicitor, and presumably even though he was also a member, he could not enforce the articles since they gave him
rights in his capacity as solicitor only, though his rights as a member to enforce the articles are not
dealt with specifically in the judgment.
It was held by the court of first instance that a service contract on the terms set out in the articles
was created because Eley had actually served the company as its solicitor. However, the contract
was unenforceable because the articles contemplated his employment for an indefinite period of
time, possibly longer than a year, and there was no written memorandum of the contract signed
on behalf of the company as was then required by s 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677. This statute
is now repealed so that the case may have been decided differently today. This view is reinforced
by the decision in Re New British Iron Co, ex parte Beckwith(see below) because surely when
Eley took office he did so on the terms of the articles and had an implied contract based upon the
terms of those articles. Thus, if a term as to tenure could be implied in the way that a term as to
salary was in Beckwith, then Eley should have been able to sue for breach of the implied contract.
Readâ€™s case (see below) suggests also the tenure of office may be based on the articles.

The articles and insider/outsider rights
The articles and insider/outsider rights
The case of Salomon vSalomonhas been described as both a blessing and a curse to modern
company law. (Refer to suggested further reading at the end of this chapter.) Although the
article is a little dated and the proposals for reform are not relevant, some good criticisms of
the Salomon decision are offered. While the case confirmed the fact that, once registered,
a company is a separate legal entity in the eyes of the law, it has also had a negative impact on
the s 33 statutory contract.
Until Salomon, it was generally accepted that the company format was an inappropriate
vehicle for small commercial enterprises. Rather, such enterprises should adopt the partnership format. However, this case changed the corporate landscape forever. In essence, it
encouraged the growth of small private companies, which over time evolved into the widely
accepted genre of â€˜quasi-partnershipâ€™ companies (Oâ€™Neill vPhillips[1999] 2 BCLC 1). As the
name suggests â€˜quasi-partnershipâ€™ companies are operated internally on a basis far closer to
that of a partnership than a â€˜pureâ€™ corporate structure. In other words, they contain a small
number of shareholders some, or all, of whom have expectations as to their role in the company. This may include expectations such as being one of the directors. In Oâ€™Neill vPhillips,
Lord Hoffmann stated that:
In a quasi-partnership company, there will usually be understandings between the members
at the time they entered into the association. But there may be later promises, by words or
conduct, which it would be unfair to allow a member to ignore. Nor is it necessary that such
promises should be independently enforceable as a matter of contract. A promise may be binding as a matter of justice and equity, although for one reason or another...it would not be
enforceable in law.
These expectations may be evidenced in a number of ways - ranging from clauses in the
articles of association to separate shareholdersâ€™ agreements (mentioned below) and possibly a
driving force behind s 17.
Today, this type of company is widely recognised and acknowledged as being a fundamental part of modern company law. However, a hundred years ago the development of this
type of company led to many problems - the most significant of which centred on the use and
â€˜misuseâ€™ of s 33 (or rather its equivalent section under previous Companies Acts).
As quasi-partnership companies became more popular, the members of these enterprises
wished to evidence their expectations (e.g. to be a director) and as such wished to include
additional clauses into the companyâ€™s constitution to this effect. As noted above, s 21 provides
the ideal method by which members may update the companyâ€™s constitution. A General Meeting
is called, at which a special resolution (75 per cent) is passed and the articles are duly amended.
Everyone agrees because (usually) everyone is on an amicable and cooperative footing.
The problem arises when there is a dispute. At that point in time, the disgruntled individual will attempt to enforce his/her contractual right, under s 33, to be (as per the example
above), a director of the company. An action is then brought before the courts to determine
whether such a right may, or may not, be enforced.
This may not appear to be a particularly significant problem. However, in reality it is.
Remember, the purpose of the articles of association is to regulate the internal affairs of a
company (i.e. to provide detailed instructions as to how the company is to work/function).
Furthermore, as Drury notes (see suggested further reading at the end of this chapter), one

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
must bear in mind that the lifespan of a company may be several hundred years. In the overall scheme of things, the issue as to who is entitled to be a director and/or company solicitor
is irrelevant to the continued existence and operation of a company.
Therefore, a significant number of the clauses which were added to the articles of association over the years were irrelevant to the operation of the company in question. As such, the
question needed to be asked as to whether or not the court should recognise such clauses as
being valid and furthermore whether they should enforce these clauses. Two cases provide
alternative views on this subject: Quin & Axtens vSalmon; Eley vPositive Life.
Salmonv Quin & Axtens Ltd[1909] 1 Ch 311
The memorandum of the company included among its objects the purchasing of real or personal
property. By the articles the business was to be managed by the directors, but no resolution of the
board to purchase or lease any premises of the company was to be valid unless two conditions
were satisfied, namely notice in writing must be given to each of the two managing directors
named in the articles, and neither of them must have dissented therefrom in writing before or at
the meeting at which the resolution was to be passed. In August 1908 the board passed resolutions for the purchase of certain premises by the company, and for leasing part of the companyâ€™s
property. The claimant, who was one of the managing directors, dissented, but at an extraordinary
general meeting of the company held in November 1908, resolutions similar to those passed by
the board were passed by an ordinary resolution of the members. The claimant brought this action
for an injunction to stop the company from acting on the resolutions as they were inconsistent with
the articles.
Held - eventually by the House of Lords (see Quin & Axtens vSalmon[1909] AC 442) - an injunction would be granted.
The claimant sued on behalf of himself and other shareholders to prevent the majority and the
company from acting contrary to the companyâ€™s constitution. This is in line with the contractual
right highlighted by Jordan CJ in Australian Coal and Shale Employeesâ€™ Federation v Smith
(1937) 38 SR (NSW) 48, as t he â€˜shareholderâ€™s right to have the articles observed by the companyâ€™.
It is worth looking at Wedderburn (1957) â€˜Shareholder Rights and the Rule in Foss v Harbottleâ€™,
CLJ 193 in which he suggests that this judgment supports his view that every member has a personal right under the statutory contract (as it forms a contract between the company and its shareholders) to ensure that the company is run according to its articles of association. He goes on to
suggest that a member could bring a personal claim to enforce this right, even though this may
have the effect of enforcing a right conferred on this individual in a capacity other than as a member. However, the action must be brought in his/her capacity as a member. This is an interesting
proposition and raises the question as to whether this case may be used to enable a solicitor who
was also a shareholder indirectly to enforce a provision in the companyâ€™s articles that he is to
be the companyâ€™s solicitor by saying to the company â€˜conduct business in accordance with the
articlesâ€™. (See Eley v Positive Life.) According to Prentice, though (see (1980) â€˜The Enforcement
of Outsider Rightsâ€™, 1 Co Law 179) only those articles â€˜definitive of the power of the company
to functionâ€™ have contractual effect. Another view offered by Goldberg is that â€˜a member of a
company has...a contractual right to have any of the affairs of the company conducted by the
particular organ of the company specified in the Act or the companyâ€™s memorandum or articlesâ€™.
Another case which is relevant to this debate is Beattie v E & F Beattie Ltd [1938] Ch 708,
which involved an action against an individual who was both a member and director of the company in question. The director sought to rely on a clause in the articles which required all disputes

The articles and insider/outsider rights
between the company and a member to be referred to arbitration. The court held that the article
did not constitute a contract between the company and the defendant director in his capacity as
a director. Consequently, he was not entitled to rely upon the provision. The decision was affirmed
by the Court of Appeal. The question is whether the outcome would have been different if the
defendant director had been sued in his capacity as a member rather than that of director.
A solution was required which would alleviate the pressure on the courts to recognise and
subsequently enforce additional clauses which had been validly (and legally) added to the
articles of association, while at the same time ensuring that the articles remained focused on
the internal regulation of the company, free of additional and irrelevant clauses. In the case of
Hickman vKent or Romney Marsh the courts attempted to reconcile the debate as to what
could, or could not, be enforced under the s 33 statutory contract. In this case, Astbury J stated:
First, no article can constitute a contract between the company and a third person; secondly,
no right merely purporting to be given by an article to a person, whether a member or not, in
a capacity other than that of a member, as for instance a solicitor, promoter or director can be
enforced against the Company; thirdly, articles regulating the rights and obligations of the
members generally as such do create rights and obligations between them and the company
respectively.
The effect of this judgment is predominantly twofold. First of all, it poses the question as
to who is attempting to enforce a provision contained within the articles of association. This
essentially goes back to a privity of contract issue - the parties to the statutory contract are the
company and the members (now clarified under the newly worded s 33 of the Companies Act
2006). As Astbury J observed:
An outsider to whom rights purport to be given by the articles in his capacity as such outsider,
whether he is or subsequently becomes a member, cannot sue on those articles treating them as
contracts between himself and the company to enforce those rights. Those rights are not part of
the general regulations of the company applicable alike to all shareholders and can only exist by
virtue of some contract between such person and the company, and the subsequent allotment
of shares to an outsider in whose fabour such an article is inserted does not enable him to sue
the company on such an article.
Consequently, non-members cannot enforce the statutory contract, no matter how closely involved with the running of the company they may appear to the outside world (i.e. directors).
Secondly, it poses the question as to the type of right that the individual is attempting to
enforce. It draws a distinction between those rights given to an individual in his/her capacity
as a member and those rights given to a person in a capacity other than that of a member. It
is this aspect of the judgment which introduced the concept of insider and outsider rights into
company law. As Greene MR observed in Beattie vE and F Beattie Ltd[1938] Ch 708, â€˜the
contractual force given to the articles of association by the section is limited to such provisions of the articles as apply to the relationship of the members in their capacity as membersâ€™.
While this would appear to provide quite an elegant solution to the problem outlined
above, it nevertheless introduced a number of new problems/questions. These include:
(a) Can a judicial limitation be placed on a statutory provision? In other words, s 33 states
that â€˜those provisionsâ€™ within the companyâ€™s constitution must be observed by the company and each member whereas the Hickman judgment states that only membership
(insider) rights should be observed.

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
(b) Where does one draw the distinction between membership (insider) rights and nonmembership (outsider) rights? It is an artificial line which has been the subject of
considerable academic debate over the years. Equally, as with any rule, it is subject to
exceptions. Indeed, there is a suggestion that Hickman may be â€˜side-steppedâ€™ in many
instances through the identification of membership rights (see Gower and Davies (2008)
Principles of Modern Company Law).
(c) With respect to quasi-partnerships, members may have entered into a commercial
relationship and amended the articles of their companies in good faith so as to evidence
the true basis of the internal management structure of their business. What is a member
to do if, in the event of a dispute, the courts refuse to recognise and enforce this â€˜legitimateâ€™ right? If a member is provided with no forum in which to express a complaint or
potential remedy then this will in turn have a negative impact on the corporate sector -
after all, who would invest in a company which had no method of recourse in the event
of a dispute over bona fide (legitimate) expectations? This will be discussed later in
âž¨ See p. 360 Chapter 18 âž¨ and s 994 of the Companies Act 2006.
In order to appreciate the academic debate surrounding the s 33 statutory contract and the
implications of the Hickmanjudgment, there is no substitute for reading the main academic
articles. (Refer to the suggested further reading at the end of this chapter.)
A provision in the articles can become part of a contract between the company and a
member or outsider in the following ways:
(a) where there is an express contract and a provision in the articles is expressly incorporated
into that contract by a provision therein;
(b) where a provision in the articles is incorporated by implication arising out of the conduct
of the parties, or where an express contract between the parties is silent on a particular
aspect, e.g. in the case of a director, the length of his appointment. In such a case reference may be made to the articles in order to fill the gap, if those documents contain a
relevant provision.
Re New British Iron Co, ex parte Beckwith[1898] 1 Ch 324
Beckwith was employed as a director of the company, relying for his remuneration on the companyâ€™s articles which provided that the directors should be paid Â£1,000 per annum. In this action
by Beckwith for his fees, it was held - by Wright J - that, although the articles did not constitute a
contract between the company and Beckwith in his capacity as director, he had nevertheless
accepted office and worked on the footing of the articles, and as such the company was liable to
pay him his fees on that basis. Actually the company was liable on an implied contract, the articles
being merely referred to for certain of its terms.
Readv Astoria Garage (Streatham) Ltd[1952] Ch 637
The defendant company was a private company which had adopted Art 68 of Table A of the
Companies Act 1929. The articles provided for the appointment of a managing director, and said
that he could be dismissed at any time and without any period of notice, if the company so
resolved by a special resolution. The claimantâ€™s contract made in 1932 appointed him managing

The effect of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999
director at a salary of Â£7 per week but said nothing about notice. The directors dismissed him on
11 May 1949 at one monthâ€™s notice, and later called an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders and got the necessary resolution. The special resolution was passed on 28 September
1949, and Readâ€™s salary was paid until that date but not afterwards. Read now sued for wrongful
dismissal, suggesting that he ought to have had more notice because a person holding his position would customarily have more notice than he had been given.
Held - by the Court of Appeal - that since the claimantâ€™s contract was silent on the point, Art 68
was incorporated into the express contract. Once this was done, the notice he had been given was
most generous and his claim therefore failed, his tenure of office being based on the articles.
Although the above decisions are concerned with a member enforcing or being bound by
a provision in the articles which was personal to himself as a member (e.g. a right to the vote
attaching to his shares as in Pender vLushington, 1877), the principles involved may go further than this. There is some authority for the view that each member has a right under the
articles to have the companyâ€™s affairs conducted in accordance with the articles; Quin &
Axtens vSalmon.
Finally, it is worth noting that such matters involving â€˜outsider rightsâ€™ could be dealt with
in a separate contract such as a shareholderâ€™s agreement, which we shall examine in the next
The effect of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
The above Act does not apply to the statutory contract between a company and its members
in terms of the provisions in a companyâ€™s constitution, as set out in s 33.
According to s 6(2) of the Act it specifically excludes its application so as to prevent thirdparty rights from arising. Thus, the decision in Eley v Positive Government Security Life
Assurance Co, 1876 still stands and would not or could not be affected by the 1999 Act.
Interpretation of the articles
As noted, section 33, CA 2006 provides that the articles form a contract between the company
and its members. As such, when considering the interpretation of the articles, the traditional
rules of contractual interpretation should apply. However, as also noted above, the articles
form a unique type of statutory contract which is subject to certain limitations.
Scottv Frank F Scott (London) Ltd[1940] Ch 794 (Court of Appeal)
The company adopted as its articles of association Table A with certain modifications, and the
whole of the share capital was issued to the three brothers in equal shares. The control of the
company was in the hands of the ordinary shareholders, the preference shareholders only having
a right of voting at a general meeting upon such questions as reduction of capital, winding-up
of the company, sanctioning a sale of the undertaking or altering the regulations of the company
so as to affect directly the rights of the preference shareholders. Frank Stanley Scott died on
10 September 1937, and his widow, who was the sole executrix of his will, became entitled

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
thereunder to all his preference and ordinary shares in the company. No question arose in regard
to the preference shares, but she claimed the right to be placed on the register of members
in respect of his ordinary shares. The two surviving brothers, however, claimed that under the
articles of association, she was bound to offer to them her testatorâ€™s ordinary shares and that they
had the right to acquire them at par. She therefore commenced an action against the company and
the two surviving brothers, in which she sought a declaration that she was entitled to have her
name entered on the register of members of the company as the holder of 100 ordinary shares.
The defendants in their counter-claim sought a declaration that, upon the true construction of
the articles of association, the two brothers had the right to acquire from the plaintiff these 100
ordinary shares at par and, if the construction they asked the Court to put on the articles of association should not be the correct construction, then they sought rectification of the articles so as
to give them the right to acquire these shares from the plaintiff at par. Luxmoore LJ stated:
The next question which falls to be considered is whether the defendants are entitled to have the
articles of association rectified in the manner claimed by them. Bennett J said he was prepared to
hold that the articles of association as registered were not in accordance with the intention of the
three brothers who were the only signatories of the memorandum and articles of association, and
down to the date of Frank Stanley Scottâ€™s death the only shareholders therein. Bennett J, however,
held that the Court has no jurisdiction to rectify articles of association of a company, although they
do not accord with what is proved to have been the concurrent intention of all the signatories therein
at the moment of signature. We are in complete agreement with this decision. It seems to us that
there is no room in the case of a company incorporated under the appropriate statute or statutes for
the application to either the memorandum or articles of association of the principles upon which
a Court of Equity permits rectification of documents whether inter partes or not...
Held- The Court has no jurisdiction to rectify the articles of association of a company even if those
articles do not accord with what is proved to have been the concurrent intention of the signatories
at the moment of signature.
Due to the fact that the model articles are prescribed in subordinate legislation (SI 2008/3229),
they must be interpreted in accordance with the Interpretation Act 1978. If additional articles
are adopted alongside the model articles then these provisions should also be interpreted in
accordance with the Interpretation Act 1978 (FellvDerby Leather Co Ltd [1931] 2 Ch 252).
The courts will not consider the effect which the additional or amended articles were intended
to have (RosevLynx Express Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 447), though it will add words so as to
avoid absurdity (Folkes Group plc vAlexander [2002] EWHC 51 (Ch)). Equally, the court will
not exercise its power to imply terms into the articles so as to provide business efficacy to a
scheme which the shareholders had in mind but which may not be readily apparent from the
wording of the articles (Bratton Seymour Service Co Ltd v Oxborough [1992] BCLC 693).
However, the court will seek to construe the words used in the articles so as to give them
reasonable business efficacy (Holmes vKeyes [1959] Ch 199).
Shareholdersâ€™ agreements
It is worth noting the increase in shareholdersâ€™ agreements which often, in private companies,
supplement the articles of association and which, it is suggested, have been included within
the meaning of a companyâ€™s constitution under the new Companies Act 2006: s 29.

Shareholdersâ€™ agreements
A shareholdersâ€™ agreement operates as a binding contract and deals with the rights and
duties of members of a particular company to which it applies. It may be made by all members of the company, or be limited to a portion of them. Equally, given the fact that this is a
traditional contract, individuals who are not shareholders in that particular company may be
a party to the agreement if it is felt appropriate. The agreement can be made orally and does
not need to be in writing, though of course this will impact on the practicability of an individualâ€™s ability to rely upon it should the need arise.
Such an agreement may be made at any time during the lifetime of a company, but it is
most commonly made when a new company is established, thereby establishing areas of
agreement between those involved. An excellent example of where one may find such an
agreement is in a quasi-partnership company. However, it should be stressed at the outset that
to be truly effective as a constitutional document, all members of the company should be
made parties to the agreement.
The main benefit to be derived from a shareholdersâ€™ agreement is the fact that it is
not restricted in the same way as the articles of association (i.e. limited to the enforcement of
membership rights). Therefore, if members wish to agree between themselves some matter
which is unrelated to their membership rights, they may enter into this type of agreement to
that effect. For example, in Wilkinson vWest Coast Capital[2005] EWHC 3009 (Ch), a shareholdersâ€™ agreement provided (a) in Clause 5 that specific actions could only be pursued by
the company if 65 per cent of the shareholders provided their consent; and (b) in Clause 7
that the shareholders should use all reasonable and proper means to promote the interests
of the company. The combination of these two clauses meant that shareholder-directors
are to use their vote so as to prevent the company from pursuing certain opportunities
and thereby preventing them from being classified as â€˜corporate opportunitiesâ€™ and subsequently enabling them to pursue them themselves. A minority shareholder unsuccessfully
brought an action under s 994, CA 2006 on the grounds that this was unfairly prejudicial
Equally, given the fact that shareholder agreements are governed by common law, their
terms can only be altered if there is 100 per cent agreement by those who signed the contract.
This differs to the alteration of the articles, which under s 21(1) only requires a special
resolution (75 per cent). Furthermore, as per Russell v Northern Bank (below), the courts
appear to accept the existence of shareholdersâ€™ agreements, providing them with a degree
of legitimacy, power and scope.
Another significant advantage of such an agreement is that the contents remain private
and the agreement does not have to be registered at Companies House along with the other
formal constitutional documents. Therefore, the shareholdersâ€™ agreement is not available for
public inspection.
The key problem with these agreements is that they, in effect, create another branch of
the companyâ€™s constitution. As such, it is not surprising that the Companies Act 2006
has sought to include shareholder agreements within the meaning of the constitution of the
If there is a dispute between shareholders, it will often be the case that the shareholdersâ€™
agreement will be referred to first, between the constitutional documents. This could cause
a problem, however, if there is a conflict between the terms of the articles and the terms
of the external agreement. The key case concerning shareholder agreements is Russell v
Northern Bank.

Chapter 4 The constitution of the company - the articles of association
Russellv Northern Bank Development Corporation Ltd[1992] 1 WLR 588
Five individuals agreed to refrain from voting to increase the companyâ€™s share capital, unless all
parties agreed to the increase (in writing). Subsequently, the company sought to increase capital,
but one member of the agreement was against this increase. In court, he argued that the fellow
members were acting contrary to the terms of the membership agreement. The other members of
the agreement counter-claimed by saying that by enforcing the terms of the shareholdersâ€™ agreement, the court would in effect restrict the court from acting within its statutory power.
The House of Lords (reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal) stated that shareholdersâ€™
agreements were valid and enforceable. Lord Jauncey provided a quotation from Lord Davey in
Welton vSaffery[1897] AC 299, who stated:
Of course, individual shareholders may deal with their own interests by contract in such a way as they
may think fit. By such contracts, whether made by all or only some of the shareholders, would create
personal obligations, or an exception personalis against themselves only, and would not become
a regulation of the company, or be binding on the transferees of the parties, or upon new or nonassenting shareholders.
Although, strictly speaking, the judgment says that a company may not be bound by one, it is without doubt that the company (practically speaking) is restricted, as it is the members who guide the
company. Potentially, a member of a company could obtain an injunction to prevent other members of the company (party to a membership agreement) to restrain from allowing the company to
perform an act, which it is statutorily able to do.
In Euro Brokers Holdings Ltd vMonecor (London) Ltd, 2003 the court applied the Duomatic
principle to such a shareholdersâ€™ agreement. The principle which is derived from the decision
in Re Duomatic [1969] 2 Ch 365 states that the informal and unanimous assent of all the companyâ€™s shareholders can override formal requirements as where a particular course of action
requires a meeting and resolution of the shareholders, either under statutory provisions or
because of the requirements of the companyâ€™s articles, and no such meeting and/or resolution
has been held or passed or written resolution made.
Nevertheless, if there is evidence that the shareholders were unanimously agreed on the
matter, the court may accept the resulting transaction as valid.
Euro Brokers Holdings Ltdv Monecor (London) Ltd[2003] 1 BCLC 506
So far as the facts of Euro Brokers are concerned, the matter in issue was a call made on the companyâ€™s two shareholders requiring them to advance more capital. The finance director made the
call by means of an e-mail though the shareholdersâ€™ agreement required that the call be made by
a notice from the board. Nevertheless, both shareholders regarded the call as valid and agreed to
send the sums required to the company. Later, one of the shareholders failed to forward the full
amount. Under the shareholdersâ€™ agreement this triggered a right in the other shareholder to
acquire the shares of the defaulter at an agreed price. The defaulter was not prepared to accept
this situation and challenged the validity of the call in terms that it had not been made by the
formal notice of the board. This defence was rejected by the Court of Appeal. The shareholders
had accepted the call in the manner in which it was made and the Duomatic principle could
therefore be applied. In consequence, the defaulting shareholder could be required to sell his
entire holding to the claimant.

Essay questions
A typical shareholdersâ€™ agreement may include:
â— Undertakings and agreements from prospective shareholders before the company is formed.
â— Matters that it would be inappropriate to put on the public record such as confidentiality
undertakings and non-competition restrictions, the right of certain shareholders to appoint
directors and dispute resolution.
â— Protection of minority shareholders if required. Thus, although alteration of the articles
requires a special resolution, i.e. a 75 per cent majority of votes, a shareholdersâ€™ agreement
can require written consent from all shareholders so protecting those with minority holdings.
â— Internal management issues which the members wish to keep off the public record, e.g.
who should be entitled to appoint a director, choice of bankers, and the policy of the company on loans and borrowing together with cheque signatories.
Finally, it is worth noting in relation to the protection of minority shareholders under
s 994, CA 2006, that a shareholdersâ€™ agreement will carry a considerable amount of weight in
terms of the court determining whether or not â€˜unfairly prejudicialâ€™ conduct has occurred.

The constitution of the company -
altering the articles

The constitution of the company - altering the articles
The articles of association may be amended by a special resolution in general meeting (s 21
of the Companies Act 2006). A copy of the revised articles must be sent to the Registrar
â€˜not later than 15 days after the amendment takes effectâ€™ (s 26(1)). If the company fails to
comply with this requirement, then under s 26(1) an offence is committed by the company
and every officer of the company who is in default. Section 27(1) goes on to note that the
Registrar may give notice to the company to comply with this requirement within 28 days of
issue. Continued failure by the company to comply may result in a civil penalty of Â£200 in
addition to criminal proceedings (s 27(4)).
The important point to appreciate is that any member of a company enters into a contract,
the terms of which may be amended by the company in general meeting at any time in the
future. While this may appear to go against the most basic principles of contract law, it is
important to remember that this is a statutory contract by virtue of s 33 of the Companies Act
2006. Indeed, as noted in Greenhalghv Arderne Cinemas, 1951 by Evershed MR â€˜[...] when
a man comes into a company, he is not entitled to assume that the articles will always remain
in a particular formâ€™. If one takes time to reflect on the situation and to bear in mind the
observations of Drury (see the suggested reading at the end of the chapter), the company
represents a separate legal entity whose existence will, in most instances, extend far beyond
either the involvement or life expectancy of the current members. As such, the company is
subject to specific decision-making processes (in this instance s 21) that enable it to respond
to its environment and to update its constitution accordingly (Shuttleworth v Cox, 1927).
Indeed, this is reinforced by the case of Russellv Northern Bank, 1992, in which the House
of Lords stated that â€˜a provision in a companyâ€™s articles which restricts its statutory power
to alter those articles is invalidâ€™. Any contract by a company which purports to agree that its
articles will not be amended in the future will not be enforced by the courts.
Puntv Symons & Co Ltd[1903] 2 Ch 506
GG Symons was given the power, under articles 95 and 97 of the companyâ€™s articles, to appoint and
remove directors. This power would continue to exist after his death for exercise by his executors.
A separate agreement stated that the company would refrain from amending these articles in the
future. In time, the relationship between the executors and the companyâ€™s directors deteriorated,
resulting in a proposal to amend the articles by way of a special resolution. The executors sought
an injunction to prevent this action. In this regard, Byrne J said:
The first point taken is that passing the resolution would be a breach of the contract which was
entered into with the testator; and that the plaintiffs as executors are entitled to enforce the terms of
the agreement by restraining any alteration of the articles. I think the answer to this argument is - that
the company cannot contract itself out of the right to alter its articles, though it cannot, by altering its
articles, commit a breach of contract. It is well established as between a company and a shareholder,
the right not depending upon a special contract outside the articles, that this is the case. It has not
been, so far as I know, the precise subject of reported decision as between a contractor and a company where the contract is independent of and outside the articles; but in the case of Allen vGold
Reefs of West Africa Lord Lindley, then Master of the Rolls, says: â€˜The articles of a company prescribe the regulations binding on its members: Companies Act, 1862, s 14. They have the effect of a
contract (see s 16); but the exact nature of this contract is even now very difficult to define. Be its
nature what it may, the company is empowered by the statute to alter the regulations contained in
its articles from time to time by special resolutions (ss 50 and 51); and any regulation or article
purporting to deprive the company of this power is invalid on the ground that it is contrary to the
statute: Walker v London Tramways Co. The power thus conferred on companies to alter the

Chapter 5 The constitution of the company - altering the articles
regulations contained in their articles is limited only by the provisions contained in the statute and the
conditions contained in the companyâ€™s memorandum of association...I am prepared to hold that in
the circumstances of the present case the contract could not operate to prevent the article being
altered under the provisions of s 50 of the Companies Act, 1862, whatever the result of that alteration
Held- On this particular point the executors failed and the court refused to enforce the terms of
the contract preventing an amendment of the articles. However, they did succeed on another
point, which related to the directorsâ€™ misue of power in terms of issuing new shares so as to dominate the General Meeting.
This process of amendment is subject to the principle of majority rule; a topic that will be
âž¨ See p. 334 discussed later in Chapter 17 âž¨, but which raises the immediate concern of how this process
is governed so as to ensure that the majority may not take advantage of their position to the
detriment of a minority within the company. First of all, s 25(1) provides that a member will
not be bound by an alteration of the articles if it requires him to subscribe for more shares
than the number currently held, or in any way increases his liability to contribute to the companyâ€™s share capital.
Secondly, even though the general rule is that a company cannot restrict its power to
amend its articles, s 22 of the Companies Act 2006 permits members to entrench provisions
within the companyâ€™s articles. In other words, the articles may contain provisions which
may be â€˜amended or repealed only if conditions are met, or procedures complied with, that
are more restrictive than those applicable in the case of a special resolutionâ€™ (s 22(1)).
For example, this may include the consent of a particular member of the attainment of
a higher percentage of the members in general meeting than that required for a special resolution. However, given the potential impact that entrenched provisions within a companyâ€™s
constitution may have, s 22(3) goes on to state that such provisions may be amended subject
to the agreement of all the members of the company or by order of the court. In addition,
under s 23, the Registrar must be given notice of the existence of entrenched provisions as
well as of their removal from the articles of association. Section 24 also requires the company
to submit a statement of compliance with the entrenched provisions whenever it amends
its articles.
Third of all, as stated in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd[1900] 1 Ch 656 by Lindley
MR, there is the suggestion that members must exercise their votes â€˜bona fide for the benefit
of the company as a wholeâ€™. As such, this case would appear to indicate that the court jurisdiction to regard an alteration of the articles as invalid unless it is made for the benefit of the
company as a whole. The court does not in fact look solely at the company as it is at the time
of the action (which would be a subjective test) but tries to see the company in equilibrium.
That is to say the court envisages the company in a hypothetical situation in which shares and
voting power are evenly distributed among the members, and assumes that members will vote
independently of each other and not, as it were, combine to coerce other members. Having
viewed the company in this situation, the court then decides on the validity of the alteration.
This is an objective test and is really the only one the court can adopt. If it were to test the
validity of the alteration against the present state of the shareholding, then the day after the
resolution was approved the shareholding may alter and there may be a shift in the centre of
power in the company. Rather than cope with so many imponderables, the court decides the
question by putting the company into a state of equilibrium (hypothetically at least) and then
looking at the alteration.

The constitution of the company - altering the articles
However, the objective test is not altogether satisfactory and can sometimes operate unfavorably towards particular shareholders. The difficulty is that the court sometimes assumes,
probably rightly, that those who are managing the companyâ€™s affairs and, on occasion, a
majority of the shareholders, know better than the court what is for its benefit. Thus shareholders may sometimes feel that they have not been dealt with fairly and yet the court will
accept the alteration to the articles as valid and for the benefit of the company as a whole (see
Greenhalghv Arderne Cinemas).
Allenv Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd[1900] 1 Ch 656
The articles originally gave the company a lien on partly paid shares. The claimant was the only
member with fully paid shares but he also owed calls on certain other partly paid shares which he
owned. The company altered its articles to give itself a lien on fully paid shares, thus putting itself
in a position where it could refuse to transfer the claimantâ€™s fully paid shares unless and until he
had paid calls owing on his partly paid shares. It was held that the alteration was valid and for the
benefit of the company, even though the claimant was the only person practically affected at the
time by the alteration. Lindley MR stated:
Wide as the language of [s 33 Companies Act 2006] is, the power conferred by it must, like all other
powers, be exercised subject to those general principles of law and equity which are applicable to all
powers conferred on majorities and enabling them to bind minorities. It must be exercised, not only
in the manner required by law, but also bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole, and it
must not be exceeded. These conditions are always implied, and are seldom, if ever, expressed. But
if they are complied with I can discover no ground for judicially putting any other restrictions on the
power conferred by the section than those contained in it.
While this would initially appear to question the bona fides of the company, given the fact that only
one shareholder was affected by this alteration of the articles, it is important to realise that the
altered articles were intended to apply to all holders of fully paid shares, it just so happened that
the complaining shareholder was the only holder of fully paid-up shares at that time who was in
arrears of calls.
Greenhalghv Arderne Cinemas Ltd[1951] Ch 286
The articles of the company originally required any member who wished to sell his shares to offer
them to his fellow members before selling them to a stranger. A majority group of the shareholders
procured an alteration enabling a member to sell his shares without first offering them to his
fellow members if the company so resolved by ordinary resolution. The purpose was so that the
majority could sell their shares to an outsider, a Mr Sheckman, for 6s per share and so give
Mr Sheckman a controlling interest. Mr Greenhalgh, a minority shareholder, objected to the alteration although Mr Sheckman was prepared to pay 6s per share to any shareholder of the company, including Mr Greenhalgh.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that the alteration was valid even though its immediate effect was
to enable the majority group to sell their shares to outsiders without first offering them to the minority shareholders, though the minority shareholders, not being able to pass an ordinary resolution,
were still bound to offer their shares to the majority group before selling elsewhere.

Chapter 5 The constitution of the company - altering the articles
(i) Perhaps the alteration of the articles could be justified in this case under the objective test
adopted by the courts since the hypothetical member might benefit equally with any other member in the future by the extension of his power to sell his shares to strangers. Furthermore, the
alteration represented a relaxation of the very stringent restrictions on transfer in the article which
had existed before the change.
(ii) In earlier litigation between the same parties [1946] 1 All ER 512 what would now be 10p ordinary shares had one vote per share and so did each 50p ordinary share. Greenhalgh held 10p
shares and controlled 40 per cent of the vote and could block special resolutions. The holders of
the 50p shares procured an ordinary resolution (as company legislation requires), to subdivide
each 50p share into five 10p shares with one vote each, thus reducing Gâ€™s voting power. It was
held that the voting rights of the original 10p shares had not been varied. They still had one vote
per share.
The result of the objective test which the court uses is that most alterations are allowed,
though if the court feels that a decision is oppressive of the minority then it may set aside such
a resolution (Clemens vClemens Bros Ltd [1976] 2 All ER 268).
Clemensv Clemens Bros Ltd[1976] 2 All ER 268
A majority shareholder in a company has not an unfettered right to vote in any way he pleases; that
right must be exercised fairly and so as not to cause injustice to other shareholders. The plaintiff
held 45 per cent of the issued share capital of a family company, the remaining 55 per cent being
held by her aunt, who was also a director of the company. A scheme was proposed by the directors whereby the companyâ€™s issued share capital would be increased and some new shares would
be issued to the directors (other than the aunt) the balance being placed on trust for long-service
employees. The effect of the scheme was that the plaintiffâ€™s shareholding would be reduced to
under 25 per cent. Despite the plaintiffâ€™s objections, the scheme was approved, by reason of the
auntâ€™s majority shareholding. The plaintiff thereupon sought to have the restrictions set aside as
oppressive of her. Foster J noted:
There are many cases which have discussed a directorâ€™s position. A director must not only act within
his powers but must also exercise them bona fide in what he believes to be the interests of the company. The directors have a fiduciary duty, but is there any similar restraint on shareholders exercising
their powers as members at general meeting?...
I think that one thing which emerges...is that in such a case as the present Miss Clemens is not
entitled to exercise her majority vote in whatever way she pleases. The difficulty is in finding a principle, and obviously expressions such as â€˜bona fide for the benefit of the company as a wholeâ€™, fraud
on a â€˜minorityâ€™ and â€˜oppressiveâ€™ do not assist in formulating a principle.
I have come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to try to produce a principle, since the circumstances of each case are infinitely varied. It would not, I think, assist to say more than that in my
judgment Miss Clemens is not entitled as of right to exercise her votes as an ordinary shareholder in
any way she pleases. To use the phrase of Lord Wilberforce [Ebrahimi vWestborne Galleries Ltd],
that right is â€˜subject...to equitable considerations...which may make it unjust...to exercise it in
a particular wayâ€™.
Held- Setting aside the resolutions, that whatever other purposes there may have been behind the
scheme, there was an irresistible inference that it was designed in order to diminish the plaintiffâ€™s
voting rights; that accordingly the aunt had used her majority voting power inequitably.

The constitution of the company - altering the articles
Similarly, alterations which give the company power to expel members without cause are not
acceptable to the court. However, expulsion is allowed where it would benefit the members as
a whole, as where the member expelled is competing with the company or defrauding it.
Dafen Tinplate Co Ltdv Llanelly Steel Co (1907) Ltd[1920] 2 Ch 124
The principal shareholders of the defendant company were other steel companies, and it was
hoped that the member companies would buy their steel bars from the defendants, though
there was no contract to this effect. In the main the member companies did buy their steel from
the defendants, but the claimant company began in 1912 to get its steel from a concern called
the Bynea company in which the claimant had an interest. The defendant company then sought
to alter its articles to expel the claimant company. The alteration provided that the defendant
company could by ordinary resolution require any member to sell his shares to the other members
at a fair price to be fixed by the directors. The claimant sought a declaration that the alteration
Held- by Peterson J - that the claimant company was entitled to such a declaration. The power
taken by the articles was a bare power of expulsion, and could be used to expel a member who
was not acting to the detriment of the defendant company at all. Therefore, whatever its merits in
the circumstances of the case, it could not be allowed.
This power of expulsion was to be written in the articles and would last indefinitely. In addition, it
would permanently discriminate between shareholders of the same class and as such could not
benefit the future hypothetical member and was therefore void.
Sidebottomv Kershaw, Leese & Co[1920] 1 Ch 154
The defendant company, which was a small private company, altered its articles to empower the
directors to require any member who carried on a business competing with that of the company,
to sell his shares at a fair price to persons nominated by the directors. The claimant was a member of the defendant company, and ran mills in competition with it, and this action was brought to
test the validity of the alteration in articles. The court of first instance found for the claimant,
regarding the alteration as a bare power of expropriation, though there was no dispute that the
price fixed for the purchase of the shares was fair.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that the evidence showed that the claimant might cause the defendant company loss by information which he received as a member, and as the power was
restricted to expulsion for competing, the alteration was for the benefit of the company as a whole
and was valid.
(i) It was obviously in the interest of the company as a whole and of the â€˜hypothetical memberâ€™ that
the companyâ€™s trade secrets should not be available to its competitors.
(ii) As Lord Sterndale MR made clear in his judgment in this case, the power of compulsory purchase of shares is valid if contained in the original articles. Such a provision would not be set aside
on the â€˜benefitâ€™ ground; the concept is applicable only to changes in the articles as Phillips v
Manufacturersâ€™ Securities Ltd(1917) 116 LT 290 decides.

Chapter 5 The constitution of the company - altering the articles
(iii)Lord Sterndale MR also made the following comment:
Now it does not seem to me to matter as to the validity of this altered article, whether it was introduced with a view to using it against the plaintiff firm or not, except to this extent, that it might be that
if it had been introduced specifically for the purpose of using it against the plaintiffsâ€™ firm some question of bona fides might possibly have arisen, because it might have been argued that it was introduced to do them harm, and not to do the company good [...] I come to the conclusion that the
directors were acting perfectly bona fide; that they were passing the resolution for the benefit of the
company; but that no doubt the occasion of their passing it was because they realised in the person
of Mr Bodden that it was a bad thing to have members who were competing with them.
Shuttleworthv Cox Brothers & Co (Maidenhead) Ltd[1927] 2 KB 9
The companyâ€™s articles provided that Shuttleworth and four other persons should be permanent
directors of the company, to hold office for life, unless disqualified by any one of the events
specified in Art 22 of the companyâ€™s articles. These events were bankruptcy, insanity, conviction
of an indictable offence, failure to hold the necessary qualification shares, and being absent from
meetings of the board for more than six months without leave. The company conducted a building business, and Shuttleworth, on 22 occasions within 12 months, failed to account for the companyâ€™s money which he had received on its behalf. The articles were altered by adding another
disqualifying event, namely, a request in writing by all the other directors. Having made the alteration, the directors made the request to Shuttleworth, and he now questioned the validity of his
expulsion from the board.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that the alteration and the action taken under it was valid, because
it was for the benefit of the company as a whole since Shuttleworth was defrauding it. Shuttleworth
also claimed that no alteration of the articles could affect his contract with the company, but the
Court of Appeal held, on this point, that since part of his contract (the grounds for dismissal) was
contained in the articles, he must be taken to know that this was in an alterable document and he
must take the risk of change.
However, there are also cases which would appear to run contrary to the Allen vGold Reefs
â€˜bona fideâ€™ principle:North- West Transportation Co v Beatty(1887) 12 App Cas 589; Burlandv
Earle [1902] AC 83; Goodfellow v Nelson Line [1912] 2 Ch 324. (See also: Northern Counties
Securities Ltd vJackson & Steeple Ltd[1974] 1 WLR 1133 below.) In these instances, the courts
have stated that votes are proprietary rights which the owner may exercise according to his own
interests, even though these may run contrary to the interests of the company itself. Consequently,
it is important to note that the shareholdersâ€™ power to vote is not to be likened to the power exercised by directors which is in turn fiduciary in nature. Rather, shareholders are free to vote in whatever manner they wish to do so.
The issue is rather one whereby such proprietary rights are subject to review by the courts so
as to ensure that a majority does not exploit its position against a minority within the company.
In other words, the courts are adopting a very fine balance between respecting the freedom of
shareholders to use their proprietary rights within the context of majority rule in the company,
while at the same time ensuring that this system does not lead to an abuse of position or exploitation of minority shareholders. Indeed, this is reflected in Lord Hoffmanâ€™s discussion of the area in
the recent Privy Council case of Citco Banking Corporation NVv Pusserâ€™s Ltd[2007] UKPC 13,
in which he approved passages from both Allen v Gold Reefs as well as Shuttleworth v Cox
and emphasised the subjective nature of the bona fide test and stated that the court is only
justified in interfering when there is evidence impugning the honesty of the shareholders or where

The constitution of the company - altering the articles
no reasonable shareholder could consider the proposed amendment to be beneficial to the
company. (For further discussion on this point see Williams (2007) â€˜Bona Fide in the Interest of
Certaintyâ€™, CLJ 500.)
Fourthly, where the rights of different classes of shareholders are contained in the articles, then,
as noted above, s 33 would appear to permit these rights to be changed by way of a special resolution of the members of the company. However, this is another area in which the law aims to
protect minorities within a company from the potential oppression of majority rule. As such, the
general principle is that rights attaching to a class of shares should not be altered by the holders
of another class of shares without gaining the consent of the class in question for the alteration to
take place. This is covered by s 630 of the Companies Act 2006 which states that rights attached
to a class of a companyâ€™s shares may only be varied (a) in accordance with provision in the companyâ€™s articles for the variation of those rights; or (b) where no such provision exists then by way
of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of that class sanctioning the variation, or by consent in writing (s 630(2),(4)).
It should also be noted that according to s 633, the holders of not less than 15 per cent of the
issued shares of the class, who did not vote for the variation, may apply to the court within 21 days
of the consent of the class being given, whether in writing or by resolution, to have the variation
cancelled. Once such an application has been made, usually by one or more dissentients on behalf
of the others, the variation will not take effect unless and until it is confirmed by the court.
âž¨ See p. 144 As will be examined further in Chapter 7 âž¨, an issue which is frequently explored is whether
the issue of further shares, which do not remove the current rights of a particular class but simply
enjoy the same rights as the existing ones (effectively expanding the class and, as such, diluting
the voting power of the original holders of that class of shares), may amount to a variation of class
rights; White v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd [1953] Ch 65. This is also an area in which s 633 may
prove useful to those shareholders who suddenly find their position diluted within a particular class
and outvoted on a s 630 resolution.
Northern Counties Securities Ltdv Jackson & Steeple Ltd
[1974] 1 WLR 1133
The defendant company has agreed to use its best endeavours to allot a certain number of
shares to the plaintiffs resulting from a Stock Exchange quotation for its shares. However, it was
necessary for the company to gain consent via its General Meeting. After a period of inactivity
the plaintiffs successfully gained an order from the court against the company. Nevertheless,
the court emphasised that fact that even though a General Meeting must be called, together
with a circular inviting members to support the resolution, the members could not be compelled to
vote in favour of the resolution and would not be in contempt of court if they opposed it. Per
Walton LJ:
Mr Price argued that, in effect, there are two separate sets of persons in whom authority to activate
the company itself resides. Quoting the well known passages from Viscount Haldane L.C. in
Lennardâ€™s Carrying Co Ltd vAsiatic Petroleum Co Ltd[1915] AC 705, he submitted that the company as such was only a juristic figment of the imagination, lacking both a body to be kicked and a
soul to be damned. From this it followed that there must be some one or more human persons who
did, as a matter of fact, act on behalf of the company, and whose acts therefore must, for all practical
purposes, be the acts of the company itself. The first of such bodies was clearly the body of directors,
to whom under most forms of articles - see article 80 of Table A, or article 86 of the defendant
companyâ€™s articles which is in similar form - the management of the business of the company is
expressly delegated. Therefore, their acts are the defendant companyâ€™s acts; and if they do not, in the

Chapter 5 The constitution of the company - altering the articles
present instance, cause the defendant company to comply with the undertakings given by it to the
court, they are themselves liable for contempt of court. And this, he says, is well recognised: see RSC,
Ord. 45, r 5 (1), whereunder disobedience by a corporation to an injunction may result directly in the
issue of a writ of sequestration against any director thereof. It is of course clear that for this purpose
there is no distinction between an undertaking and an injunction: see note 45/5/3 in The Supreme
Court Practice (1973).
This is, indeed, all well established law, with which Mr Instone did not quarrel, and which indeed
his first proposition asserted. But, continues Mr Price, this is only half of the story. There are some
matters in relation to which the directors are not competent to act on behalf of the company. The relevant authority being â€˜the company in general meetingâ€™, that is to say, a meeting of the members.
Thus in respect of all matters within the competence - at any rate those within the exclusive competence - of a meeting of the members, the acts of the members are the acts of the company, in
precisely the same way as the acts of the directors are the acts of the company. Ergo, for any shareholder to vote against a resolution to issue the shares here in question to the plaintiffs would be a
contempt ofcourt, as it would be a step taken by him knowingly which would prevent the defendant
company from fulfilling its undertaking to the court. Mr Price admitted that he could find no authority
which directly assisted his argument, but equally confidently asserted that there was no authority
which precluded it.
Mr Instone indicted Mr Priceâ€™s argument as being based upon â€˜a nominalistic fallacyâ€™. His precise
proposition was formulated as follows: â€˜While directors have special responsibilities as executive
agents of the defendant company to ensure that the company does not commit a contempt of court,
a shareholder, when the position has been put before the shareholders generally, who chooses to
vote against such approval will not himself be in contempt of courtâ€™...
In my judgment, these submissions of Mr Instone are correct. I think that, in a nutshell, the distinction is this: when a director votes as a director for or against any particular resolution in a directorâ€™s
meeting, he is voting as a person under a fiduciary duty to the company for the proposition that
the company should take a certain course of action. When a shareholder is voting for or against a
particular resolution he is voting as a person owing no fiduciary duty to the company and who is exercising his own right of property, to vote as he thinks fit. The fact that the result of the voting at the
meeting (or at a subsequent poll) will bind the company cannot affect the position that, in voting, he
is voting simply in exercise of his own property rights.
Perhaps another (and simpler) way of putting the matter is that a director is an argent, who casts
his vote to decide in what manner his principal shall act through the collective agency of the board of
directors; a shareholder wh o casts his vote in general meeting is not casting it as an agent of the company in any shape or form. His act therefore, in voting as he pleases, cannot in any way be regarded
as an act of the company...
I now come to paragraph 4 of the notice of motion, which seeks an order restraining the individual
respondents and each of them from voting against the resolution. Mr Price says that, as the executive agents of the defendant company, they are bound to recommend to its shareholders that they
vote in favour of the resolution to issue the shares, and hence, at the least, they cannot themselves
vote against it, for they would thereby be assisting the defendant company to do that which it is their
duty to secure does not happen. If, as executive officers of the defendant company, they are bound
to procure a certain result if at all possible, how can they, as individuals, seek to frustrate that result?
I regret, however, that I am unable to accede to Mr Priceâ€™s arguments in this respect...I think
that a director who has fulfilled his duty as a director of a company, by causing it to comply with an
undertaking binding upon it is nevertheless free, as an individual shareholder, to enjoy the same unfettered and unrestricted right of voting at general meetings of the members of the company as he would
have if he were not also a director.
It is also worth bearing in mind the fact that a shareholder may have agreed to vote subject to
certain restrictions and/or guidelines contained in a separate contract. If this is the case then
the agreement is binding on the member and may be enforced by way of an injunction.

Breaches of contract arising out of alteration of the articles
Puddephattv Leith[1916] 1 Ch 200
The case involved the transaction of a loan of 2,500 l the payment of which, with interest at the
rate of 51/2per cent per annum, was secured to the defendant by an agreement under seal dated
14 February 1913, whereby the plaintiff transferred to the defendant by way of mortgage 2,500
fully-paid shares of 1 leach in a company called the London and Cosmopolitan Mining Company,
Limited. That mortgage was preceded by a collateral agreement which took the form of a letter
addressed by the defendant to the plaintiff in which the defendant said that the plaintiffâ€™s voting
rights in virtue of the shares held in mortgage by him during the period of the loan would be
untouched though the shares would be in his name and his voice might give the vote; that he
would give no such vote without consulting the plaintiff; and that he would vote in all cases where
a vote was necessary in respect of those shares as the plaintiff wished him to do. A general meeting
of the company was approaching, and the defendant threatened to vote as he thought fit in respect
of the shares and to disregard, as he had done once before, the plaintiffâ€™s expressed wishes on
this subject. As such, the plaintiff commenced this action in the Chancery Division claiming an
injunction to restrain the defendant from voting upon a poll at any meeting of the company in
respect of the 2,500 shares otherwise than in accordance with her directions. Per Sargent J:
In my opinion, therefore, the right of the plaintiff is clear, and the only remaining question is whether
she is entitled to a mandatory injunction to enforce her right. It is not disputed that she is entitled to
a prohibitive injunction, and in my opinion she is also entitled to a mandatory injunction. Prima facie
this court is bound...to give effect to a clear right by way of a mandatory injunction. There are no
doubt certain exceptions from this rule, as in the case of a contract of service, because in such cases,
it is impossible for the court to make its order effective, but...in the present case, in as much as
there is one definitive thing to be done, about the mode of doing which there can be no possible
doubt, I am of the opinion that I ought to grant not only the prohibitive but also the mandatory injunction claimed by the plaintiff, and I make an order accordingly.
Held- The Court ordered the defendant to comply with the undertaking.
Breaches of contract arising out of alteration of
the articles
A company cannot by altering its articles escape liability for breach of a contract into which
it has entered. The difficulty has arisen with regard to the remedies of the other party to the
contract. In Puntv Symons & Co Ltd[1903] 2 Ch 506 it was said that the other party to the
contract could sue the company for damages for breach, but could not obtain an injunction
to prevent the alteration taking effect. Then followed a series of cases which revealed considerable judicial indecision on this point. For example, in Baily v British Equitable Assurance
Co Ltd[1904] 1 Ch 374 the Court of Appeal seems to have been prepared to grant an injunction to restrain an alteration of the articles in breach of contract although in fact it was
only asked to give a declaratory judgment as to the state of the law. However, in Southern
Foundries v Shirlaw, 1940 (below), Lord Porter in an obiter dictum gave support to the view
that the other party to the contract can sue the company for damages only, and cannot obtain
an injunction to prevent the alteration from taking effect. It may be said, therefore, that a
company is quite free to alter its articles, though if in doing so it breaks a contract which it
has made, it must face an action in damages by the party aggrieved. There may also be an
action against those who voted for the alteration.

Chapter 5 The constitution of the company - altering the articles
Southern Foundries (1926) Ltdv Shirlaw[1940] AC 701
The appellant company was incorporated in 1926 as a private company, and was engaged in the
business of iron founders. The respondent, Shirlaw, became a director of the company in 1929
under a provision in the articles. In 1933 he became managing director under a separate contract,
the appointment to be for 10 years, and containing restraints under which Shirlaw agreed that he
would not, for a period of three years after leaving the employment of the appellants, engage in
foundry work within 100 miles of Croydon. In 1935 there was a merger between the appellant company and ten other concerns, and the group was called Federated Industries. The members of
the group agreed that they should make certain alterations in their articles regarding directors; the
articles of each member were altered, and in their new form gave Federated Industries power to
remove any director of the company, and also stipulated that a managing director should cease to
hold office if he ceased to be a director. In 1937 Shirlaw was removed from office as a director,
under the provision in the articles, by an instrument in writing, signed by two directors and the
secretary of Federated Industries. This meant that Shirlaw could no longer be managing director
of Southern Foundries, and since his contract had still some time to run, he brought this action
for wrongful dismissal. The trial judge found for Shirlaw and awarded him Â£12,000 damages, and
the Court of Appeal affirmed that decision. The company now appealed to the House of Lords.
Held - by a majority - that Shirlawâ€™s contract as managing director contained an implied term
that the article making him a director would not be altered. Since it had been altered, there was a
breach of contract and the company was liable for it. Lord Wright took the view that since there
was no privity of contract between Shirlaw and Federated Industries, it was difficult to see how
they could dismiss him. Lord Romer, dissenting, did not think a term against alteration of the
articles could be implied and thought that Shirlaw took the risk of alteration. Lord Porter lent support in this case to Punt v Symons, 1903, and said that a company could not be prevented by
injunction from altering its articles but that the only remedy for an alteration which has caused a
breach of contract was damages.
(i) From statements made in this case it appears that any member who votes for the alteration will
also be liable to the claimant for inducing the company to break its contract if the inevitable consequence of the alteration i s that the contract will be broken.
(ii) In Shirlawthe articles said that a managing director was to be subject to the same provisions
for removal as any other director â€˜subject to the provisions of any contract between him and the
companyâ€™. There was an implied term in the contract of service which overrode the power of
removal without compensation in the articles.
(iii) In Nelson v James Nelson & Sons Ltd [1914] 2 KB 770 a service contract appointing the
claimant to act as managing director â€˜so long as he shall remain a director of the companyâ€™ was
also held to override an article giving a power of removal without compensation. Damages were
awarded to the claimant because his contract was terminated by his removal from office as a
director. That was a breach by the company of his contract as managing director which he could
then no longer perform.
The position is different where a person contracts with a company and the contract incorporates a provision of the articles by implication. In such a case the other party is deemed
to know that the company may alter its articles, and therefore takes the risk of the contract
failing because of such an alteration, even to the extent of failing in an action for damages
(Shuttleworthv Cox Bros & Co (Maidenhead) Ltd, 1927, see above). However, there are certain limitations upon the above rule:

Alteration of the articles by the court
(a) Rights which have already accrued under the contract cannot be disturbed by the alteration.
Swabeyv Port Darwin Gold Mining Co(1889) 1 Meg 385
Swabey had served the company as a director under a provision in the companyâ€™s articles which
provided for his salary. The articles were altered so as to reduce that salary and it was held- by
the Court of Appeal - that, although the alteration was effective to reduce the salary for the future,
Swabey could not be deprived of his salary at the original figure for the period he had served prior
to the alteration of the articles. Lord Esher MR stated:
The articles do not themselves form a contract, but from them you get the terms upon which the
directors are serving. It would be absurd to hold that one of the parties to a contract could alter it as
to service already performed under it. The company has power to alter the articles, but the directors
would be entitled to their salary at the rate originally stated in the articles up to the time the articles
were altered.
(b) It is felt that the obligations of the other party cannot be made more onerous by an alteration of the articles. Thus, if the articles appoint a director to serve for a period of years
on a part-time basis, he cannot be required to give his full time to the company by the
company altering its articles so as to require him to do so.
(c) As we have already seen, where the company has shares of more than one class, it cannot
vary the rights of a class of shares merely by altering them in the memorandum or articles.
Section 630 applies and requires the consent of three-quarters of the class and there are
dissentient rights.
Alteration of the articles by the court
As discussed above, the articles are a contract between the company and each member and in
this connection the court has power to rectify contracts. For example, if parties have agreed
for a lease of land for 25 years that is written down in the lease by mistake as 21 years then if
one of the parties is not prepared to co-operate in changing this provision of the lease the
court can be asked to rectify the lease by an order inserting 25 years as the term of the lease
provided the evidence shows to the satisfaction of the court that this was the intention of the
parties. The court has ruled however that it does not have power to rectify the statutory contract set out in the articles.
Scottv Frank F Scott (London) Ltd[1940] Ch 794
The defendant company was a private company with three members, Frank, Stuart and Reginald
Scott, the business of the company being that of butchers. On the death of Frank Scott, his widow,
Marie Scott, became entitled under his will to certain preference shares and ordinary shares in the
company, as executrix. When she sought to be registered in respect of the shares, Stuart and
Reginald Scott claimed that under a provision in the articles the shares must on the death of a
member be offered to the other members at par, but the article was not so well drafted as to make
this clear beyond doubt. This action was brought to interpret the article, and also to ask the court to
rectify the article to carry a right to pre-emption if the article was not so drafted as to achieve this.

Chapter 5 The constitution of the company - altering the articles
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that the article did give the right of pre-emption claimed by Stuart
and Reginald Scott. However, if it had not done so, the court could not have rectified it; the alteration could only be carried out by special resolution.
However, the High Court departed from this general ruling when faced with an absurd result
of bad drafting.
Folkes Group plcv Alexander[2002] 2 BCLC 254
The Folkes family held a substantial proportion of the voting shares in the listed plc. The other
shareholders had no voting rights unless the Folkes family holdings fell below 40 per cent. An article
to ensure that this could never happen was drafted and agreed and became part of the articles. Later
it was noticed that certain holdings of the Folkes family were excluded from the voting category so
that their voting holdings fell to 23.9 per cent, thus triggering the voting rights of the other members. The former non-voting shares would not use their newly acquired voting power to change the
articles to what was originally intended. The court did however do so by ordering the insertion of
five words into the altered article to give it the effect intended. The judgeâ€™s justification was that to
leave the article as it was would flout business common sense and legal decisions might on occasion have to yield to business common sense following comments in the House of Lords in
Investors Compensation Scheme LtdvWest Bromwich Building Society[1998] 1 BCLC 493.

The company and its contracts

Public companies and the s 761 certificate
Acompany necessarily contracts through agents such as its directors and other officers, and
senior employees. This chapter is, in the main, concerned with the problems which can
arise when these agents enter into transactions which they are not authorised to make or use
their powers for an improper purpose, or exercise them by irregular procedures. First, however, this is an appropriate place to deal with transactions entered into by public companies
before receipt of a s 761 certificate from the Registrar.
Public companies and the s 761 certificate
Under s 761 a public company, registered as such on its initial incorporation, cannot commence business or exercise any borrowing powers unless the Registrar has issued what is
known as a s 761 trading certificate. A private company does not require such a certificate.
The trading certificate will be issued when the Registrar is satisfied that the nominal
value of the companyâ€™s allotted share capital is at least Â£50,000 (s 763) and not less than
one-quarter of the nominal value of each issued share in the company plus the whole of any
premium on such shares has been received by the company, whether in cash or otherwise.
A share allotted in pursuance of an employeesâ€™ share scheme may not be taken into account
in determining the nominal value of the companyâ€™s allotted share capital unless it is paid up
at least as to one-quarter of the nominal value of the share and the whole of any premium on
the share.
In order to obtain a s 761 certificate, the company must file with the Registrar a statement
of compliance and application specifying the following items as detailed in s 762:
(a) that the nominal value of the companyâ€™s allotted share capital is not less than the authorised minimum;
(b) the amount, or estimated amount, of the preliminary expenses of the company and the
persons by whom any of those expenses have been paid or are payable; and
(c) any amount or benefit paid or given or intended to be paid or given to any promoter of
the company and th e consideration for the payment or benefit.
The object of the ss 761-762 provisions is to ensure that a plc has some significant starting
capital. The disclosure of preliminary expenses and promoter payments is required because
if these are large and paid from the initial capital, then the provision for a significant initial
capital is defeated.
When a trading certificate is issued it is conclusive evidence that the company is entitled to
commence business and exercise borrowing powers (s 761(4)). Failure to comply with s 761
may, according to s 767, result in a fine on the company and any officer in default.
If a public company has not obtained a s 761 certificate within a year of registration, the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may present a petition to the court to wind it up.
If a company does commence business or borrow without a s 761 certificate, transactions
with traders and lenders are nevertheless enforceable against the company. However, if the
company cannot meet its obligations in terms of payment of a debt or repayment of a loan
incurred during the period of unlawful trading, within 21 days of being called upon to do
so, the directors of the company are jointly and severally liable to indemnify the trader or
lender in respect of his loss resulting from the companyâ€™s failure to meet its obligations.
Therefore, s 767(3) leaves the company liable and the directors become personally liable if

Chapter 6 The company and its contracts
the company does not pay, as where it goes into insolvent liquidation without discharging its
liability on a transaction.
Directors and others as agents
If the board acting together (that is collectively), or one director or other officer of the
company acting on his own, has actual authority to make a particular contract on behalf of
the company, and that contract is within the companyâ€™s powers (or if not the transaction is
âž¨ See p. 78 protected by s 39 - see Chapter 3 âž¨), then the contract, when made, will be binding on the
company. However, where the directors act together, or as individuals, beyond their authority the position for them and other officers is as set out below.
Collective acts of the board
(a) The Companies Act 2006
Section 40(1) provides that in favour of a person dealing with the company in good faith, the
power of the board of directors to bind the company or authorise others to do so shall be
âž¨ See p. 334 deemed free of any limitation under the companyâ€™s constitution (see further Chapter 17 âž¨),
and a person shall not be regarded as acting in bad faith just because he knows that
an act is beyond the powers of the directors (s 40(2)(b)). In addition, under s 40(2)(b) there
is no duty to enquire as to the directorsâ€™ authority and there is no constructive notice of any
provision of the companyâ€™s constitution limiting authority. Therefore, provided the above
requirements are met, a transaction entered into by the board beyond its powers will bind the
company. This applies not only where the directors are acting beyond their powers but also
where they are within their powers but have failed to observe proper internal procedures.
TCBv Gray[1987] 3 WLR 1144
A company issued a debenture to secure a loan. The transaction was within the companyâ€™s powers
and within the authority of the board. The debenture was issued under the companyâ€™s seal. On this
the articles of the company said â€˜every instrument to which the seal shall be affixed shall be signed
by a directorâ€™. In this case it was signed by a solicitor to whom one of the directors had given a
power of attorney to act as his agent. The question of the validity of the debenture arose and the
court held that it was valid under s 35A which protected not only against lack of authority but also
against the use of incorrect procedures.
In addition, it will be noted that the section deals with a situation where the directors
authorise other persons to make contracts on behalf of the company. This is to overcome the
common law rule that a company can only act through organs of the company. At common
law the board of directors is an organ of the company but only if acting collectively. Section
40(1) overcomes this by making it clear that an act done by a person authorised by the board
is in effect an act of the board and therefore an act by an organ of the company. For example,
if the board authorises the companyâ€™s purchasing officer to buy materials from outsiders for
use in the companyâ€™s manufacturing process, each purchase within the officerâ€™s authority will

Directors and others as agents
be a transaction decided upon by the directors and therefore a transaction decided upon by
a common law organ of the company. There is no longer an assumption as in previous legislation that all commercial decisions are made at boardroom level. If, therefore, the board collectively makes a decision and enters into a transaction which is beyond its powers, s 40 will
make the transaction enforceable, and the same is true if an individual authorised by the
board exceeds the powers of the directors by a contract which he as an authorised individual
Good faith. Under s 40(2)(b) a person is to be regarded as acting in good faith unless the
contrary is proved. Thus the burden of proof will be on the company if it wishes to avoid a
transaction on the â€˜bad faithâ€™ ground.
Member injunctions. A member of a company is not prevented by s 40 from asking the
court for an injunction to stop the directors from acting beyond their powers, but this cannot be done if the transaction has been entered into (see s 40(4)).
Director liability. The directors are liable to compensate the company as they always have
been if they cause the company loss by acting outside their powers (s 40(5)).
Section 40: use by shareholders. The section has been viewed as essentially an outsiderâ€™s
protection as where a creditor relies on the section to validate a contract entered into by the
directors without authority. However, in the following case it was held to be available to
shareholders in regard to a disputed issue of bonus shares.
EIC Services Ltdv Phipps[2003] 3 All ER 804
A shareholder in the company challenged a bonus issue of shares that it had made by capitalising
the sum standing to the credit of its share premium account because, if his claim had succeeded,
he would have owned a substantially greater proportion of the company. The challenge was based
upon the companyâ€™s articles which provided that the bonus shares should be applied in proportion to the amounts paid up on the shares and following an ordinary resolution of the members.
The contention was that a very substantial number of the bonus shares were issued to shareholders
whose shares were not paid up and that no resolution of members was passed but only a resolution of the board. The High Court ruled, however, that the bonus issue was enforceable. The relevant shareholders were entitled to rely on the CA 1985, s 35A (now s 40 of the Companies Act
2006) which provides that, in favour of a person dealing with the company in good faith, the power
of the board of directors to bind the company or authorise others to do so shall be deemed free
of any limitation under the companyâ€™s constitution, e.g. its articles. Regarding the fact that certain
of the recipients of the bonus shares were directors, the judge referred to the further provisions of
what is now s 40 which state that a person shall not be regarded as acting in bad faith because
he knows that the act is beyond the powers of the directors. The judge felt that they did not know
that the issue of the bonus shares was beyond their powers, though as directors they should have
done. In any case, the judge felt that they had acted in good faith. The issue of all the bonus shares
was therefore valid.
The issue was also challenged on the ground that the directors made it under a misapprehension
of their powers. The contract for the shares, therefore, was void at common law for operative mistake. The court rejected this on the grounds that the mistake was not sufficiently fundamental to
avoid the contract.

Chapter 6 The company and its contracts
Section 40: use by directors. Section 40 states that it applies â€˜in favour of a person dealing
with the company in good faithâ€™. The matter of whether a director could claim to be included
in the word â€˜personâ€™ arose in the following case.
Smithv Henniker-Major & Co (a Firm)[2002] All ER (D) 310 (Jul)
A director of a company who was in dispute with the other directors wished to bring a claim by the
company against the defendant solicitors. The company was not pursuing the claim. The director,
believing that he had power under the companyâ€™s articles, acted alone and, without a quorate
board meeting, made an agreement as agent of the company under which the companyâ€™s claim
against the solicitors was assigned to him personally. The assignment was later ratified by deed,
presumably to prevent a ruling that the assignment was ineffective as lacking consideration. On
the issue of the authority of the director to make the assignment for the company, the solicitors
contended that since the companyâ€™s board did not hold a quorate meeting the assignment was
invalid and ineffective, so the claimantâ€™s case against them should not proceed. On the question
whether a director of the company could claim to be included in the word â€˜personâ€™ in what is now
s 40, the majority of the Court of Appeal said no. The words were wide enough to cover a director
but not in this case. The claimant, Mr Smith, was the chairman of the company and it was his duty
to see that the companyâ€™s constitution was adhered to. The articles did not permit him to turn himself into a one-man board and he could not rely on his own error as to the companyâ€™s constitution
to validate a transaction with himself. His appeal against a decision striking out his claim against
the defendants was dismissed.
It may be that a director not so senior as Mr Smith but, say, a more junior director - perhaps only
recently appointed - might have succeeded. The decision does not rule this out.
(b) The rule in Turquandâ€™s case: the indoor management rule
This rule is best explained by looking straightaway at the facts of the case (below).
Royal British Bankv Turquand(1856) 6 E & B 327
The claimant bank lent Â£2,000 to a joint stock company called Cameronâ€™s Coalbrook Steam
Coal & Swansea and London Railway Company, which was at the time of the action in course of
winding-up. Turquand was the general manager of the company and was brought into the action
to represent it. The company had issued a bond under its common seal, signed by two directors,
agreeing to repay the loan. The registered deed of settlement of the company (which corresponded
to the articles of a modern company) provided that the directors might borrow on bond such sums
as they should be authorised by a general resolution of the members of the company to borrow.
In the case of this loan it appeared that no such resolution had been passed.
Held - by the Court of Exchequer - that the bond was nevertheless binding on the company,
because the lenders were entitled to assume that a resolution authorising the borrowing had been
passed. There was no need to go indoors the management to make active enquiries.
This case succeeded because the ordinary resolution involved did not have to be filed with the
Registrar of Companies. Therefore, there was no constructive notice of it. During the period when
there was constructive notice of a companyâ€™s memorandum and articles and the contents of its

Directors and others as agents
file at the Registry, it was decided that Turquand could not apply where the resolution required
was a special or extraordinary resolution because these have to be filed and an outsider would
have constructive notice that they had not been. The relevant decision is Irvinev Union Bank of
Australia(1877) 2 App Cas 366.
Since the enactment of the Companies Act 2006, s 40 and the abolition of constructive notice,
the importance of the rule in Turquandâ€™s case should now be diminished.
(c) The relationship between s 40 and the rule in Turquandâ€™s case
Section 40 gives the same protection as Turquandin regard to unauthorised collective acts of
the board and also where correct internal procedures were not followed as in TCB vGray,
1987 (above).
While one could argue that Turquandâ€™s case would appear to be wider than s 35A under the
Companies Act 1985, because it applied to make a transaction by the company enforceable
against it in Mahoney vEast Holyford Mining Co (1875) LR 7 HL 869, where the directors
who made the transaction had never been appointed at all, and again in Davis v R Bolton
& Co[1894] 3 Ch 678 the rule was applied where the directors made a transfer of shares without a quorum at the meeting. The transfer was nevertheless held to be valid. This position has
now been affected by the new wording of s 40 (Companies Act 2006), which refers to any â€˜limitation under the companyâ€™s constitutionâ€™ on the power of the board to bind the company.
Although s 40 has not been fully interpreted by the courts, it seems logical to suppose that
it would not apply in the circumstances of either Mahoney or Davis because the court will
presumably expect that when an English statute says â€˜the power of the directors to bind the
companyâ€™ it means directors who are properly appointed and have a quorum at the relevant
meeting. Until s 40 has been more fully interpreted, it is perhaps safer to assume that
Turquandâ€™s case still has a role to play.
(d) The proper purpose rule
The directors must use their agency powers for the proper purpose, that is, for the benefit of
âž¨ See p. 379 the company and which is now outlined in s 171, CA 2006 (see Chapter 19 âž¨). If they do not
do so, the transactions w hich they have entered into, while not ultra viresthemselves or the
company, are not enforceable against the company provided that the person with whom the
directors dealt was aware of the improper use of the power.
Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltdv British Steel Corporation
[1985] 2 WLR 908
A Mr Shenkman was a 51 per cent shareholder and director in Rolled Steel and held all the issued
share capital in another company called Scottish Steel of which he was also a director. Scottish
Steel owed a lot of money to BSC and Mr Shenkman had given his personal guarantee of that
debt. Later BSC wanted more security and Mr S caused Rolled Steel to enter into a guarantee of
the Scottish Steel debt. There was no benefit to Rolled Steel in this and BSC knew there was not.
The Court of Appeal decided that BSC could not enforce the guarantee. The transaction was
not ultra vires Rolled Steel because its objects clause contained a paragraph giving an express
âž¨ See p. 79 power to enter into guarantees (see Chapters 3 and 4 âž¨). However, the power of the directors to
bind the company as agents was a different matter. Mr Shenkman and the other director of Rolled
Steel, Mr Shenkmanâ€™s father, had exercised their powers of giving guarantees for an improper purpose (i.e. a purpose which was of no benefit to the company). The guarantee could therefore be

Chapter 6 The company and its contracts
avoided by the liquidator of Rolled Steel provided that those to whom it was given were aware of
the improper purpose. Since BSC knew that there was no benefit to Rolled Steel in the guarantee,
it could not enforce the guarantee and prove in the liquidation.
(i) If BSC had not been on notice of the circumstances in which Rolled Steel had been made to
enter into the guarantee, it could have claimed in the liquidation.
(ii) It should be noted that if the members of Rolled Steel had passed an ordinary resolution
ratifying the making of the guarantee, then it would have been enforceable against the company.
Where the directors act for an improper purpose, this can be put right by an ordinary resolution of
the members even if, as here, the â€˜wrongdoerâ€™ can himself obtain an ordinary resolution. This
would not apply if the â€˜wrongdoerâ€™ acted fraudulently, which was not the case here.
Acts of individual directors and other officers of the company
We must now consider the extent to which a company will be bound by a transaction entered
into by an individual director or other officer, e.g. the company secretary, who has no actual
authority to enter into it. There are the following possibilities:
(a) The Companies Act 2006
As we have seen, s 40 states that in favour of a person dealing with a company in good faith
the power of the directors to authorise other persons to bind the company shall be regarded
as free from any limitation under the companyâ€™s constitution. Therefore, an individual director, company secretary, employee or other agent, authorised by the directors to bind the
company, will do so even if he exceeds the powers given to the board itself or other agents of
the company by the articles. Once again, knowledge of the lack of power in the individual
making the transaction on behalf of the company is not bad faith and does not prevent the
transaction from binding the company.
(b) The rules of agency: the doctrine of holding out
Where a director or other officer of a company has no actual authority, or authorisation
under s 40, an outsider may be able to regard a transaction entered into by such an individual as binding on the company if the person with whom he negotiated was held out by the
company as having authority to enter into it, in regard to all commercial activities relating to
the running of the business.
Since it is usual to delegate wide powers to a managing director and other executive directors, and Table A (replaced by the new Model Articles in newly incorporated companies)
allows the board to delegate widely to such persons, an outsider will normally be protected
and the transaction will bind the company if he has dealt with a managing director or other
executive director (e.g. a sales director) or other officer (e.g. the company secretary) and this
applies even if the person concerned has not actually been appointed to the post.
Freeman & Lockyerv Buckhurst Park Properties Ltd[1964] 1 All ER 630
A Mr Kapoor carried on a business as a property developer, and entered into a contract to buy
an estate called Buckhurst Park at Sunninghill. He did not have enough money to pay for it, and
obtained financial assistance from a Mr Hoon. They formed a limited company with a share capital

Directors and others as agents
of Â£70,000, subscribed equally by Kapoor and Hoon, to buy the estate with a view to selling it for
development. Kapoor and Hoon, together with two other persons, comprised the board of directors. The quorum of the board was four, and Hoon was at all material times abroad. There was
a power under the articles to appoint a managing director but this was never done. Kapoor, to the
knowledge of the board, acted as if he were managing director in relation to finding a purchaser
for the estate; and again, without express authority of the board but with its knowledge, he
employed on behalf of the company a firm of architects and surveyors, the claimants in this case,
for the submission of an application for planning permission which involved preparing plans and
defining the estate boundaries. The claimants now claimed from the company the fees for the work
done, and the companyâ€™s defence was that Kapoor had no authority to act for the company. The
Court of Appeal found that the company was liable, and Diplock LJ said that four conditions must
be fulfilled before a third party was entitled to enforce against a company a contract entered into
on its behalf by an agent without actual authority to make it:
(a) A representation must be made to the third party that the agent had authority. This condition
was satisfied here because the board knew that Kapoor was making the contract as managing director but did not stop him.
(b) The representation must be made by the persons who have actual authority to manage the
company. This condition was satisfied because the articles conferred full powers of management on the board.
(c) The third party must have been induced to make the contract because of the representation.
This condition was satisfied because the claimants relied on Kapoorâ€™s authority and thought
they were dealing with the company.
(d) Under the memorandum and articles the company is not deprived of the capacity either to
make a contract of the kind made or to delegate authority to an agent to make the contract.
This condition was satisfied because the articles allowed the board to delegate any of its functions of management to a managing director or a single director.
The court also decided that although the claimants had not looked at the articles, this did not
matter: for the rule does not depend upon estoppel arising out of a document, but on estoppel
by representation.
Hely-Hutchinsonv Brayhead[1968] 1 QB 549
Under the articles of the company the directors were empowered to decide who should draw bills
of exchange on behalf of the company. A Mr Clarke, who was the Manchester branch manager of
Schenkers, drew bills of exchange on the companyâ€™s behalf in favour of Kreditbank. He had no
authority to do so. The court later held that the bills were not binding on the company because it
was, on the evidence, unusual for a branch manager.
Richards, the chairman of the defendant company, Brayhead, acted as its de facto managing
director. He was the chief executive who made the final decision on any matters concerning
finance. He often committed the company to contracts without the knowledge of the board and
reported the matter afterwards. The board knew of and acquiesced in that. In July 1964 the plaintiff, the chairman and managing director of a public company, Perdio, gave a personal guarantee
to bankers for a loan of Â£50,000 to Perdio. Towards the end of 1964 Perdio was sustaining losses
and needed financial assistance. Brayhead was prepared to help, with the intention eventually to
obtain control of Perdio. In January 1965 Brayhead bought 750,000 Perdio ordinary shares from the
plaintiff for over Â£100,000 and proposed to inject Â£150,000 into Perdio. About the same time the
plaintiff became a director of Brayhead, but did not attend any board meetings until 19 May 1965.
After that meeting, in an office outside, in a discussion between Richards and the plaintiff, the

Chapter 6 The company and its contracts
plaintiff agreed to put more money into Perdio if Brayhead would secure his position. To that
end Richards, on behalf of Brayhead, as chairman signed two letters on Brayheadâ€™s paper dated
19 May 1965, and addressed to the plaintiff. In one Brayhead purported to indemnify the plaintiff
against loss on his personal guarantee of Â£50,000 and in the other Brayhead purported to
guarantee to repay money lent by the plaintiff personally to Perdio. In reliance on those letters the
plaintiff advanced Â£45,000 to Perdio.
Article 99 of Brayheadâ€™s articles of association provided that â€˜A director may contract with and
be interested in any contract...with the company...and shall not be liable to account for any
profit made by him by reason of any such contract...provided that the nature of the interest of
the director in such contract...be declared at a meeting of the directors as required by...section 199 of the Companies Act, 1948â€™, but no disclosure of the two contracts was in fact made to
the board.
Despite the plaintiffâ€™s and other advances by Brayhead, Perdioâ€™s financial position remained
hopeless and it went into liquidation. The plaintiff was called on to honour his guarantee. He paid
the bankers Â£50,000 and claimed that sum and the Â£45,000 lent to Perdio, from Brayhead.
Brayhead denied liability contending that Richards had no authority to sign the letters, alternatively,
that since the plaintiff had not disclosed his interest in the contracts as required by article 99 of
Brayheadâ€™s articles of association and section 199 of the Companies Act 1948, the contracts were
unenforceable.
Roskill J held that although Richards had no actual authority to enter into contracts, he had
ostensible or apparent authority to do so; that the plaintiffâ€™s breach of article 99 of Brayheadâ€™s
articles of association and section 199 of the Act of 1948, only rendered the contracts voidable,
not void or unenforceable; and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.
On appeal, Denning MR stated:
I need not consider at length the law on the authority of an agent, actual, apparent, or ostensible. That
has been done in the judgments of this court in Freeman & Lockyer vBuckhurst Park Properties
(Mangal) Ltd. It is there shown that actual authority may be express or implied. It is express when it
is given by express words, such as when a board of directors pass a resolution which authorises two
of their number to sign cheques. It is implied when it is inferred from the conduct of the parties and
the circumstances of the case, such as when the board of directors appoint one of their number to
be managing director. They thereby impliedly authorise him to do all such things as fall within the
usual scope of that office. Actual authority, express or implied, is binding as between the company
and the agent, and also as between the company and others, whether they are within the company
or outside it.
Ostensible or apparent authority is the authority of an agent as it appears to others. It often coincides with actual authority. Thus, when the board appoint one of their number to be managing director, they invest him not only with implied authority, but also with ostensible authority to do all such
things as fall within the usual scope of that office. Other people who see him acting as managing
director are entitled to assume that he has the usual authority of a managing director. But sometimes
ostensible authority exceeds actual authority. For instance, when the board appoint the managing
director, they may expressly limit his authority by saying he is not to order goods worth more than
Â£500 without the sanction of the board. In that case his actual authority is subject to the Â£500 limitation, but his ostensible authority includes all the usual authority of a managing director. The company
is bound by his ostensible authority in his dealings with those who do not know of the limitation. He
may himself do the â€˜holding-outâ€™. Thus, if he orders goods worth Â£1,000 and signs himself â€˜Managing
Director for and on behalf of the companyâ€™, the company is bound to the other party who does not
know of the Â£500 limitation, see British Thomson-Houston Co Ltd vFederated European Bank Ltd,
which was quoted for this purpose by Pearson LJ in Freeman & Lockyer. Even if the other party happens himself to be a director of the company, nevertheless the company may be bound by the ostensible authority. Suppose the managing director orders Â£1,000 worth of goods from a new director who
has just joined the company and does not know of the Â£500 limitation, not having studied the minute

Directors and others as agents
book, the company may yet be bound. Lord Simonds in Morris v Kanssen, envisaged that sort of
case, which was considered by Roskill J in the present case.
Apply these principles here. It is plain that Mr Richards had no express authority to enter into these
two contracts an behalf of the company: nor had he any such authority implied from the nature of his
office. He had been duly appointed chairman of the company but that office in itself did not carry with
it authority to enter into these contracts without the sanction of the board. But I think he had authority implied from the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case. The judge did not rest
his decision on implied authority, but I think his findings necessarily carry that consequence. The
judge finds that Mr Richards acted as de facto managing director of Brayhead. He was the chief executive who made the final decision on any matter concerning finance. He often committed Brayhead
to contracts without the knowledge of the board and reported the matter afterwards. The judge said
â€˜I have no doubt that Mr Richards was, by virtue of his position as de facto managing director of
Brayhead or, as perhaps one might more compendiously put it, as Brayheadâ€™s chief executive, the
man who had, in Diplock LJâ€™s words, â€œactual authority to manageâ€, and he was acting as such
when he signed those two documents.â€™ And later he said: â€˜The board of Brayhead knew of and acquiesced in Mr Richards acting as de facto managing director of Brayhead.â€™ The judge held that
Mr Richards had ostensible or apparent authority to make the contract, but I think his findings carry
with it the necessary inference that he had also actual authority, such authority being implied from
the circumstance that the board by their conduct over many months had acquiesced in his acting
as their chief executive and committing Brayhead Ltd to contracts without the necessity of sanction
from the board.
Held- appeal dismissed but on the grounds that Richards had actual authority to bind his company.
Panorama Developments (Guildford) Ltdv Fidelis Furnishing Fabrics Ltd
[1971] 3 All ER 16
The claimant company trading as Belgravia Executive Car Rental sued the defendant company for
Â£570 in respect of car hiring. Belgravia had a fleet of Rolls Royce, Jaguar and other cars. Fidelis
was a company of good reputation which employed a new man, X, as its secretary. He got in touch
with Belgravia and booked cars which he wanted to drive for the company to meet important customers when they arrived at Heathrow Airport. On the first occasion, X wrote a cheque on his own
account and it was met. In January 1970 he gave a list of dates for which he required cars on hire
to Belgravia. It confirmed that the cars would be available and sent a written confirmation to Fidelis
and not to X. Belgravia allowed the cars to go out on credit, asking for references. X gave references of the company which proved to be satisfactory. The printed forms of hiring and insurance
agreements showed that X, the company secretary, was the hirer. These forms were signed by X
or the sales manager of Fidelis. X used the cars which were never paid for. Belgravia sent the statement of account to Fidelis but it did not pay. Later the managing director of Fidelis found many
unpaid bills in the companyâ€™s name and disputed Xâ€™s authority to act on behalf of the company.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that the defendant company was liable for the hire because, among
other things, X as company secretary had ostensible authority to enter into the contracts for the
hire of the cars on behalf of the defendant.
(i) The observations of Lord Denning on the position of a company secretary are of interest. He said:
He is no longer a mere clerk. He regularly makes representations on behalf of the company and enters
into contracts on its behalf which come within the day to day running of the companyâ€™s business.
So much so that he may be regarded as held out as having authority to do such things on behalf of

Chapter 6 The company and its contracts
the company. He is certainly entitled to sign contracts connected with the administrative side of the
companyâ€™s affairs such as employing staff and ordering cars and so forth.
(ii) It should be noted that the judges in this case referred to the power of the company secretary
to bind the company in this limited way as being based on ostensible authority. The reader should,
however, be aware that it is sometimes referred to as â€˜usualâ€™ authorityâ€™, i.e. being what, for example,
a managing director or company secretary can â€˜usually doâ€™.
Non-executive directors and employees
Where the outsider deals with a non-executive director or employee not occupying a designated office within the company-law structure, neither of whom have been authorised under
s 40, the position of the outsider is much less secure and there is little authority in case law
which deals with the ostensible or usual authority of middle and lower management: such as
there is would suggest that their unauthorised acts are unlikely to bind the company.
Of course, where the company allows an employee to hold himself out as an executive
director, he may assume the actual ostensible or usual authority of such a director in regard
to an outsider who is not aware of the true position, as the following case illustrates.
Electronics Ltdv Akhter Computers Ltd[2001] 1 BCLC 433
Mr David Bennett was employed by Skynet, a division of Akhter, as â€˜director PSU salesâ€™. In fact,
he was not a director of any company in the Akhter Group. He worked from a small sales office in
Basingstoke with two other people, his assistant Andy Wall and a secretary. Mr Bennettâ€™s primary
duty was to promote sales and he was paid large commissions when he was successful. He was
given a very high degree of autonomy. He even had the habit, known to and permitted by his
employers, of writing on Skynet notepaper and describing himself as a â€˜directorâ€™. This Skynet
notepaper, in breach of s 351 of the Companies Act 1985, omitted to contain the registered name,
company number, and address of Akhter, leaving the reader no indication as to whom David
Bennett might answer. Mr B ennett made a contract on behalf of Skynet to arrange for the supply
of power-supply units to Pitney-Bowes and share the commission with SMC, which had passed
the procurement contract on to Akhter through Mr Bennett. Later Akhter contended that it was not
required to pay SMC a share of the commission because Mr Bennett had no authority to make the
commission-splitting deal.
Held - by the Court of Appeal - that since the agreement was reasonably associated with his job,
Mr Bennett had actual authority to enter into the deal. In any event, he had ostensible authority to
enter into commission agreements generally because that was ordinarily incidental to his duties.
Furthermore, SMC was not on notice of any lack of authority.
There was no argument in the case that this contract was beyond the powers of the company or
the board, so that it was presumably not necessary to use s 35A of the Companies Act 1985
to validate Mr Bennettâ€™s actions. The court was merely applying the common rules of agency.
The provisions of Mr Bennettâ€™s employment contract were also of crucial importance. The relevant
provision was in the following terms: â€˜Job title: Director PSU sales. You must perform such
duties as may be reasonably associated with your job title.â€™ Perhaps Akhter should have been
more restrictive.

Directors and others as agents
Kreditbank Casselv Schenkers Ltd[1927] 1 KB 826
Under the articles of the company the directors were empowered to decide who should draw bills
of exchange on behalf of the company. A Mr Clarke, who was the Manchester branch manager of
Schenkers, drew bills of exchange on the companyâ€™s behalf in favour of Kreditbank. He had no
authority to do so. The court later held that the bills were not binding on the company because it
was, on the evidence, unusual for a branch manager to have such authority.
Where the company document which the outsider relies
upon is a forgery
The rules of law laid down in Turquandand the other general rules of agency described above
together with the statutory contribution of s 40 will not validate a forgery. A forgery is a crime
and in no sense a genuine transaction.
Rubenv Great Fingall Consolidated[1906] AC 439
Rowe was the secretary of the company and he asked the appellants, who were stockbrokers, to
get him a loan of Â£20,000. The appellants procured the money and advanced it in good faith on
the security of the share certificate of the company issued by Rowe, the latter stating that the
appellants were registered in the register of members, which was not the case. The certificate was
in accordance with the companyâ€™s articles, bore the companyâ€™s seal, and was signed by two directors and the secretary, Rowe; but Rowe had forged the signatures of the two directors. When
the fraud was discovered, the appellants tried to get registration, and when this failed, they sued
the company in estoppel.
Held - by the House of Lords - a company secretary had no authority to do more than deliver the
share certificates, and in the absence of evidence that the company had held Rowe out as having
authority to actually issue certificates, the company was not estopped by a forged certificate.
Neither was the company responsible for the fraud of its secretary, because it was not within
the scope of his employm ent to issue certificates. This was a matter for the directors. The Lord
Chancellor, Lord Loreburn, said:
The forged certificate is a pure nullity. It is quite true that persons dealing with limited liability companies are not bound to inquire into their indoor management, and will not be affected by irregularities of which they had no notice. But this doctrine, which is well established, applies only to
irregularities that might otherwise affect a genuine transaction. It cannot apply to a forgery.
Defective authority and insiders
The rule in Turquandâ€™s case, and the ostensible or usual authority rules of agency which have
been considered above, are in general designed to protect persons who deal with the company
from outside against defects in the internal management of the companyâ€™s affairs. Members
of a company can take advantage of the rule and in Bargate v Shortridge(1855) 5 HL Cas 297
it was held that a member could rely upon a written consent purporting to be given by the
board, as required by the articles, allowing him to transfer his shares, even though it was given
by the managing director alone. The company could not set aside the transfer and restore the
memberâ€™s name to the register.

Chapter 6 The company and its contracts
Directors and persons who act as such in regard to the transaction in question are regarded
as insiders and cannot rely on the rule. Thus, an allotment of shares made to a director at
a meeting at which he was present by a board, some or all of whom were not properly
appointed, would be invalid. As Lord Simonds said in Morris vKanssen[1946] 1 All ER 586
(the case in point) in regard to directors: â€˜To admit in their favour a presumption that that is
rightly done which they themselves have wrongly done is to encourage ignorance and careless
dereliction from duty.â€™
However, if a director does not act as such in connection with a transaction, he may be able
to rely on the rule. Thus in Hely-Hutchinson vBrayhead[1968] l QB 549 it was held that a
director who lent money to his companyâ€™s subsidiary, and also guaranteed loans to it by other
persons, could enforce an agreement to indemnify him given in the companyâ€™s name by a
fellow director who had assumed the functions of managing director on an irregular basis but
with the acquiescence of the board. The company was represented in the transaction only by
the fellow director, and the director who made the loan was not therefore prevented from
relying on the rule. Lord Denning MR observed:
The judge held that Mr Richards had ostensible or apparent authority to make the contract,
but I think that his findings carry with them the necessary inference that he had also actual
authority, such authority being implied from the circumstance that the board, by their conduct
over many months, had acquiesced in his acting as their chief executive and committing
Brayhead to contracts without the necessity of sanction from the board.

3 B is the managing director of T Ltd. He has decided that the company should have a new
factory built. He arranges for P Ltd to carry out the building work on the usual standard term
contract for the building industry which requires that T Ltd makes progress payments on a
three-monthly basis.
The articles of association of T Ltd provide that the directors of the company may negotiate
any contract on the companyâ€™s behalf up to a value of Â£100,000 but contracts in excess of this
sum must be approved by the company passing an ordinary resolution in general meeting.
The value of this building contract is Â£500,000. B did not obtain the approval of the general
meeting. The first progress payment has now fallen due and the other directors of T Ltd have
resolved not to pay it on the grounds that the contract was not properly authorised by the
shareholders.
You are required to explain whether T Ltd is bound to pay this progress payment and more
generally whether T Ltd is bound to the contract with P Ltd.

(b) Beetlecrush Ltd was a company involved in pest control. In 1999 Pellet was appointed as
managing director of the company by a board resolution, which gave him exclusive power
to manage the company, subject only to a requirement to get the approval of the board for
all contracts in excess of Â£50,000.
On behalf of the company, Pellet began negotiating for the purchase of insecticides from
Toxin, who had supplied the company with similar products for a number of years. Before
these negotiations were concluded, Toxin accepted an invitation to become a member of
the board of Beetlecrush Ltd, and thenceforth duly attended its board meetings. Some
months after this, Pellet, without getting the approval of the board, signed a contract with
Toxin for the supply of Â£80,000 worth of insecticides.
Preliminary trials with these insecticides have revealed that they are not as effective as
the company had been hoping. The board, with the exception of Pellet and Toxin, is now
seeking some way in which the company can claim that it is not bound by its obligations
under the contract.

The capital of a company

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
Acompany may confer different rights on different classes of shares, the main types being
preference and ordinary shares. Shares may also be non-voting or have multiple voting
rights. In the most extreme situations, shares may also carry additional voting rights on particular resolutions (i.e. to remove a director) as in the case ofBushellv Faith[1970] AC 1099.
There is no implied condition in a companyâ€™s articles that all of its shares shall be equal
(Andrewsv Gas Meter Co [1897] 1 Ch 361).
Andrewsv Gas Meter Co[1897] 1 Ch 361
Per Lindley LJ:
The question raised by this appeal is whether certain preference shares issued by a limited company
as long ago as 1865 were validly issued or not...The companyâ€™s original capital as stated in its
memorandum of association was â€˜60,000l, divided into 600 shares of 100 leach, every share being
sub-divisible into fifths, with power to increase the capital as provided by the articles of associationâ€™.
By the articles of association which accompanied the memorandum of association, and were registered with it, power was given to the company to increase the capital (Art 27), and it was provided
that any new capital should be considered as part of the original capital (Art 28). The issue of preference shares was not contemplated or authorised. In 1865 the company desired to acquire additional
works, and passed a special resolution under the powers conferred by the Companies Act 1862,
ss 50 and 51, altering the articles and authorising the issue of 100 shares of 100 leach, fully paid, and
bearing a preferential dividend of 5 lper cent per annum. Those shares were accordingly issued to
the vendors of the works referred to, and are the shares the validity of which is now in question. The
company has been prosperous, and the ordinary shareholders have for years received a higher dividend than the preference shareholders. A considerable reserve has also been accumulated, and this
action has been brought to determine the rights of the preference shareholders to this reserve fund.
The learned judge has held that the creation of the preference shares was ultra vires, and that their
holders never became and are not now shareholders in the company, and that they have none of the
rights of shareholders, whether preference or ordinary. He has not, however, declared more definitely
what their rights are. They have appealed from this decision; but on the appeal they only claimed to
be preference shareholders entitled to a preferential dividend of 5 per cent. Their claim to any share
of the reserve fund was dropped. The judgment against the validity of the preference shares is based
upon the well-known cas e of Hutton v Scarborough Cliff Hotel Co which came twice before
Kindersley V-C. in 1865, and which Kekewich J very naturally held to be binding on him. Kindersley
V-Câ€™s first decision was that a limited company which had not issued the whole of its original capital
could not issue the unallotted shares as preference shares unless authorised so to do by its memorandum of association or by its articles of association. This decision was affirmed on appeal and was
obviously correct; and would have been correct even if the whole of the original capital had been
issued and the preference shares had been new and additional capital. The company, however, afterwards passed a special resolution altering the articles and authorising an issue of preference shares.
This raised an entirely different question, and led to the second decision. The Vice-Chancellor granted
an injunction restraining the issue of the preference shares, and he held distinctly that the resolution
altering the articles was ultra vires. He did so upon the ground, as we understand his judgment, that
there was in the memorandum of association a condition that all the shareholders should stand on an
equal footing as to the receipt of dividends, and that this condition was one which could not be got
rid of by a special resolution altering the articles of association under the powers conferred by ss 50
and 51 of the Act...
These decisions turned upon the principle that although by s 8 of the Act the memorandum is
to state the amount of the original capital and the number of shares into which it is to be divided,
yet in other respects the rights of the shareholders in respect of their shares and the terms on which
additional capital may be raised are matters to be regulated by the articles of association rather than
by the memorandum, and are, therefore, matters which (unless provided for by the memorandum, as

The capital of a company
in Ashbury v Watson may be determined by the company from time to time by special resolution
pursuant to s 50 of the Act. This view, however, clearly negatives the doctrine that there is a condition in the memorandum of association that all shareholders are to be on an equality unless the
memorandum itself shows the contrary. That proposition is, in our opinion, unsound.
âž¨ See p. 56 As noted earlier in Chapter 2 âž¨ under s 9(4), the required contents of the application for
registration include a statement of capital and initial shareholdings if the company is to have
a share capital. The details of this statement are outlined in s 10 of the Companies Act 2006,
providing (under s 10(2)(c)) that for each class of shares it must state:
(a) prescribed particulars of the rights attached to the shares;
(b) the total number of shares of that class; and
(c) the aggregate nominal value of shares of that class.
The importance of this process is reinforced by the wording of s 629(1), which states that
â€˜for the purposes of the Companies Acts, shares are of one class if the rights attached to them
are in all respects uniformâ€™. Section 629(2) goes on to note that â€˜for this purpose the rights
attached to shares are not regarded as different from those attached to other shares by reason
only that they do not carry the same rights to dividends in the twelve months immediately
following their allotmentâ€™.
However, beyond these references of â€˜class rightsâ€™ the Companies Act 2006 does not provide any further clarification as to the meaning of the term. In this respect, one needs to refer
to the case law in the area, in particular that of Cumbrian Newspapers(below).
Cumbrian Newspapers Group Ltdv Cumberland & Westmorland Herald
[1986] 3 WLR 26
A company which issued shares to a shareholder and amended its articles to grant the shareholder
particular rights to prevent a take-over could not later cancel the articles since the shareholder had
rights attached to a class of shares which could not be abrogated. The plaintiff and defendant were
both publishers of newspapers. They negotiated a transaction whereby D would acquire one of Pâ€™s
papers and P would acquire 10 per cent of Dâ€™s share capital. D duly issued the 10 per cent shareholding and as part of the agreement under which the shares were issued amended its articles
to grant P rights of pre-emption over other ordinary shares, rights in respect of unissued shares,
and the right to appoint a director. The purpose of such rights was to enable P as a shareholder
to prevent a takeover of D. After several years, the directors of D proposed to convene an extraordinary general meeting and to pass a special resolution to cancel the articles which gave special
rights to P. P sought a declaration that the rights were class rights which could not be abrogated
without his consent, and an injunction restraining D from holding the meeting.
Held- granting the declaration - that the special rights granted by the articles were rights which
although not attached to any particular shares were conferred on P as a shareholder in D and were
attached to the shares held for the time being by P without which it was not entitled to the rights.
Accordingly, P had â€˜rights attached to a class of sharesâ€™ and since the Companies Act 1985 s 125
(now s 630 under the Companies Act 2006) provided that class rights could not be varied or abrogated without the consent of the class members, the special rights enjoyed by P could not be
varied or abrogated without his consent.
In this case Scott J made the following observations with respect to class rights:
Rights or benefits which may be contained in articles can be divided into three different categories.
First, there are rights or benefits which are annexed to particular shares. Classic examples of rights

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
of this character are dividend rights and rights to participate in surplus assets on a winding up. If
articles provide that particular shares carry particular rights not enjoyed by the holders of other shares,
it is easy to conclude that the rights are attached to a class of shares [...] A second category of rights
or benefits which may be contained in articles would cover rights or benefits conferred on individuals
not in the capacity of members or shareholders of the company but, for ulterior reasons, connected
with the administration of the companyâ€™s affairs or the conduct of its business. Eley v Positive
Government Security Life Assurance Co Ltd(1875) 1 Ex D 20 was a case where the articles of the
defendant company had included a provision that the plaintiff should be the company solicitor [...]
It is, perhaps, obvious that rights or benefits in this category cannot be class rights. They cannot be
described as rights attached to a class of shares [...] That leaves the third category. This category
would cover rights or benefits that, although not attached to any particular shares, were nonetheless
conferred on the beneficiary in the capacity of member or shareholder of the company. The rights
of the plaintiff fall, in my judgment, into this category [...] In the present case, the rights conferred
on the plaintiff were, as I have held, conferred on the plaintiff as a member or shareholder of the
defendant. The rights would not be enforceable by the plaintiff otherwise than as the owner of ordinary shares in the defendant. If the plaintiff were to divest itself of all its ordinary shares in the defendant, it would not then, in my view, be in a position to enforce the rights in the articles. But the
rights were not attached to any particular share or shares. Enforcement by the plaintiff of the rights
granted under the articles would require no more than ownership by the plaintiff of at least some
shares in the defendant. Enforcement by the plaintiff of the rights granted under article 12, require the
plaintiff to hold at least 10 per cent of the issued shares in the defendant. But any shares would do.
It follows, in my judgment that the plaintiffâ€™s rights under the articles in question fall squarely within
this third category.
(i) The case is unusual because one generally thinks of rights attaching to a whole class of shares
and not to the holder of part only of a class.
(ii) A similar and earlier decision is that in Re United Provident Assurance Co Ltd[1910] 2 Ch 477
where it was held that shareholders within a class who have paid up different amounts on their
shares must be regarded as a separate class and on a variation must meet separately as a class.
The general principle is that the rights enjoyed by one particular class should not be varied
by the holders of another class of shares within the company (i.e. it is necessary to gain the
consent of the members of the class whose rights are the subject of proposed variation to agree
to this process). This process is covered by s 630 of the Companies Act 2006 and necessarily
raises the question as to what amounts to a â€˜variation of rightsâ€™ for the purposes of this provision (see White vBristol Aeroplanebelow). It should be noted that this process is over and
above that outlined in s 21 (amendment of the companyâ€™s articles of association) and provides an important protective function. For example, if the class in question involves preference shares which are non-voting, then without s 630 they may never have an input into
the proposed changes to the rights attached to their shares (i.e. the process would be open
to exploitation by the majority in general meeting; a majority comprised holders of ordinary shares). As such, the class in question must vote in favour of the proposed amendment
in a separate class meeting, followed by the s 21 process in the context of the general
meeting. (It is perhaps worth considering the case of Allenv Gold Reefsin this context - see
âž¨ See p. 115 Chapter 5 âž¨.)
In addition to this, it may be observed that s 22 provides for the entrenchment of provisions of the articles. In other words, that specified provisions may only be amended or
repealed if conditions are met, or procedures are complied with that are more restrictive than
a special resolution.

Preference shares
Ordinary shares
The nature of an ordinary share is perhaps best understood by comparing it with a preference
share. In this way we can ascertain the distinguishing features, and the advantages and disadvantages which arise from the holding of ordinary shares.
Disadvantages
The main perceived disadvantage is the fact that the ordinary shareholder is entitled to a dividend only after the preference dividends have been paid. Furthermore, where the preference
shares have preference as to capital, the ordinary shares rank behind the preference shares for
repayment of capital on winding-up or where there is a reduction of capital by repayment.
âž¨ See p. 162 The preference shares must be fully repaid first (see further Chapter 8 âž¨).
It is perhaps because of the above priorities given to preference shareholders that the ordinary shareholders are said to hold the equity share capital of the company, presumably by analogy with the equity of redemption held by a mortgagor in the law of mortgages. A mortgagor
who pays off all the charges on his property has the right to redeem or recover it by virtue of
this equity; indeed it is the last right he retains, for when that is gone, he has lost his property.
Similarly, the equity shareholders are entitled to the remaining assets of the company after the
claims of creditors and of preference shareholders have been met.
Advantages
Here we may observe that the voting power of the ordinary shareholders in general meetings
is such as to allow them to control the resolutions at such meetings. In fact, this means that
the directorate really represents, or can be made to represent, the ordinary shareholders.
It is not uncommon for companies to issue preference shares with no voting rights at general meetings, though if such shares are to be listed on the Stock Exchange, they must be given
adequate voting rights by the companyâ€™s articles. It would seem, however, that the voting
rights of preference shareholders are adequate if they can vote:
(a) when their dividend is in arrear;
(b) on resolutions for reducing share capital and winding up the company; and
(c) on resolutions which are likely to affect their class rights (s 630).
A further advantage of ordinary shareholders is that their dividends are not fixed and may
rise considerably with the profitability of the company.
A final advantage is that a company may issue bonus shares for which the shareholder does not
pay in cash, or make new issues (called rights issues) at prices lower than outsiders would have
to pay, and both of these are generally offered to the companyâ€™s existing ordinary shareholders.
Preference shares
These shares are entitled to preferential treatment when dividends are declared. Thus, a 10 per
cent preference share must receive a dividend of 10 per cent out of profits before anything can

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
be paid to the ordinary shares. Since there may be several classes of preference shares ranking
one after the other, it is essential to ascertain the precise rights of a holder of a particular preference share.
However, a right to preferential dividend without more is deemed a right to a cumulative
dividend (i.e. if no dividend is declared on the preference shares in any year, the arrears are
carried forward and must be paid before any dividend can be declared on ordinary shares
(Webb vEarle(1875) LR 20 Eq 556)). Thus, if the 10 per cent preference shares mentioned
above received dividends of 5 per cent in 1999; 5 per cent in 2000; and nothing in 2001; they
would be entitled at the end of 2002 to 5 + 5 + 10 + 10, or 30 per cent before the ordinary
shareholders could have a penny.
However, it may be expressly provided by the terms of issue that they are to be noncumulative but it is rare nowadays to find such a provision in the case of shares issued by public companies; and they may be held to be non-cumulative by implication, as where the terms
of issue or the articles provide that dividends shall be paid â€˜out of yearly profitsâ€™ (Adair vOld
Bushmills Distillery[1908] WN 24) or â€˜out of the net profits of each yearâ€™ (Staples vEastman
Photographic Materials Co[1896] 2 Ch 303).
Preference shares do not carry the right to participate in any surplus profits of the company unless the articles so provide (Will v United Lankat Plantations Co [1914] AC 11).
However, it is possible to create cumulative and participating preference shares, conferring
on the holders of such shares a right to participate in surplus profits up to a given percentage,
e.g. a right to a preferential dividend of 6 per cent plus a further right, after, say, 10 per cent
has been paid to ordinary shareholders, to participate in surplus profits until a further 6 per
cent has been paid but no more.
Arrears of preference dividend in a winding-up
In the absence of an express provision in the articles, no arrears of preference dividend
are payable in the winding-up of a company unless the dividend has already been declared
(Re Crichtonâ€™s Oil Co[1902] 2 Ch 86) and this is so even where the articles provide for the
payment of dividends due at the date of winding-up, for a dividend is not due until declared
(Re Roberts and Cooper Ltd[1929] 2 Ch 383). Where the articles do provide for payment of
arrears, they may be paid out of the surplus assets after payment of the companyâ€™s debts, even
though those assets do not contain any undistributed profits (Re Wharfedale Brewery Co
[1952] Ch 913). Thus, the general rule that dividends must not be paid out of capital does not
apply in this sort of situation. However, unless there is a specific provision which says so, the
right to arrears ceases at the date of liquidation (Re E W Savory Ltd [1951] All ER 1036).
Even where the articles or terms of issue do contain a provision regarding the repayment
of dividend and/or capital to preference shareholders in a winding-up, problems of construction arise, i.e. problems arise with regard to the meaning of the words used. For example, in
Re Walter Symons Ltd[1934] Ch 308, preference shares were issued with â€˜the right to a fixed
cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 12 per cent per annum on the capital for the
time being paid up thereon [...] and to rank both as regards dividends and capital in priority to the ordinary shares but with no right to any further participation in profits or assetsâ€™. The
court took the view that the italicised words envisaged a winding-up, because it is only in
winding up that the question of participation in assets arises. Therefore, the rest of the clause
must also apply in a winding-up, and the preference shares had priority in a winding-up for
repayment of dividends unpaid at that date.

Preference shares
However, in Re Wood, Skinner and Co Ltd[1944] Ch 323, the preference shareholders had
â€˜the right to a fixed cumulative dividend of 6 per cent per annum on the capital paid up on
the sharesâ€™, and were expressed to rank â€˜both as regards dividends and capital in priority to
the ordinary sharesâ€™. In this case the court decided that since the latter part of the clause did
not refer solely to the winding-up situation, the priority conferred was restricted to dividends
declared while the company was in operation, and did not give the right to arrears of dividend
once a winding-up had commenced.
Of course, a person drafting terms of issue today would normally make his intentions more
clear than was done in the two cases cited above, and would certainly not use the phrases
which were used then. Nevertheless, problems do arise out of bad draftsmanship and the cases
show how the court might deal with such situations.
A typical modern clause in the terms of issue of preference shares which more clearly
expresses the rights intended to be conferred is as follows.
The holders of preference shares shall be entitled to a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at
the rate of X per cent per annum upon the amount paid up thereon, and in the event of the
winding up of the company, to repayment of the amount paid up thereon together with any
arrears of dividend calculated to the date of such repayment in priority to the claims of ordinary shares, but shall have no other right to participate in the assets or profits of the company.
It should be noted that under such a clause unpaid preference dividends will be payable for
periods up to the repayment of the preference capital, even though the dividends have not
been declared and in spite of the fact that the company may not have earned sufficient profits
to pay them while it was a going concern (Re Wharfedale Brewery Co[1952] Ch 913).
Repayment of capital on winding-up
Preference shares have no inherent priority as to the repayment of capital in a winding-up.
If the assets are not enough to pay the preference and ordinary shares in full then, unless the
articles or terms of issue provide to the contrary, preference and ordinary shares are paid off
rateably according to the nominal value of their shares (Birch vCropper(1889) 14 App Cas
525). Where, as is usual, the preference shares have priority either by the articles or terms of
issue, they are entitled to repayment of their capital in full before the ordinary shareholders
receive anything by way of repayment of capital. Where there are surplus assets left after the
discharge of all the companyâ€™s liabilities and the repayment of capital to all shareholders, the
surplus is divided among ordinary and preference shareholders unless the articles provide to
the contrary. Any rights given by the articles are exhaustive. Thus, where the articles give preference shareholders priority of repayment of capital in a winding-up, but do not refer to any
further rights in the capital of the company, the preference shareholders have no right to
participate in surplus capital (Scottish Insurance vWilsons).
Scottish Insurance Corporation Ltdv Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd
[1949] AC 462
The articles of a company provided inter alia that, in the event of the company being wound up,
the preference shares â€˜shall rank before the other shares of the company on the property of
the company to the extent of repayment of the amounts called upon and paid thereonâ€™. The company, whose colliery assets had been transferred to and vested in the National Coal Board, had

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
postponed liquidation till the compensation provided under the Coal Industry Nationalisation
Act 1946 had been settled and paid, but as a preliminary step towards liquidation had passed a
special resolution for the reduction of capital by which the whole paid-up capital was to be
returned to the holders of preference stock.
Held- the holders of preference stock had no right to share in the surplus assets and that consequently it could not be said that the proposed reduction was not fair and equitable between the
different classes of shareholders, and that it should therefore be confirmed.
PerLord Simonds:
Reading these articles as a whole [...] I would not hesitate to say, first, that the last thing a preference stockholder would expect to get (I do not speak here of the legal rights) would be a share of
surplus assets, and that such a share would be a windfall beyond his reasonable expectations and,
secondly, that he had at all times the knowledge, enforced in this case by the unusual reference in
Art 139 to the payment off of the preference capital, that at least he ran the risk, if the companyâ€™s
circumstances admitted, of such a reduction as is now proposed being submitted for confirmation by
the court. Whether a man lends money to a company at 7 per cent or subscribes for its shares carrying a cumulative preferential dividend at that rate, I do not think that he can complain of unfairness
if the company, being in a position lawfully to do so, proposes to pay him off. No doubt, if the company is content not to do so, he may get something that he can never have expected but, so long as
the company can lawfully repay him, whether it be months or years before a contemplated liquidation, I see no ground for the court refusing its confirmation...
It is clear from the authorities, and would be clear without them, that, subject to any relevant provision of the general law, the rights inter seof preference and ordinary shareholders must depend on
the terms of the instrument which contains the bargain that they have made with the company and
each other. This means, that there is a question of construction to be determined and undesirable
though it may be that fine distinctions should be drawn in commercial documents such as articles of
association of a company, your Lordships cannot decide that the articles here under review have a
particular meaning, because to somewhat similar articles in such cases as In Re William Metcalfe &
Sons Ltdthat meaning has been judicially attributed. Reading the relevant articles, as a whole, I come
to the conclusion that Arts 159 and 160 are exhaustive of the rights of the preference stockholders in
a winding up. The whole tenor of the articles, as I have already pointed out, is to leave the ordinary
stockholders masters of the situation. If there are â€˜surplus assetsâ€™ it is because the ordinary stockholders have contrived that it should be so, and, though this is not decisive, in determining what the
parties meant by their bar gain, it is of some weight that it should be in the power of one class so to
act that there will or will not be surplus assets...
But, apart from those more general considerations, the words of the specifically relevant articles,
â€˜rank before the other shares...on the property of the company to the extent of repayment of the
amounts called up and paid thereonâ€™, appear to me apt to define exhaustively the rights of the preference stockholders in a winding up. Similar words, in Willv United Lankat Plantations Co Ltdâ€˜rank,
both as regards capital and dividend, in priority to the other sharesâ€™, were held to define exhaustively
the rights of preference shareholders to dividend, and I do not find in the speeches of Viscount
Haldane LC or Earl Loreburn in that case any suggestion that a different result would have followed
if the dispute had been in regard to capital. I do not ignore that in the same case in the Court of Appeal
the distinction between dividend and capital was expressly made by both Cozens-Hardy MR and
Farwell LJ, and that in In re William Metcalfe & Sons Ltd51 Romer LJ reasserted it. But I share the
difficulty, which Lord Keith has expressed in this case, in reconciling the reasoning that lies behind
the judgments in Willâ€™s case 53 and In re William Metcalfe & Sons Ltdrespectively.
The following is, therefore, a summary of the position:
(a) Where the preference shareholders have no priority in regard to repayment of capital,
they share the assets rateably with the ordinary shareholders, including any surplus assets
left after repayment of share capital and other liabilities.

Variation and abrogation of class rights
(b) If the articles or terms of issue give the preference shareholders priority for repayment
of capital, they are repaid the nominal value of their shares before the ordinary shareholders but no more.
In addition, it should be noted that if the articles give preference shareholders an express
right to participate equally with the ordinary shareholders in surplus assets, they are entitled
to share in such assets even though they include ploughed back profits of former years which
could have been distributed as dividend to ordinary shareholders but which instead were
placed in reserve (Dimbula Valley (Ceylon) Tea Co Ltd vLaurie[1961] 1 All ER 769). The fact
that the ordinary shareholders are, while the company is a going concern, in charge of
the profit, i.e. they can resolve upon a distribution within the provisions of Part VIII of the
Companies Act 1985, does not prevent the preference shareholders having a right to participate in those profits which the ordinary shareholders have left undistributed.
Variation and abrogation of class rights
If the shares of a company are divided into different classes (e.g. ordinary and preference), the
expression â€˜class rightsâ€™ refers to the special rights of a particular class of shareholder concerning, e.g. dividends and voting and rights on a winding-up. The Companies Act 2006
makes it clear that abrogation of class rights is included. This means that class rights can be
extinguished entirely as well as merely varied provided the appropriate procedures of s 630
as set out below are followed. However, the process outlined in s 630 must be complied
with, over and above that outlined in s 21 which deals with the amendment of the companyâ€™s
articles by way of a special resolution. Consequently, there is a built-in protective mechanism
for those within the company who enjoy class rights.
1 Meaning of variation
Case law decided that class rights are to be regarded as varied only if after the purported
act of variation they are different in substance from before as where the company proposes
to make its existing cumulative preference shares non-cumulative. Unless this is so, consent
of the particular class or classes of shareholders is not required. The courts have in general
taken a narrow and, perhaps, over-literal approach to the meaning of variation of rights. For
instance, in Adelaide Electric Co vPrudential Assurance [1934] AC 122, HL, the court held
that the alteration of the place of payment of a preferential dividend did not vary the rights of
the preference shareholders (despite the fact that the exchange rate acted in favour of the
company and against the preference shareholders).
Another example has already been given in Greenhalgh vArderne Cinemas, 1946. In particular, the creation of new rights in others does not amount to a variation if existing rights
are preserved. Thus, Boxo Ltd has â€˜Aâ€™ ordinary shares with one vote each and â€˜Bâ€™ ordinaries
with one vote each. If the company increases the voting power of the â€˜Aâ€™ ordinaries to two
votes per share, is that a variation of the rights of the â€˜Bâ€™ ordinary shares? From the decision
in Greenhalgh, it would seem not.
Other cases which are worth reading so as to gain an interesting insight into the approach
adopted by the courts in this area are as follows: Re Saltdean Estate Co Ltd[1968] 1 WLR 1844

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
âž¨ See p. 169 (see Chapter 8 âž¨); Prudential Assurance Co vChatterly Whitfield Colleries[1949] AC 512; Re
John Smithâ€™s Tadcaster Brewery Co[1953] Ch 308, CA. The following cases are also of interest.
House of Fraser plcv ACGE Investments[1987] 2 WLR 1083
In this case the House of Lords decided that where a company pays off and cancels cumulative
preference shares (which have priority for repayment of capital in the companyâ€™s articles) in a capital reduction there is no need for a class meeting of the preference shareholders to approve this.
In the circumstances their rights have not been varied but merely put into effect. One of the rights
attached to the preference shares was the right to a return of capital in priority to other shareholders when any capital was returned as being in excess of the companyâ€™s needs. That right was
not being affected, modified, dealt with or abrogated. It was merely being put into effect. The company was granting the preference shareholders their rights, not denying them.
Whitev Bristol Aeroplane[1953] Ch 65
The defendant company had sent out notices of proposed resolutions to increase the ordinary and
preference stock of the company from GBP 3,900,000 to GBP 5,880,000, of which GBP 660,000
preference stock was to be distributed to the ordinary shareholders by new issues. There was a
certain equilibrium between the ordinary stock and the preference stock, and it was objected that
that equilibrium would be upset when the new shares were issued to the detriment of the preference stockholders and that their rights were â€˜affectedâ€™ within the meaning of Art 68 of the companyâ€™s articles and that the company could not carry out the proposed plan without first obtaining
a vote of the preference stockholders. Art 68 provided:
All or any of the rights or privileges attached to any class of shares forming part of the capital for the
time being of the company may be affected modified varied dealt with or abrogated in any manner
with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the members of that
class. To any such separate meeting all the provisions of these articles as to general meetings shall
mutatis mutandisapply [...]
Held- on appeal - the provisions of the articles were inconsistent with the view that any variation
which in any manner touched or affected the value of the preference stock or the character or
enjoyment of any of the holdersâ€™ privileges was within the contemplation of Art 68; the question
was whether the rights of the preference stockholders were â€˜affectedâ€™, not as a matter of business,
but according to the meaning of the articles when construed according to the rules of construction and as a matter of law; those rights would not be affected by the proposed resolution, and,
consequently, the appeal must be allowed.
In this regard, Evershed MR noted:
The question then is - and, indeed, I have already posed it - are the rights which I have already summarised â€˜affectedâ€™ by what is proposed? It is said in answer - and I think rightly said - No, they are
not; they remain exactly as they were before; each one of the manifestations of the preference stockholdersâ€™ privileges may be repeated without any change whatever after, as before, the proposed distribution. It is no doubt true that the enjoyment of, and the capacity to make effective, those rights is
in a measure affected; for as I have already indicated, the existing preference stockholders will be in
a less advantageous position on such occasions as entitle them to register their votes, whether at
general meetings of the company or at separate meetings of their own class. But there is to my mind
a distinction, and a sensible distinction, between an affecting of the rights and an affecting of the
enjoyment of the rights, or of the stockholdersâ€™ capacity to turn them to account.

Variation and abrogation of class rights
2 Method of variation or abrogation
The method by which the variation or abrogation was effected under the Companies Act 1985
depended upon the source of the class rights. In other words, the process under s 125 of the
1985 Act was dependent upon whether the rights were conferred by the companyâ€™s memorandum, articles of association, or even by way of the resolution setting out the terms of issue.
This inevitably led to a rather complex process.
By contrast, s 630 of the Companies Act 2006 sets down a single, straightforward rule.
(This has been made possible in part by the reforms surrounding the reduced role which the
memorandum now plays in the day-to-day running of a company under s 8.) Consequently,
s 630(2) states that variation of the rights attached to a class of shares may only be varied:
(a) in accordance with provisions in the companyâ€™s articles for the variation of class rights;
(b) where the companyâ€™s articles contain no such provision, if the holders of shares of that
class consent to the variation in accordance with this section.
Section 630(4) goes on to provide that the consent required under s 630(2)(b) is either (a)
consent in writing from the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of the issued
shares of that class; or (b) a special resolution, passed at a separate general meeting of the
holders of that class, sanctioning the variation.
Consequently, a resolution to vary the rights of a particular class is of no legal effect unless
the consent of the class is obtained. However, it should be borne in mind that any vote on a
resolution to modify class rights must be undertaken for the purpose (or predominant purpose) of benefiting the class as a whole (British America Nickel Corporation Ltd v Oâ€™Brien
[1927] AC 369).
British America Nickel Corporation Ltdv Oâ€™Brien[1927] AC 369
A company, incorporated in Canada, issued mortgage bonds secured by a trust deed, which gave
power to a majority of the bondholders, consisting of not less than three-fourths in value, to sanction any modification of the rights of the bondholders. A scheme for the reconstruction of the company provided for the mortgage bonds being exchanged for income bonds subject to an issue of
first income bonds; also that a committee, one only of whom was to be appointed by the mortgage
bondholders, should have power to modify the scheme without confirmation by the bondholders.
The scheme was sanctioned by the majority of the bondholders requisite under the trust deed. The
required majority would not have been obtained but for the vote of the holder of a large number of
bonds, whose support of the scheme was obtained by the promise of a large block of ordinary
stock, an arrangement which was not mentioned in the scheme. Viscount Haldane stated:
To give a power to modify the terms on which debentures in a company are secured is not uncommon in practice. The business interests of the company may render such a power expedient, even in
the interests of the class of debenture holders as a whole. The provision is usually made in the form
of a power, conferred by the instrument constituting the debenture security, upon the majority of the
class of holders. It often enables them to modify, by resolution properly passed, the security itself.
The provision of such a power to a majority bears some analogy to such a power as that conferred
by s 13 of the English Companies Act of 1908, which enables a majority of the shareholders by
special resolution to alter the articles of association. There is, however, a restriction of such powers,
when conferred on a majority of a special class in order to enable that majority to bind a minority.
They must be exercised subject to a general principle, which is applicable to all authorities conferred

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
on majorities of classes enabling them to bind minorities; namely, that the power given must be exercised for the purpose of benefiting the class as a whole, and not merely individual members only.
Subject to this, the power may be unrestricted. It may be free from the general principle in question
when the power arises not in connection with a class, but only under a general title which confers the
vote as a right of property attaching to a share. The distinction does not arise in this case, and it is
not necessary to express an opinion as to its ground. What does arise is the question whether there
is such a restriction on the right to vote of a creditor or member of an analogous class on whom is
conferred a power to vote for the alteration of the title of a minority of the class to which he himself
belongs...
[T]heir Lordships do not think that there is any real difficulty in combining the principle that while
usually a holder of shares or debentures may vote as his interest directs, he is subject to the further
principle that where his vote is conferred on him as a member of a class he must conform to the interest of the class itself when seeking to exercise the power conferred on him in his capacity of being a
member. The second principle is a negative one, one which puts a restriction on the completeness of
freedom under the first, without excluding such freedom wholly.
The distinction, which may prove a fine one, is well illustrated in the carefully worded judgment of
Parker J in Goodfellowv Nelson Line. It was there held that while the power conferred by a trust deed
on a majority of debenture holders to bind a minority must be exercised bona fide, and while the Court
has power to prevent some sorts at least of unfairness or oppression, a debenture holder may, subject to this vote in accordance with his individual interests, though these may be peculiar to himself
and not shared by the other members of the class. It was true that a secret bargain to secure his vote
by special treatment might be treated as bribery, but where the scheme to be voted upon itself
provides, as it did in that case, openly for special treatment of a debenture holder with a special
interest, he may vote, inasmuch as the other members of the class had themselves known from the
first of the scheme. Their Lordships think that Parker J accurately applied in his judgment the law on
this point...
Their Lordships are of opinion that judgment was rightly given for the respondents in this appeal.
It is plain, even from his own letters, that before Mr JR Booth would agree to the scheme of 1921 his
vote had to be secured by the promise of $2,000,000 ordinary stock of the Nickel Corporation.
No doubt he was entitled in giving his vote to consider his own interests. But as that vote had come
to him as a member of a class he was bound to exercise it with the interests of the class itself
kept in view as dominant. It may be that, as Ferguson JA thought, he and those with whom he was
negotiating considered the scheme the best way out of the difficulties with which the corporation
was beset. But they had something else to consider in the first place. Their duty was to look to
the difficulties of the bondholders as a class, and not to give any one of these bondholders a
special personal advantage, not forming part of the scheme to be voted for, in order to induce him
Held- that the resolution was invalid, both because the bondholder in voting had not treated the
interest of the whole class of bondholders as the dominant consideration, and because the
scheme, so far as it provided for a committee, was ultra vires.
It is also worth noting at this point that according to s 630(5), any attempt to amend a provision contained in the articles for the variation of the rights attached to a class of shares is to
be treated as a variation of those rights.
3 Right to object to variation
Dissentient members of a class may object to variation. The holders of not less than 15 per
cent of the issued shares of the class, being persons who did not consent to or vote for the
resolution to vary, may apply to the court to have the variation cancelled (s 633). If such
application is made, the variation has no effect until confirmed by the court.

Alteration of share capital
Application to the court must be made within 21 days after the date on which the resolution was passed or the consent given (s 633(4)). It may be made on behalf of all the dissentients by one or more of them appointed in writing. The variation then has no effect unless and
until confirmed by the court (s 633(3)). The courtâ€™s power on hearing a petition for cancellation of a variation of class rights is limited to approving or disallowing the variation. The court
cannot amend the variation or approve it subject to conditions.
The company must send to the Registrar within 15 days of the making of the court order,
a copy of that order embodying the courtâ€™s decision on the matter of variation (s 635(1)).
Alteration of share capital
A companyâ€™s share capital may be altered or increased provided the company follows the
appropriate methods and procedures.
1 Alteration of share capital
A limited company, having a share capital, may not alter its share capital except in the ways
outlined in s 617 of the Companies Act 2006.
2 Consolidation of capital
According to s 618, a limited company may consolidate its capital by amalgamating shares
of smaller amount into shares of larger amount (e.g. by consolidating groups of 20 shares of
nominal value 5p into shares of nominal value Â£1). It is rarely that a company needs to consolidate, the tendency being to subdivide and go for lower nominal values which makes the
shares easier to sell, since shares in public companies generally sell on the Stock Exchange for
more than nominal value.
Section 619 goes on to note that notice of consolidation must be given to the Registrar
within one month, specifying the shares affected. In addition, s 619(2) states that this must be
accompanied by a statement of capital, which under s 619(3) must state:
(a) the total number of shares of the company;
(b) the aggregate nominal value of those shares;
(c) for each class of shares; (i) prescribed particulars of the rights attached to the shares;
(ii) the total number of shares of that class; and (iii) the aggregate nominal value of shares
of that class; and
(d) the amount paid up and the amount unpaid on each share.
3 Subdivision of shares
This would occur, for example, where a company subdivides every Â£1 share into 10 shares of
10p each. However, the proportions of amounts paid and unpaid must remain the same
where the shares are partly paid. For example, if before subdivision every Â£1 share was 50p
paid, then the new shares of 10p each must be treated as 5p paid. The company cannot regard
some of the new shares as fully paid and some as partly paid. A company may wish to

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
subdivide shares to make them more easily marketable, e.g. a share having a nominal value
of Â£1 may have a market value of Â£8 and this may restrict market dealings. If the company
subdivides its shares into shares of 10p each, the market price would be 80p per share and
dealings would be facilitated.
This is covered by ss 618-619 and follows a similar process to that outlined above for the
consolidation of capital.
4 Reduction of share capital
A limited company may reduce its share capital, by special resolution confirmed by the court
(see ss 645-651), or in the case of a private company limited by shares, by special resolution
supported by a solvency statement (see ss 642-644). Furthermore, s 641 provides that a company may not reduce its share capital if, as a result of the reduction, there would be no longer
any member of the company holding shares other than redeemable shares (see below).
Redeemable shares
Sections 684 and 689 of the Companies Act 2006 allow the issue of redeemable shares whether
equity or preference.
The provisions are designed, among other things, to encourage investment in the equity
of small businesses in circumstances where the proprietors, often members of a family, can
at an appropriate stage buy back the equity investments without parting permanently with
family control.
Issue of redeemable shares
A limited company may issue redeemable shares (s 684(1)) and may be issued as redeemable at the option of the company or the shareholder. Under s 684(2), the articles of private
limited companies may either exclude or restrict the issue of redeemable shares, but a public
limited company may only issue redeemable shares if authorised to do so by its articles
(s 684(3)).
Redeemable shares may be issued only if there are in issue other shares which cannot be
redeemed (s 684(4)). If a companyâ€™s shares were all redeemable it could redeem the whole of
its capital and end up under a board of directors with no members. This would circumvent
provisions which have already been considered in Chapter 1 and which are designed to prevent a company continuing in existence without any members.
The redemption of redeemable shares
Redeemable shares may not be redeemed unless they are fully paid (s 686(1)). The issued
capital is the creditorsâ€™ buffer and it is this figure and not the paid-up capital which must
be replaced.
The terms of the redemption may, under s 686(2), provide that the amount payable on
redemption may, by agreement between the company and the holder of the shares, be paid
on a date later than the redemption date.

Redeemable shares
Financing the redemption
Redeemable shares may only be redeemed out of distributable profits or out of the proceeds
of a fresh issue of shares (which need not be redeemable) made for the purpose (s 687(2)).
Any premium payable on redemption must be paid out of distributable profits of the company (s 867(3)), unless the shares being redeemed were issued at a premium (see below).
Section 688 provides that shares, when redeemed, are to be cancelled and this will reduce
the issued share capital of the company by the nominal value of the shares redeemed.
If the shares being redeemed were themselves issued at a premium, then s 687(4) provides
that any premium on their redemption may be paid out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of
shares made for the purposes of redemption up to an amount equal to:
(a) the aggregate of the premiums received by the company on the issue of the shares
redeemed; or
(b) the current amount of the companyâ€™s share premium account (including any sum transferred to that account in respect of premiums on the new shares) whichever is the less.
Furthermore, under s 687(5), the amount of the companyâ€™s share premium account shall be
reduced by a sum corresponding (or by sums in the aggregate corresponding) to the amount
of any payment made out of the proceeds of the issue of the new shares.
The object of the above provisions is to tighten protection for creditors on a redemption
âž¨ See p. 162 (or purchase, see Chapter 8 âž¨) of shares.
In company law the creditorsâ€™ buffer, as it is called, is the companyâ€™s share capital plus
non-distributable reserves (i.e. reserves that cannot be written off to pay dividends, such as
the capital redemption reserve and the share premium account). Under the above formula the
share premium account can only be written down to the extent of the amount of the new issue
of shares that will replace the amount so written down, thus replacing with share capital what
has been written off the share premium account and so preserving the buffer.
Miscellaneous matters relating to redeemable shares
Time of redemption
Redeemable shares can be made redeemable between certain dates. The holder thus knows
that his shares cannot be redeemed before the earlier of the two dates, which is normally a
number of years after the issue of the shares, in order to give him an investment which will
last for a reasonable period. He also knows that the shares are bound to be redeemed by the
later of the two dates mentioned.
However, there are no legal provisions requiring the company to fix the time of redemption at the time of issue though as we have seen there is no reason why this should not be done
by, for instance, making the shares redeemable at the option of the company between stated
dates. Section 685 provides that the redemption of shares may be effected in such a manner
as may be provided by the companyâ€™s articles or by a resolution of the company.
As regards failure to redeem (or purchase) its shares, a company cannot be liable in damages for such a failure. The shareholder may obtain an order for specific performance unless
the company can show that it cannot meet the cost of redemption out of distributable profits.
In addition, following statements by Megarry J in Re Holders Investment Trust[1971] 2 All
ER 289, a shareholder whose shares are not redeemed on the agreed date may be able to obtain
an injunction to prevent the company from paying dividends either to ordinary shareholders

Chapter 7 The capital of a company
or to any subordinate class of preference shareholder until the redemption has been carried
out. Re Holdersalso confirms that such a shareholder may petition for a winding-up under
s 122 of the Insolvency Act 1986 - the just and equitable ground.
If the company goes into liquidation and at the date of commencement of the winding-up
has failed to meet an obligation to redeem (or purchase) its own shares, and this obligation
occurred before the commencement of the winding-up, the terms of the redemption (or
purchase) can be enforced by the shareholder against the company as a deferred debt in the
liquidation, but not if during the period between the due date for redemption (or purchase)
and the date of commencement of the winding-up the company could not have lawfully made
âž¨ See p. 162 a distribution (see further Chapter 8 âž¨) equal in value to the price at which the shares were
to have been redeemed (or purchased).
Any money owed is deferred to claims of all creditors and preference shareholders having
rights to capital which rank in preference to the shares redeemed (or purchased) but ranks in
front of the claims of other shareholders.
Notice to the Registrar of redemption
Notice of redemption must be given, under s 689, to the Registrar within one month of the
redemption. Failure to do so is an offence covered by s 689(5).

Capital maintenance - generally

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
The acceptance by English company law of the concept of limited liability has led to a need
to protect the capital contributed by the members of such a company since those members cannot be required to contribute funds to enable the company to pay its debts once they
have paid for their shares in full.
A creditor of a company must expect that the companyâ€™s capital may be lost because of
business misfortune. However, he can also expect that the companyâ€™s shares will be paid for
in full and that the company will not return the capital to its members.
Company legislation therefore deals with the legal freedom which companies have to
reduce their share capital, focusing on such issues as the protection of the creditorsâ€™ fund and
the class rights of members such as preference shareholders; for which both groups would
appear vulnerable within the context of capital reduction.
Borlandâ€™s Trusteev Steel Bros & Co Ltd[1901] 1 Ch 279
The plaintiff was the trustee in bankruptcy of Mr J. E. Borland, and he claimed a declaration that
the defendant company were not entitled to require the transfer of certain shares held by the
bankrupt at any price whatever, and that the transfer articles of the company purporting to give
them power to compel such transfer were void. He also claimed an injunction to restrain the company, their officers and agents, from calling for, enforcing, or effecting, a transfer of all or any of
the bankruptâ€™s ordinary shares at any price, or, alternatively, at any price less than the fair and
actual value of such shares. Farwell J stated:
It is said that the provisions of these articles compel a man at any time during the continuance of this
company to sell his shares to particular persons at a particular price to be ascertained in the manner
prescribed in the articles. Two arguments have been founded on that. It is said, first of all, that such
provisions are repugnant to absolute ownership. It is said, further, that they tend to perpetuity. They are
likened to the case of a settlor or testator who settles or gives a sum of money subject to executory
limitations which are to arise in the future, interpreting the articles as if they provided that if at any time
hereafter, during centuries to come, the company should desire the shares of a particular person, not
being a manager or assistant, he must sell them. To my mind that is applying to company law a principle
which is wholly inapplicable thereto. It is the first time that any such suggestion has been made, and
it rests, I think, on a misconception of what a share in a company really is. A share, according to the
plaintiffâ€™s argument, is a sum of money which is dealt with in a particular manner by what are called for
the purpose of argument executory limitations. To my mind it is nothing of the sort. A share is the
interest of a shareholder in the company measured by a sum of money, for the purpose of liability in the
first place, and of interest in the second, but also consisting of a series of mutual covenants entered into
by all the shareholders inter se in accordance with s. 16 of the Companies Act, 1862. The contract contained in the articles of association is one of the original incidents of the share. A share is not a sum
of money settled in the way suggested, but is an interest measured by a sum of money and made up of
various rights contained in the contract, including the right to a sum of money of a more or less amount.
Held - the article was valid and enforceable. The rule against perpetuities had no application to
personal contracts such as this.
Reduction of capital
A company limited by shares may only reduce its share capital in accordance with the procedures outlined in ss 641-653 (Chapter 10 of Part 16) of the Companies Act 2006 as stated in
s 617(2)(b). In this regard, s 641 states that a limited company may reduce its share capital:

Reduction of capital
(a) in the case of a private company limited by shares, by special resolution supported by a
solvency statement (ss 642-644);
(b) in any case, by a special resolution confirmed by the court (ss 645-651).
Once again, as noted in the previous chapter, s 641(2) underlines the fact that a company may
not reduce its share capital if, as a result of the reduction, the only remaining shares held by
members consisted entirely of redeemable shares.
Section 641(3) of the 2006 Act states that a company may reduce its share capital â€˜in any
wayâ€™, which may, in certain instances, lead to issues surrounding the possible variation or
abrogation of class rights. Indeed, there are many examples of variations in share capital being
linked with class rights. For instance, in Re Northern Engineering Industries plc[1993] BCLC
1151 the High Court decided that the rights of preference shareholders were to be regarded
as varied by a reduction of capital in which the capital paid up on their shares was to be paid
off and the shares cancelled. It could not be successfully argued that the word â€˜reductionâ€™
referred only to a situation in which the reduction was to a figure above zero. Therefore, the
reduction had to be approved by class meetings of the companyâ€™s three classes of preference
shareholders.
General procedure for a reduction of capital
Section 641(1)(b) states that all limited companies may reduce their share capital by a special
resolution confirmed by the court (ss 645-651). It is worth noting two points at this stage.
First of all, the involvement of the court is designed so as to protect the interests of the companyâ€™s creditors as well as those of any minority shareholders who may suffer as a result of
such proposals. Secondly, it is worth noting that the previous requirement under s 135 of the
Companies Act 1985 that the company has power under its articles of association to reduce
its capital has been removed, streamlining the process involved.
The most obvious point to note is the fact that securing a special resolution may prove
difficult for a company to achieve, especially where it chooses to undertake a reduction of
capital which does not impact on all classes of shares in a similar fashion (see discussion in
âž¨ See p. 144 the previous chapter âž¨). There is also the added complication of s 630 which states that if
class rights are to be varied or abrogated then the company may be accomplished this only:
(a) in accordance with provisions in the companyâ€™s articles for the variation of class rights;
(b) where the companyâ€™s articles contain no such provision, if the holders of shares of that
class consent to the variation in accordance with this section.
Furthermore, s 630(4) goes on to provide that the consent required under s 630(2)(b) is
either (a) consent in writing from the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of
the issued shares of that class; or (b) a special resolution, passed at a separate general meeting
of the holders of that class, sanctioning the variation. Consequently, a resolution to vary the
rights of a particular class is of no legal effect unless the consent of the class is obtained.
The question arises as to whether the reduction of share capital, in particular the reduction
of a companyâ€™s preference shares, falls within the scope of s 630. In this regard, it may be
noted that s 645 only requires a copy of the resolution of the company (and not of the specific
class). As such, there is an argument that the court could, in theory, approve such a reduction
that impacts on class rights. However, in practice, this would not take place as the general

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
principle is that the court will require that the proposed reduction treats all shareholders equitably; Re Ransomes Plc[1999] 2 BCLC 591, CA.
Re Ransomes Plc[1999] 2 BCLC 591, CA
T agreed to take over RIC. The deal was structured so that a subsidiary of T, A, would acquire all
of the ordinary shares in the company, most of its preference shares, and most of its convertible
stock. An Australian company, W, was holder of preference shares. The proposal was to distribute
shares to A and, inter alia, to cancel the share premium account. An extraordinary general meeting was called to approve this plan. W petitioned the court under the Companies Act 1985 s 137
to object that the proposal had not been explained in sufficiently clear terms and that the proposals had been generally put forward with undue haste. W further contended that the cancellation of the share premium account benefited the ordinary shareholders to the detriment of the
preferred shareholders.
Held - dismissing the application - an application under s 137 was not equivalent to ordinary
litigation, given that many such applications were made by one party only. The court was required
to give its approval under s 137 to proposed restructurings and therefore the applicant would be
subject to a duty of full and frank disclosure which should not be diluted in any way. It was within
the ambit of the discretion of the trial judge to decide, as he had done, that the proposal was fair
and that it did not prejudice the rights of preferred shareholders to receipt of future dividends.
There had not been any deliberate lack of openness in the companyâ€™s dealings with the court and
therefore the judge was entitled to sanction the cancellation on the material before him.
The judge approved a reduction even though there was short notice of the meeting to pass the
special resolution (without formal member approval). He did so, he said, because, in fact, the vast
majority of the shareholders approved of the reduction. However, he warned that other companies
would not be advised to infringe the procedural rules, especially where a significant minority was
likely to withhold their consent.
If one considers the interests of the companyâ€™s creditors, then according to s 645(2), if a proposed reduction of capital involves either (a) diminution of liability in respect of unpaid share
capital; or (b) the payment to a shareholder of any paid-up share capital, then s 646 will apply
unless the court directs otherwise.
Section 646 goes on to outline that every creditor of the company who at the time is entitled to any debt or claim, that would be admissible in proof against the company if it were
to be wound-up, is entitled to object to the reduction in capital. In this regard, s 646(2) provides that the court shall settle a list of creditors entitled to object and is supported by s 647
which outlines the fact that it is an offence for an officer of the company to intentionally or
recklessly conceal the name of a creditor entitled to object to the reduction of capital. If such
an omission does in fact occur and a creditor discovers that they have been omitted from the
list, s 653 provides that every person who was a member of the company at the date on which
the resolution took effect under s 649(3) is liable to contribute for the payment of the debt
The general position under s 648(2) is that the court must not confirm the reduction of
capital unless all of the creditors who have objected to the proposed reduction have consented,
or their claims have been discharged or secured by the company (see Re Lucania Temperance
Billiard Halls(London)Ltd[1966] Ch 98).

Reduction of capital
However, it should also be noted that s 646 does not automatically guarantee the position
of creditors, since s 646(4) provides that the court may, if it thinks fit, dispense with the consent of a creditor securing payment of his debt or claim. Equally, s 648(1) provides that the
court may make an order confirming the reduction of capital â€˜on such terms and conditions
as it thinks fitâ€™. With respect to this latter section, it may work both for and against the company, in essence providing that it is up to the court to determine the basis for a proposed
reduction of its share capital.
Following confirmation by the court, s 649 provides on production of an order of the court
confirming the reduction of a companyâ€™s share capital and the delivery of a copy of the order
and of a statement of capital approved by the court, the Registrar shall register the order and
statement. (This is subject to the effect of s 650 on public limited companies.) Furthermore,
under s 649(2), the statement of capital must outline:
(a) the total number of shares of the company;
(b) the aggregate nominal value of those shares;
(c) for each class of shares; (i) prescribed particulars of the rights attached to the shares;
(ii) the total number of shares of that class; and (iii) the aggregate nominal value of shares
of that class; and
(d) the amount paid up and the amount unpaid on each share.
Finally, according to s 649(4), notice of the registration of the order and statement of capital must be published in such a manner as the court may direct. Once registration has taken
place, the order confirming the reduction will take effect (s 649).
Procedure available to private companies
The Companies Act 2006 introduces an alternative procedure for the reduction of capital by
private companies, for which court confirmation is not needed and as such seeks to minimise
the cost and time associated with securing confirmation from the courts. However, with
respect to public limited companies, the law remains unchanged.
Section 641(1)(a) states that a private company may reduce its share capital by special
resolution supported by a solvency statement.
The solvency statement must be in the prescribed form (s 643(3)) and the details required
within it are outlined in s 643 and are based on the companyâ€™s current and future financial
positions. First of all, each of the directors must form the opinion that there is no ground on
which the company could be found to be unable to pay its debts. Secondly, the statement
requires them to form an opinion relating to one year into the future, in that:
(a) if it is intended to commence the winding up of the company within 12 months of that
date, that the company will be able to pay its debts in full within 12 months of the commencement of winding-up; or
(b) in any other case, that the company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due during the
year immediately following the date of this statement.
This is further supported by s 643(2) which outlines the fact that when forming these
opinions, the directors must take into account all of the companyâ€™s liabilities including
any contingent or prospective liabilities. (It is worth comparing this requirement with the
wording of s 123(1)(e) of the Insolvency Act 1986 whereby there is a noticeable similarity
in approach.)

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
In addition, s 643(5) provides that an offence is committed by every officer who makes a
solvency statement without having reasonable grounds for the opinions expressed therein.
This reinforces the responsibility that has been placed on directors if this particular choice of
approach is pursued by a company as opposed to seeking confirmation by the courts; the
criminal sanctions outlined in s 643(5) reinforce the importance attached to the accuracy of
the solvency statement.
Following the resolution to reduce its share capital, the company must within 15 days,
deliver to the Registrar a copy of the solvency statement and a statement of capital (s 644(1)).
With regards to the statement of capital, it must state with respect to the companyâ€™s share
capital as reduced by the resolution (s 644(2)):
(a) the total number of shares of the company;
(b) the aggregate nominal value of those shares;
(c) for each class of shares; (i) prescribed particulars of the rights attached to the shares;
(ii) the total number of shares of that class; and (iii) the aggregate nominal value of shares
of that class; and
(d) the amount paid up and the amount unpaid on each share.
With respect to the solvency statement, s 644(5) provides that the directors must deliver to
the Registrar within 15 days after the resolution is passed, a statement confirming that the
solvency statement was (a) not made more than 15 days before the date on which the resolution was passed; and (b) provided to members in accordance with s 642(2) or (3). If this
latter issue is not complied with, then s 644(7) provides that an offence is committed by every
officer of the company who is in default. Equally, if there is a delay in the process which takes
the solvency statement outside the parameters set down by this section, the directors will be
required to review and republish their solvency statement so as to comply with s 644(1).
Finally, s 644(3) provides that the Registrar must register the documents delivered to him
under s 644(1) on receipt, with the resolution taking effect once registration (and, in essence,
once the documentation has been made public) has taken place (s 644(4)).
Types of reduction
Under s 641 share capital can be reduced â€˜in any wayâ€™. The section, however, envisages three
forms of reduction in particular (see s 641(4)):
(a) to extinguish or reduce the liability on any of its shares in respect of share capital not paid up;
(b) either with or without extinguishing or reducing liability on any of its shares, cancel any
paid-up share capital that is lost or unrepresented by available assets;
(c) either with or without extinguishing or reducing liability on any of its shares, repay any
paid-up share capital in excess of the companyâ€™s wants.
In the first and third forms of reduction, it is clear that the creditors of the company are
potentially in a worse position than prior to the reduction, thus falling within the intended
scope of s 646 as outlined above. However, the second situation would appear to involve the
company bringing its legal capital in line with its net asset position and as such not having the
same impact on creditors. It is worth considering that s 641(4) enables a company to reduce
for the reasons set out below:
(a) The company may have more capital than it needs and may wish to return some of it
to shareholders. For example, a company may wish to return paid-up capital which is in

Reduction of capital
excess of its requirements where it has sold a part of its undertaking and intends in the
future to confine its activities to running the remaining part of its business. The company
may achieve its purpose by reducing the nominal value of its shares. Suppose that before
the reduction the company had a share capital of 50,000 shares of Â£1 each, fully paid. On
reduction it could substitute a share capital of 50,000 shares of 50p each fully paid, and
return 50p per share in cash to the members.
(b) Share capital already issued may not be fully paid and yet the company may have all
the capital it needs. Reduction in these circumstances may be effected as follows. If the
companyâ€™s share capital before reduction was 50,000 shares of Â£1 each, 50p paid, the company may reduce it to 50,000 shares of 50p each fully paid. However, liability for unpaid
capital cannot be reduced by crediting a partly paid share as paid up to a greater extent
than it has in fact been paid up (Re Development Co of Central and West Africa[1902]
Ch 547). Thus, it is not possible to leave the nominal value of the shares at Â£1 and cancel
one share from every two held by shareholders, regarding the remaining one of the two
as fully paid.
(c) Where the assets have suffered a realised loss as in Re Jupiter House Investments(Cambridge)
Ltd[1985] 1 WLR 975 where the company had incurred a substantial loss on the sale of
some of its property. In such a case a share capital of 50,000 shares of Â£1 each fully paid
could be reduced to 50,000 shares of 50p each fully paid and no capital would be returned
to shareholders.
(d) To comply with the law relating to distributions. The provisions relating to reduction
have been increasingly used in more recent times to comply with the law relating to distributions, under which companies cannot pay a dividend unless and until any deficit on
the profit and loss account is made good. In such a situation the company may wish to
cancel a share premium account in order to offset a capital loss. Let us suppose that there
is a balance of Â£5,000 in the P and L account, but the company has sold assets at a loss
and suffered a realised loss of Â£6,000. There is, in effect, a deficit of Â£1,000 on the P and
L account and no dividend can be paid. But if the company has a share premium account
of Â£2,000, it can ask the court to approve a reduction in that account and write off the
capital loss against it.
Payment of shareholders on reduction
The matter of repayment of shareholders should be treated as if the company was being
wound up. Thus, if the capital is being repaid for the reasons given in methods (a) and (b),
the preference shareholders should be paid or reduced first if they have priority in a windingup. If the reduction is due to loss of assets, the ordinary shareholders should be paid or
reduced before the preference shareholders. This order, however, may be varied if the preference shareholders consent. The court has no discretion to confirm a reduction without
separate class meetings of the shareholders affected.
Prudential Assurance Co Ltdv Chatterley-Whitfield Colliers Ltd[1949] AC 512
Under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, the undertaking of a colliery company carrying
on business in England became vested in the National Coal Board, subject to the payment of compensation, the amount of which had not yet been assessed. The company intended thereafter to
carry on a colliery business in Eire and Northern Ireland and engaged in prospecting with that end

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
in view. Its capital being considered larger than was required, it was proposed to reduce it by paying off, out of reserves, the whole of the preference capital. By Art 7 of the articles of association
the holders of preference shares had the right, in the event of a winding-up of the company, to
repayment of capital in priority to the claims of the holders of ordinary shares but they were given
no other rights to participate in the assets of the company. Viscount Maugham stated:
My Lords, the facts in this appeal are sufficiently stated in the speech of my noble and learned friend
Lord Simonds and no useful purpose would be served by my repeating them. It is not in dispute that
if the company had thought fit to pass a voluntary resolution for a winding up or to do so in the near
future the rights of the preference shareholders (apart from any possible action by the Tribunal
appointed under s 25 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946) would be to receive a repayment
of their share capital together with any arrears of preference dividend and they would have no other
right to participate in the assets of the company. The unusual position is that the appellants as holders of a substantial number of preference shares object to the proposed reduction of capital by a
repayment in full of their preference capital. Desiring to retain their preference shares though the
undertaking of the company has been entirely changed, they invite the court to hold that the proposed
repayment is unfair and inequitable and that the reduction ought not therefore to be approved. They
acquired their shares on the footing that, subject no doubt to the approval of the court, they might be
paid off under Art 43; but this they urge at the Bar is not the occasion or the method which should be
adopted for such a reduction. They perhaps wisely do not tell us when that course would in their view
be appropriate.
My Lords I do not propose to restate the grounds on which the majority in the Court of Appeal or
my noble friends in this House have declined to accept this contention; but I should like to add a few
observations of my own; for the simplest arguments sometimes escape attention merely because
they are assumed. In the present case the main fact is that the undertaking of the company has been
compulsorily acquired by the National Coal Board under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act. There
is no longer therefore any reason for the retention by the company of the assets and funds of great
value which have been slowly added to year by year with a view to meeting contingencies or spending
enormous sums in improving or reconstructing or enlarging the colliery undertaking. The obvious thing
to do would be to wind up and distribute all the assets after paying debts and liabilities in accordance
with the articles. It is not I think suggested that the holders of preference shares could properly object
to such a course. They would cease to own a well-secured 6 per cent investment, and the ordinary
shareholders would no longer possess shares paying in recent years double that amount in dividend.
The object of the Coal Ind ustry Nationalisation Act was not of course the benefit of shareholders, but
if we ask whether in this case preference or ordinary shareholders are the most injured by the transfer, subject to compensation, of the colliery undertaking to a State enterprise, I think the current view
of commercial men would probably be that the ordinary shareholders are the greater victims.
The company, however, does not propose to go into liquidation, at any rate at present, but to
embark on two entirely new ventures in Eire and Northern Ireland, one of them a new colliery, if
prospective operations should prove satisfactory, and the other the business of digging for clay
and the manufacture of tiles and like articles. The working capital necessary for those enterprises is
only a fraction of the available existing funds of the company; accordingly the special resolution duly
passed by the company in general meeting on 30 October 1947, provided for the reducing the
capital of the company from 400,000 lto 200,000 lby returning to the preference shareholders the
amounts paid up on their shares. It is in my opinion from the point of view of those shareholders
an accidental circumstance that a large majority of the ordinary shareholders have approved of the
starting of two entirely new and it may be highly speculative enterprises with which the preference
shareholders, if the reduction goes through, will obviously have no concern. If the preference shares
are not paid off, and the new undertaking proved to be a success, the preference shares would
become more and more valuable as the assets of the company became increasingly substantial. If on
the other hand the undertaking were unsuccessful, those shares might nevertheless be worth par in
a winding up while the ordinary share might have become valueless. The risk in short would be the
risk of the ordinary shareholders, while the gain might well be that of the preference shareholders.

Reduction of capital
That proposal does not commend itself to me as a fair one; and the same objection, with smaller
figures affected, must apply to a proposal for a pari passureduction of the ordinary and the preference shares. In short, like my noble friend Lord Simonds, I am at a loss to see what other method of
reduction is to be preferred as more fair and equitable in the circumstances of this case.
The question of the effect of s 25 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act on the present case
is one with which your Lordships have dealt in the very recent case of the Scottish Insurance
Corporation Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd. That was also the case of a company whose
undertaking was a colliery; and the dispute, as here, was between two classes of shareholders; but
that company proposes to go into liquidation as soon as the amount of compensation payable under
the Coal Industry Nationalization Act has been ascertained, and the preference shareholders were
claiming (but unsuccessfully) to be entitled to rank equally in the winding up with the ordinary shareholders in the surplus assets of the company, that is, in the assets available after payment of debts
and liabilities and the amounts of capital paid on the ordinary and preference shares. Counsel for the
preference shareholders there, as here, relied on s 25 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act and said
that the proposed reduction of capital deprived the preference shareholders of their right to an adjustment of their interest in the companyâ€™s assets. Your Lordships have now dealt with the appeal in that
case and have considered the regulations which have now been made under s 25. They have held
that there was no ground in that case for postponing the decision of the court on the petition before
the court; and they were not persuaded that there was good reason for thinking that the apparent
fairness of the proposal before the court would be affected or displaced by any order which was in
the least likely to be made under the jurisdiction derived from s 25. The reduction here proposed, in
my opinion, is in itself fair and equitable, and there is here, as in the previous case, no real ground for
the speculation that the Tribunal might give the preference shareholders anything more than they
would become entitled to receive in a liquidation.
In my opinion therefore this appeal should be dismissed with costs.
Held- the reduction proposed was fair and equitable and should be confirmed and that there was
no ground to suppose that under s 25 of the Act of 1946 that preference shareholders might
receive anything more than they would have been entitled to receive in a liquidation.
If priority is given to the different classes of shares in accordance with their terms of issue,
then no separate class meeting is necessary to approve a reduction of the companyâ€™s share
capital, (subject to the specific terms of a companyâ€™s articles of association), (Re Saltdean
Estate Co Ltd [1968] 1 W LR 1844).
Re Saltdean Estate Co Ltd[1968] 1 WLR 1844
A companyâ€™s capital consisted of 20,000 preferred shares of 10 shillings each, and 50,000 ordinary shares of 1s each. By Art 8 of the articles of association, in order to â€˜affect, modify, deal with
or abrogate in any mannerâ€™ the rights and privileges attaching to any particular class of shares, an
extraordinary resolution, passed at a separate general meeting of the members of that class, was
required, the quorum necessary at such meeting being members holding or representing by proxy
three-fourths of the capital paid up, or credited as paid up, on the issued shares of that class.
Article 21 provided that â€˜the net profits of the company which the directors shall determine to distribute by way of dividend in any yearâ€™ should be applied, first, in paying a dividend of 10 per cent
on the preferred shares, secondly, in distributing to the ordinary shareholders an amount equivalent to the total sum paid as dividend to the preferred shareholders, and thirdly, â€˜the balance of
profitsâ€™ was to be divided equally between the preferred and ordinary shareholders.
Article 24 provided that, on a winding up, the preferred shareholders were first to receive the
capital paid up on their shares, then â€˜the surplus assets (if any)â€™ were to be applied in repayment
of the capital paid up, or credited as paid up, on the ordinary shares, â€˜the excess (if any)â€™ to be

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
distributed among the ordinary shareholders in proportion to their shareholding, at the commencement of the winding-up. Every share carried one vote at a general meeting and consequently the ordinary shareholders could carry an ordinary resolution, but not a special or
extraordinary resolution, against the holders of the preferred shares, if all the latter opposed it.
On 8 July 1968, at an extraordinary general meeting of the company, a special resolution was
passed to reduce the capital of the company by repaying the capital paid up on the preferred
shares, together with a premium of 5s per share out of money surplus to the companyâ€™s needs. No
separate meeting of the preferred shareholders had been held, but the owner of all, or virtually all,
of the ordinary shares approved the proposal, and a large number of the preferred shares were
held by the holder or holders of the ordinary shares. The companyâ€™s business was very profitable,
and dividends totalling 1,000 per cent had been paid to the preferred shareholders during the
seven years ending 30 September 1966, and a further 100 per cent gross had been proposed for
the period from 1 October 1966, to 31 March 1968, at which date Â£324,924 stood to the credit of
the revenue reserve, from which, if it were to be distributed, the preferred shareholders would
receive 1,625 per cent on their shares. Some preferred shares had, however, been sold during
1966 and 1967 at 11s per share.
A petition seeking the courtâ€™s sanction to the proposed reduction was opposed by the holder
of 80 preferred shares on the grounds (1) that it was an abrogation of the rights attached to the
preferred shares which required an extraordinary resolution to be passed at a separate class meeting, and that no such meeting had been held; (2) that the failure to obtain the preferred shareholdersâ€™ approval prevented the dissentient minority from availing themselves of the protection
intended to be given by s 72 of the Companies Act 1948, and (3) that it was unfair in that it discriminated against the holders of the preferred shares by preventing them from sharing in the fruits
either of the companyâ€™s future or its past prosperity; that the preferred shares were, in truth, a form
of â€˜equityâ€™ capital, and that the undistributed trading profits belonged to the two classes of shares
equally, and were not included in the â€˜surplus assetsâ€™ referred to in Art 24. It was further contended
that there was no present prospect of the company being wound up and that continued large
distributions of profits were to be anticipated.
Held -(1) The proposed reduction of the companyâ€™s capital, by means of the cancellation of the
preferred shares, was in accordance with the rights attaching to the preferred shares, and was not
an abrogation of those rights within the meaning of Art 8 of the companyâ€™s articles of association,
and that the liability to prio r repayment, forming as it did an integral part of the bundle of rights
which went to make up a preferred share, was a liability, of which a person had only himself to
blame if he were unaware.
(2) Section 72 of the Companies Act 1948 had no application, since it related to a variation and not
to a cancellation of share rights.
(3) That on the true construction of the companyâ€™s articles of association, Arts 21 and 24 were not
inconsistent with each other; that the â€˜balance of profitsâ€™, which, under Art 21, was divisible equally
between the preferred and ordinary shareholders, related solely to the â€˜net profits which the directorsâ€™ should â€˜determine to distributeâ€™ and not to the undistributed profits, and that the natural
meaning of Art 24 was that all the property of the company available for distribution in a windingup, and remaining, after repaying all the paid-up capital, belonged to the ordinary shareholders.
(4) That, therefore, despite the fact that there was no prospect of a winding-up of the company,
and that continued large distributions of profits, were to be anticipated, the proposed reduction of
capital was not discriminatory or unfair to the preferred shareholders.
It should also be noted that if a company has created reserves by the transfer of retained
profits and subsequently suffers a loss of assets, it is the usual practice to write off the loss
against the reserves and to reduce share capital only if the reserves are insufficient. Again,

Acquisition of own shares - generally
where the company has capital reserves such as a share premium account or a capital redemption reserve, the practice is to write off losses against them before reducing share capital.
Losses may be written off against revenue reserves by making an appropriate adjustment
in the accounts but as we have seen, losses may only be written off by reducing the share
premium account or capital redemption reserve if the same steps are taken as are required
for reducing share capital.
Acquisition of own shares - generally
Section 658 of the Companies Act 2006 prohibits a company (whether public or private) from
acquiring its own shares (whether by purchase, subscription or otherwise), except in accordance with the provisions of Part 18 of the Act. This confirms the common law rule that a
company cannot purchase its own shares; Trevorv Whitworth(1887) 12 App Cas 409 HL, in
which Lord Watson observed:
One of the main objects contemplated by the legislature, in restricting the power of limited
companies to reduce the amount of their capital as set forth in the memorandum, is to protect
the interests of the outside public who may become their creditors. In my opinion the effect of
these statutory restrictions is to prohibit every transaction between a company and a shareholder, by means of which the money already paid to the company in respect of his shares is
returned to him, unless the Court has sanctioned the transaction. Paid-up capital may be
diminished or lost in the course of the companyâ€™s trading; that is a result which no legislation
can prevent; but persons who deal with, and give credit to a limited company, naturally rely
upon the fact that the company is trading with a certain amount of capital already paid, as well
as upon the responsibility of its members for the capital remaining at call; and they are entitled
to assume that no part of the capital which has been paid into the coffers of the company has
been subsequently paid out, except in the legitimate course of its business.
When a share is forfeited or surrendered, the amount which has been paid upon it remains
with the company, the shareholder being relieved of liability for future calls, whilst the share
itself reverts to the company, bears no dividend, and may be re-issued. When shares are purchased at par, and transferred to the company, the result is very different. The amount paid
up on the shares is returned to the shareholder; and in the event of the company continuing to
hold the shares (as in the present case) is permanently withdrawn from its trading capital.
It appears to me that, as the late Master of the Rolls pointed out in In re Dronfield Silkstone Coal
Company, it is inconsistent with the essential nature of a company that it should become a
member of itself. It cannot be registered as a shareholder to the effect of becoming debtor to
itself for calls, or of being placed on the list of contributories in its own liquidation.
Under s 658(2) if a company purports to act in contravention of this section, an offence is
committed by the company and every officer in default. The purported acquisition is also
void. It should also be noted that the Companies Act 2006 reinforces this rule with further
restrictions:
(a) First of all, according to s 660(2), if the company seeks to avoid the restriction imposed
by s 658 by getting a nominee to purchase the shares in question, the shares will be treated
as being held by that nominee on his own account and that the company is to be regarded
as having no beneficial interest in them. This is particularly relevant as such arrangements

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
could in the past be engineered by the directors to keep themselves in secret control so
that when faced with a takeover bid they could frustrate the bidder by arranging for shares
to be acquired by nominees of the company, sometimes without too much attention as
to when and how they were to be paid for, who would, of course, refuse to accept the bid.
Section 661 goes a stage further and provides that if the nominee fails to meet his
financial responsibilities associated with the shares within 21 days of being called on to
do so, then:
(i) In the case of shares that he agreed to take as a subscriber to the memorandum, the
other subscribers to the memorandum are jointly and severally liable with him to pay
that amount; and
(ii) In any other case, the directors of the company when the shares were issued to or
acquired by him are jointly and severally liable with him to pay that amount.
Relief may be granted by the court under s 661(4) in cases where a subscriber or a
director would otherwise be liable, if it appears to the court that he acted honestly and
reasonably and he ought fairly to be excused, taking into account all the circumstances
of the case. The relief may be granted either in any proceedings for the recovery of any
amount due or upon the application of a subscriber or a director in anticipation of such
proceedings.
(b) According to s 670, a lien or other charge of a public company on its own shares is void,
except as permitted by this section.
(c) Section 136(1)(a) provides that a company cannot be a member of its holding company,
either directly or indirectly by way of a nominee (s 144). Furthermore, under s 136(1)(b),
any allotment or transfer of shares in the holding company to the subsidiary or its nominee is void. Exceptions to this rule are outlined in s 138 (subsidiary acting as personal
representative or trustee), and s 141 (subsidiary acting as authorised dealer in securities).
In addition, s 137 provides that this prohibition does not apply where a company is not
a subsidiary at the time of acquisition of the shares but at a later stage becomes one.
(d) Where a public limited company, or nominee of the company, acquires its own shares
and those shares are shown in a balance sheet of the company as an asset, then s 669(1)
provides that â€˜an amount equal to the value of the shares must be transferred out of
the profits available for dividend to a reserve fund; this amount not being available for
distributionâ€™. In other words, this amount is available to protect the interests of the
companyâ€™s creditors.
The exceptions to the rule prohibiting a limited company from acquiring its own shares are
contained in s 659 and may be summarised as follows:
(a) the acquisition of shares in a reduction of capital duly made;
(b) the purchase of shares in accordance with a court order under s 98, s 721(6), s 759, and
Part 30 of the Act (see below for discussion of unfair prejudice and protection of members);
(c) the forfeiture of shares or the acceptance of shares surrendered in lieu under provisions
in the articles for failure to pay any sum payable in respect of those shares.
In addition, s 659(1) provides that a company may acquire any of its own fully paid shares
otherwise than for valuable consideration. In other words, the company may acquire them by
way of a gift.
The issue of redeemable shares has already been covered in the previous chapter as an
exception to this general rule.

Purchase of own shares
Finally, as noted above, under Part 30 of the 2006 Act, a company may be ordered by the
court to acquire shares from a shareholder as a remedy under the unfair prejudice provisions
contained in ss 994-996.
Purchase of own shares
Formerly the rule of capital maintenance designed to protect creditors prevented a limited
company from using its resources to purchase its own shares from its shareholders. This principle first appeared in case law, the leading case being Trevorv Whitworth(1887) 12 App Cas
409, and later in company legislation. The strictness of that rule was later relaxed and purchase by a company of its own shares is allowed subject to safeguards. The procedures to be
followed are set out in ss 690-708.
Section 690 provides that a limited company having a share capital may purchase its own
shares subject to the provisions of Chapter 4 of Part 18 of the Companies Act 2006 and any
restrictions or prohibitions that may be contained in the companyâ€™s articles. Furthermore,
s 691(1) sets down the same restrictions as for the redemption of shares; the shares must be
fully paid.
Why purchase own shares?
Among the most important reasons for a companyâ€™s purchase of its own shares are the following:
1 So far as private companies are concerned, it gives their shares some marketability. Individuals may be more easily persuaded to invest in private companies if they know that the
company can buy them out even if the other shareholders have insufficient resources to do so.
2 In family companies a shareholder may die or want to, in effect, resign or retire. Perhaps the
other shareholders cannot agree how many shares each should take, or they cannot afford
to buy them anyway. In order to avoid an outsider taking them the company can buy them.
3 In the case of shareholder disputes, there is now the possibility of reaching a compromise
with a member or members whereby they are bought out by the company thus avoiding
the introduction of an outsider as the price of getting rid of a disenchanted member.
4 The provision is useful also in the case of executive directors who have taken shares in the
company. Suppose a finance director has taken shares in the company but leaves at the
end of his contract for, say, a better position. The company can buy his shares so that he
truly severs his connection with the company. The shares must be cancelled, but this does
not affect the authorised capital and new shares can be issued to the next finance director
on appointment.
Types of purchase: generally
There is a â€˜market purchaseâ€™ and an â€˜off-marketâ€™ purchase. A market purchase includes only
purchases of shares subject to a marketing agreement on a recognised investment exchange
(i.e. one authorised by the Financial Services Authority: see s 693(5)). An off-market purchase
is a purchase of any other types of shares.

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
Market purchase
According to s 701(1), a company may make a market purchase of its own shares provided
that the purchase has been authorised by an ordinary resolution of the members in general
meeting. The authority must:
(a) specify the maximum number of shares which the company may acquire under the
resolution (s 701(3)(a));
(b) state the maximum and minimum prices which the company may pay for those shares.
There will normally be a minimum price set out in the resolution, but for the maximum
a formula would be used (e.g. an amount equal to 105 per cent of the average of the upper
and lower prices shown in the quotations for ordinary shares of the company in the daily
list of the London Stock Exchange on the three business days immediately preceding the
day on which the contract to purchase is made) (s 701(3)(b));
(c) specify a date when the authority given by the resolution will expire. This must not be
later than 18 months after the passing of the resolution (s 701(5)).
In addition, the authority may:
(a) be general or limited to the purchase of shares of a particular class or description
(s 701(2)(a));
(b) be unconditional or subject to conditions (s 701(2)(b)).
The authority given may be varied, revoked or renewed by a further ordinary resolution of
the members (s 701(4)).
Section 701(6) provides that a company may complete a purchase after the date of the
authority given by the ordinary resolution has expired, given that the contract for the purchase was made before the expiry date and the terms of the ordinary resolution cover execution of the contract after the expiry date.
The ordinary resolution giving the authority must be filed with the Registrar within 15 days
of being passed and a copy must be embodied in or annexed to every copy of the articles
issued thereafter (s 701(8)). This ensures that the market is aware of the companyâ€™s intentions
as well as the specific limits within which the directors may operate in terms of price, quantity and timescale.
Off-market purchases
Section 694 provides that a company may make an off-market purchase only under a specific
contract which has received advance authorisation by a special resolution of the company.
That authorisation may be varied, revoked or, if subject to a time limit, renewed by special
resolution under s 694(4) and with regard to a public company the resolution must give a date
on which the authority will expire, this being not later than 18 months after the date on which
the resolution was passed (s 694(5)).
The shareholder whose shares are being purchased should not vote the shares being
purchased on a special resolution to confer, vary, revoke or renew an authority, though
there is nothing to prevent him from voting against the resolution if he has changed his
mind (s 695(2)). If he does, the authority will not be effective unless the resolution would
have been passed with the requisite majority without his votes (s 695(3)). If he holds other
shares, then he cannot vote at all on a show of hands but can vote those shares on a poll

Purchase of own shares
âž¨ See p. 379 (see further Chapter 19 âž¨). Any member of the company may demand a poll on the resolution (s 695(4)).
According to s 696, a copy of the contract of purchase, or a memorandum of its terms if it
is not in writing, must be available for inspection by any member at the registered office for
at least 15 days prior to the date of the meeting at which the special resolution is to be passed
and available at the meeting itself, otherwise the resolution is of no effect.
The contract, or the memorandum of it, must include or have annexed to it a written
memorandum giving the names of the shareholders to which the contract relates, if they do
not appear in the contract or memorandum (s 696(3)).
The above provisions might appear to rule out the use by private companies of the unanimous written resolution procedure, since the member whose shares were being purchased
would, of necessity, be voting for the purchase in respect of all his shares. However, s 695(2)
of the 2006 Act states that the person whose shares are being purchased is not to be regarded
as a person who can vote in respect of any of his shares. So, the resolution must be agreed
unanimously by the other members and the one whose shares are being purchased is not
Furthermore, where the 2006 Act requires contracts or documents of one sort or another
to be laid before the meeting at which the resolution is passed, that provision does not
apply if the written resolution procedure is used. Instead the relevant documents must
be supplied to each member at or before the time at which the resolution is supplied to him
(s 696(2)).
A written resolution will therefore shorten the procedure since the relevant documents
are sent to the members with the resolution.
Private companies: financing the purchase out of capital
Section 709 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a private limited company may, in
accordance with Chapter 5 of Part 18 of the Act, and subject to any restriction or prohibition
in the companyâ€™s articles, make a payment in respect of the redemption or purchase of its own
shares otherwise than out of distributable profits or the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares.
Thus, a private family company could purchase the shares of a retiring member and so
keep out non-family members even though profits were insufficient to make the purchase in
full and the members of the family did not wish to subscribe to a fresh issue which would be
enough to pay the full purchase price.
This type of payment is referred to as being a payment â€˜out of capitalâ€™ (s 709(2)) but is
restricted in scope by way of s 710 which provides that payment may be made by a company
out of capital after first applying for that purpose (a) any available profits of the company; and
(b) the proceeds of any fresh issue of shares made for the purposes of the redemption or purchase, in order to meet the price of redemption or purchase. In other words, the permissible
capital payment (PCP) as per s 710(2).
Available profits are defined under s 711 of the Act as being the profits of the company that
are available for distribution (within the meaning of Part 23 of the Act) and are determined
according to the procedure outlined in s 712.
According to s 713, in order to be lawful, a payment out of capital by a private company
must satisfy the requirements of ss 714 (directorsâ€™ statement and auditorâ€™s report), 716 (approval
by way of a special resolution), 719 (public notice or proposed payment) and 720 (directorsâ€™
statement and auditorâ€™s report to be available for inspection).

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
Section 714 states that the companyâ€™s directors must make a statement, in the prescribed
form (s 714(5)), which must:
(a) specify the amount of the permissible capital payment for the shares in question (s 714(2));
(b) state that having made full inquiry into the affairs and prospects of the company, the
directors have formed the opinion:
(i) as regards its initial situation immediately following the date on which the payment
out of capital is proposed to be made, that there will be no grounds on which the
company could then be found unable to pay its debts (s 714(3)(a)); and
(ii) as regards its prospects for the year immediately following that date, that having regard
to (a) their intentions with respect to the management of the companyâ€™s business
during that year; and (b) the amount and character of the financial resources that will
in their view be available to the company during that year, that the company will be able
to continue to carry on business as a going concern throughout that year (s 714(3)(b)).
In many respects these issues are similar to those found in the solvency statement to be submitted by the directors of a private limited company on a proposed reduction of capital out
of court (see discussion of s 643 above) in that the companyâ€™s directors are required to take
into account both contingent and prospective liabilities (s 714(4)). The statement must also
have annexed to it a report from the companyâ€™s auditor (s 714(6)). It is also interesting to
note that the Act, under s 715, applies the same criminal liability for negligence as under the
insolvency statement.
A special resolution of the company is required to approve the payment out of capital
(s 716(1)) and this must be passed on, or within the week immediately following, the date
which the directors make the statement required by s 714.
Section 719 states that within the week immediately following the date of the resolution under
s 716, the company must publish in the Gazette, a notice stating that the company has
approved a payment out of capital for the purpose of acquiring its own shares by purchase (or
redemption) and specify the amount of the permissible capital payment in question and the
date of the resolution. The notice must also state where the directorsâ€™ statement and auditorâ€™s
report are available for inspection and that any creditor may, within five weeks following the
date of the resolution, apply to the court under s 721 for an order preventing the payment.
Section 720 provides that the directorsâ€™ statement and auditorâ€™s report must be kept available for inspection at the companyâ€™s registered office and give notice to the Registrar as to the
place at which these documents are being kept for inspection by any member or creditor of
the company (s 720(3),(4)).
Dissentient shareholders/creditors
If a member who has not consented to, or voted in favour of, the resolution or any creditor
of the company wishes to object, then s 721 provides that they may apply to the court for the
cancellation of the resolution.
In line with the time requirements contained in s 719, s 723(1) goes on to state that the
payment out of capital must be made no earlier than five weeks after the date on which the
resolution under s 716 is passed and no more than seven weeks after that date.

Purchase of own shares
Failure by company to purchase shares
Section 735(2) provides that a company is not liable to pay damages in respect of a failure to
purchase (or redeem) its shares. However, a shareholder may apply to the court for specific
performance of the contract of purchase (or the terms of redemption) but no order is to
be made if the company can show that it could not pay the price from distributable profits
(s 735(3)).
In a liquidation a shareholder may enforce a contract of purchase (or the terms of redemption) against the company as a deferred debt provided that the due date for purchase (or
redemption) was before the date of commencement of the winding-up, unless it is shown
that the company could not at any time between the due date for purchase (or redemption)
and the commencement of the winding-up have paid for the shares from distributable profits
(ss 735(4) and (5)).
In a winding-up, because it is a deferred debt all other debts and liabilities are paid in
priority to the purchase price (or redemption price) as are shareholders with a prior right to
return of capital (e.g. preference shareholders). Subject to that the purchase or redemption
price is paid in priority to amounts due to other members as members, e.g. share capital in a
winding-up.
Provisions to ensure preservation of capital
As noted above, companies may purchase (or redeem) shares from profits or from a fresh
issue of shares. Where the purchase or redemption is from profits, an amount equivalent
to the nominal value of the shares purchased or redeemed must be transferred to a capital
redemption reserve. Thus, the creditorsâ€™ fund is protected because the shares purchased
(or redeemed) are replaced by a new issue of shares or a capital reserve.
However, where a private limited company has made a payment out of capital, then a
transfer to the capital redemption reserve is only required to the extent that distributable
profits have been used in part to fund the purchase of shares (s 734(4)).
Permissible capital payment (PCP)
The following examples show how this is calculated in practice.
(a) Where the PCP is less than the nominal amount of the shares purchased
Here the difference must, under s 734, be transferred to Capital Redemption Reserve (CRR).
Shareholdersâ€™ funds before purchase
Share capital 100
Share premium 10
Total capital 110
Profit and loss balance 20
Net assets 130
Assume that there is now a purchase of 20 shares of Â£1 each at a premium of 50p and there is
no fresh issue of shares.

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
The PCP is - cost of purchase Â£30 less all available profits of Â£20. PCP = Â£10. The premium is written off to P & L under s 160 and the Â£10 difference between the nominal value
and the PCP is transferred to CRR as s 734 requires.
The journal entries would be as follows:
Dr Share capital 20
Dr Profit and loss a/c 10
Cr Cash 30
(being purchase of shares at a premium of 50%)
Dr Profit and loss a/c 10
(Being transfer to CRR pers 171)
Shareholdersâ€™ funds after purchase
Share capital 80
Share premium 10
Net assets 100
Net assets are reduced because we have used Â£30 of our cash to buy the shares.
(b) Where the PCP is greater than the nominal amount of the shares
Here, under s 734, the difference is written off to CRR or share premium account or revaluation reserve (if any) or even in the last analysis share capital. Suppose that in the example
given in (a) above the company had purchased 30 shares of a nominal value of Â£1 each at
Â£2 each with no fresh issue.
The PCP is - cost of purchase Â£60 less all available profits of Â£20. PCP = Â£40. The
nominal amount of the shares purchased is Â£30, so Â£10 must be written off against a capital
account. We shall take the share premium account because we do not have any other capital
reserve, but if that had not been enough we should have had to proceed to reduce the
share capital.
The journal entries would be as follows:
Dr Share capital 30
Dr Profit and loss a/c 20
Dr Share premium a/c 10
Cr Cash 60
(being purchase of 30 shares at Â£2 each in accordance with s 734)

Purchase of own shares
Shareholdersâ€™ funds after purchase
Share capital 70
Share premium -
Total capital 70
Profit and loss balance -
Net assets 70
The net assets have been reduced because we have used Â£60 of our cash to buy the shares.
The above examples apply also, with the necessary changes in nomenclature, to a redemption from capital.
Civil liability of past shareholders and directors
Section 76 of the Insolvency Act 1986 contains a limited procedure for unravelling the acquisition outlined above. If the company goes into liquidation within one year of the payment
being made to the shareholder, that person is liable to return the amount made out of capital
to the company to the extent outlined below:
(a) if winding-up takes place within 12 months of a purchase (redemption) from capital and
the companyâ€™s assets are not sufficient to pay its debts and liabilities; then
(b) the person(s) from whom the shares were purchased (or redeemed) and the directors
who signed the statutory declaration; are
(c) jointly and severally liable to contribute to the assets of the company, to the amount of
the payment received by the shareholder(s) when the company purchased (or redeemed)
the shares. There is a right of contribution between those liable in such an amount as the
court thinks just and equitable;
(d) those in (b) above, are given a right to petition for a winding-up on the grounds:
(i) that the company cannot pay its debts; and
(ii) that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.
The purpose of this is to enable them to limit the amount of their liability by initiating a
winding-up before the companyâ€™s assets are further dissipated leading to an increase in the
contribution required of them.
Directors are not liable if they had reasonable grounds for the opinion given in the directorsâ€™ statement under s 714, though the Companies Act 2006 contains its own penalties in
this regard under s 715.
Treasury shares
In general terms shares which are purchased by a company must be cancelled and the amount
of the companyâ€™s share capital account reduced by the nominal value of the cancelled shares
(s 706). As noted earlier, a company cannot usually become a member of itself.
An exception was introduced under the provisions of the Companies (Acquisition of Own
Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/1116). These have subsequently been
restated in Chapter 6 of Part 18 of the Companies Act 2006.
These regulations allow companies listed on the Stock Exchange or the Alternative Investment Market (but not private companies) to buy, hold and resell their shares. The regulations

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
apply only to â€˜qualifying sharesâ€™. These are shares listed on the London Stock Exchange or
traded on the AIM or listed on any other European Economic Area Stock Exchange.
Other main points to note are as follows:
â— The shares must be purchased from distributable profits since it was thought unlikely that
a company would wish to finance the purchase of shares to be held in treasury from the
proceeds of a fresh issue of share capital (s 724(1)(b)).
â— The company having bought shares to hold in treasury may cancel or sell them at any time
including a sale for a non-cash consideration.
â— Cancellation will involve a reduction of capital but there is no need for a special resolution
of the members or authorisation by the court.
â— Consideration received on a sale of treasury shares is to be treated as profits for distribution purposes.
â— The maximum number of treasury shares held at any one time must not exceed 10 per cent
of the nominal value of the issued share capital of the company. Where there is more than
one class of shares each class is subject to a separate 10 per cent limit. Shares held in breach
of the 10 per cent limit are subject to mandatory cancellation (ss 725(1) and (2)).
â— A company holding treasury shares must not exercise any voting rights attached to them
and if it does the votes are void. No dividend or other form of distribution can be made in
respect of them.
Disclosure of dealings in treasury shares
Dealings in treasury shares must be disclosed to the market under arrangements made with
the Financial Services Authority and the London Stock Exchange. The Listing Rules were
amended with effect from 1 December 2003 to take account of treasury shares. The rules state
that shares in treasury will remain listed so that new applications for listing are not required
when shares are sold out of treasury. However, to protect the market a company will normally
be prohibited from buying or selling treasury shares at a time when its directors would be prevented from dealing in the companyâ€™s shares under the Model Code of Directorsâ€™ Dealings
âž¨ See p. 258 (see Chapter 13 âž¨). A com pany is prohibited from buying or selling its treasury shares when
in possession of price-sensitive information as by insider dealing (see Chapter 13 âž¨). Treasury
shares may be included or excluded from a takeover offer and the prohibition on directors
dealing in share options will not extend to the purchase of options in treasury shares.
Company dealing in treasury shares: not regulated
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) (No 3)
Order 2003 (SI 2003/2822), as restated in Chapter 6 of Part 18 of the Companies Act 2006,
provides that purchasing its own shares to keep in treasury and the subsequent dealing in
those shares is not a regulated activity under FSMA 2000 so that the company does not
require FSA authorisation, at least for these activities.
Pre-emption rights
The pre-emption rights of existing shareholders on a new issue of shares apply to the sale of
shares held in treasury (s 560). These must therefore be offered first to existing shareholders
unless the procedures for disapplying pre-emption rights have been followed.

Financial assistance for the purchase of shares
The City Takeover Panel
So far as the Panel and the City Code are concerned the position is as follows:
â— Since treasury shares have few rights attached to them the provisions of the City Code and
the rules governing substantial acquisitions of shares will not apply to them.
â— A sale and transfer by the company of treasury shares will normally be treated like a new issue.
Financial assistance for the purchase of shares
Previous position
The prohibition on the giving by companies of financial assistance for the purchase of their
own shares or the shares of their holding companies by someone other than the company was
introduced by the Companies Act 1929 and retained in subsequent legislation until 1981.
The object was largely to defeat the asset stripper who might, for example, acquire shares
in a company by means of a loan from a third party so that he came to control it and once in
control could repay the loan from the companyâ€™s funds and then sell off its assets leaving the
company to go into liquidation with no assets to meet the claims of creditors. The company
concerned was usually one whose shares were, perhaps because of the management policies
of the board, undervalued.
The sanction of the law designed to deter this sort of activity was a default fine which could
be levied following criminal proceedings.
However, following cases such as Healdv Oâ€™Connor[1971] 2 All ER 1105, it was realised
that there were civil law consequences since the transactions surrounding the acquisition of
the company were illegal. Thus, the loan by the third party was void and irrecoverable at law;
if the company had given the lender a debenture to secure the loan, or a guarantee to repay
it, these securities were void and unenforceable, as was any guarantee or other security given
by anyone else including the asset stripper himself.
The same civil law consequences would apply in so far as a person infringed the present law
set out below. Breach of the present law is stated to be â€˜unlawfulâ€™ and is attended as before by
criminal sanctions, the maximum penalty being a term of imprisonment of two years and/or
a fine of unlimited amount.
Problems created by previous legislation
The rule against the giving of financial assistance struck potentially at ordinary commercial
transactions of companies as follows:
(a) Management buy-outs
This is the disposal of a company to its management. A holding company may use a buy-out
to sell off a subsidiary whose business though successful does not fit the current development
plan of the group.
However, the buy-out is more common in the case of private free-standing companies.
Suppose that in a family business senior management has reached the age of retirement and
is unable to find any purchaser of the business, who knows and can run it successfully other

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
than those employees who are coming up as the next generation of management. In such a
case those in management below the owner/directors may use a buy-out technique to acquire
the business with the blessing of the owner/directors (but see Bradyv Brady[1988] 2 All ER
617, below).
A management buy-out is commonly achieved by a bank lending the managers the money
to buy the shares. Typically the managers can only provide between 10 and 20 per cent of the
funds required. The loan is often secured on the assets of the company which management is
acquiring and this is the giving of financial assistance and was an infringement of previous
legislation.
Nevertheless, it was a popular and useful technique which regrettably operated outside the law.
(b) Other transactions
It was held by the Court of Appeal in Belmont Financev Williams(No 2)[1980] 1 All ER 393
that there was an infringement of then existing legislation when Company A bought the share
capital of Company B at an over-inflated price and the former owner of Company B used the
money to buy shares in Company A.
Belmont Finance was a member of the Williams group of companies and engaged in property development. The directors of Belmont were anxious to get the â€˜expertise and flair in
property developmentâ€™ of a Mr Grosscurth on the Belmont board, but he wanted to be a substantial shareholder in Belmont as well. Mr Grosscurth owned Maximum Finance which was
worth Â£60,000. Belmont agreed to buy Maximum Finance for Â£500,000 and Mr Grosscurth
used that money to buy a substantial stake in Belmont. In later proceedings this transaction,
which obviously reduced the net assets of Belmont, was regarded as unlawful financial assistance by Belmont.
Finally, there were even lawyers prepared to state that the purchase of shares in a company
by an innocent recipient of dividends from it might be infringing the financial assistance rule.
Thus, some not uncommon commercial transactions were rendered illegal by a rule which
was not, it seems, intended to catch all of them.
The Companies Ac t 2006
The Companies Act 2006 eventually did not implement a number of the Company Law
Review proposals to amend the rules relating to financial assistance as applicable to public
limited companies. As such, the law is only slightly amended to that found in the previous
Act. However, the main change that has taken place under the 2006 Act has been to take
private limited companies out of the scope of this rule as contained in ss 677-683.
The prohibition
Under s 678(1) of the Companies Act 2006, it is unlawful for a public company to give a person financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares or those of its holding company,
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of the acquisition before or at the same time as the
shares are acquired. Section 678(3) goes on to provide that where a person has acquired shares
in a company and a liability has been incurred for the purpose of the acquisition, it is not
lawful for that company to give financial assistance, directly or indirectly, for the purpose
of reducing or discharging the liability if, at the time the assistance is given, the company in
which the shares were acquired is a public company.

Financial assistance for the purchase of shares
There is no prohibition on a subsidiary company providing financial assistance for the
purchase of shares in its fellow subsidiaries or in a holding company providing assistance for
the purchase of shares in one of its subsidiaries. As we have seen, the prohibition is extended
to assistance after acquisition as where A borrows money to acquire shares in B Ltd and B Ltd
later repays the loan or reimburses A after A has repaid the loan. In this regard, the reference
to â€˜a personâ€™ is not confined to individuals but includes registered companies and other corporate bodies.
Section 683 goes on to provide definitions for the following terms outlined within the
chapter of the Act: â€˜distributable profitsâ€™; â€˜distributionâ€™; â€˜a person incurring liabilityâ€™; and
â€˜a company giving financial assistanceâ€™.
However, a considerable amount relating to the prohibition under s 678 relies upon the
definition of the term â€˜financial assistanceâ€™ as outlined in s 677 of the Companies Act 2006.
Meaning of financial assistance
Financial assistance is provided if the company concerned makes a gift of the shares or a gift
of funds to buy them; or guarantees a loan used to buy its shares; or gives an indemnity to the
lender; or secures the loan by giving a charge over its assets to the lender. A company would
also give assistance if it waived or released, for example, its right to recover a debt from a person A so that A could use the funds to buy shares in the company.
The 2006 Act also contains a â€˜sweep-upâ€™ provision contained in s 677(1)(d), which refers
to â€˜any other financial assistance given by a company where (i) the net assets of the company
are reduced to a material extent by the giving of the assistance; or (ii) the company has no net
assetsâ€™. In other words, this provides a â€˜catch-allâ€™ provision that may include anything not
specifically mentioned elsewhere within s 677(1). The test is not liquidity but net worth based
on the actual value of the assets. Thus, a purchase by a company for cash at market value of a
fixed asset from a person who later bought its shares would not be financial assistance because
the companyâ€™s net assets would not be reduced and cash would be replaced by the assets.
However, the section would catch artificial transactions affecting a companyâ€™s assets, as where
the company paid twice the market value for an asset in order to enable the seller to buy its shares.
Thus, as we have seen, in Belmontthe actual transaction was artificial and designed purely
to assist the owner of Company B to acquire shares in A at the expense of the assets of A,
because Company A paid far more for the shares of B than they were worth, i.e. Â£500,000
against a valuation of Â£60,000. The actual deal in Belmontwould thus infringe this, although
what happened is not otherwise a forbidden transaction.
â€˜Net assetsâ€™ is defined under s 677(2) as the aggregate assets less the aggregate liabilities
determined by reference to their actual rather than their book value. With respect to interpreting s 678, it is worth looking at the case of Bradyv Brady, 1988, where the House of Lords
held unanimously that the â€˜good faithâ€™ requirements had been complied with whilst the
purpose ones had not.
Bradyv Brady[1988] 2 All ER 617 HL
The first plaintiff and first defendant were brothers who carried on a family business through B Ltd.
They argued, and the first plaintiff petitioned under what is now s 994 of the Companies Act 2006
for an order to buy out the first defendant or for the company to be wound up. An agreement was
reached whereby one brother (Jack) would acquire the haulage side of the business and the other

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
(Bob) the drinks business, the assets being divided equally with B Ltd left in existence. The defendants then took the view that the assets had not been divided equally and refused to complete.
The plaintiffs sued for specific performance. At the trial, the defendants contended only that the
agreement had been illegal and ultra viressince it required B Ltd to dispose of its assets without
consideration, and that the proposed arrangements constituted the giving by B Ltd of financial
assistance in connection with the purchase of its own shares contrary to what is now s 678 of the
Companies Act 2006. The judge held that the principal purpose of the giving of financial assistance
was not to reduce or discharge any liability incurred by any person for the acquisition of shares,
but was incidental to the larger purpose of the arrangement and fell within the exception in s 153(2)
of the Act. He granted the order of specific performance.
Held - by the House of Lords - that the transfer of assets from B Ltd was intra viresand made in
good faith and so came within the scope of s 153(2)(b) of the Companies Act 1985 (now s 678(4)
of the 2006 Act). But the financial assistance had not been an incidental part of some larger purpose of the company within s 153(2)(a) and so prima facie it did not fall within the exception to the
prohibition of what is now s 678 of the Companies Act 2006 against a company giving financial
assistance for the acquisition of its own shares. However, there was a conclusive answer to the
agreement being rendered unlawful, whereby a private company could give financial assistance
for the acquisition of its own shares if the assets of the company providing the assistance were
not reduced by the provision of the assistance, or if the assistance was provided out of distributable profits. Since B Ltd could satisfy those provisions, a decree of specific performance
would be granted, subject to the defendants being given an opportunity to reinstate defences they
had abandoned.
(i) The House of Lords said that it was not enough to show that there were â€˜other reasonsâ€™ for the
assistance being given. Reasons were not the same as â€˜a larger purpose of the companyâ€™. In this
regard, Lord Oliver noted:
The ambit of the operation of the section is, however, far from easy to discern, for the word â€˜purposeâ€™
is capable of several different shades of meaning. This much is clear, that paragraph (a) is contemplating two alternative situations. The first envisages a principal and, by implication, a subsidiary purpose. The inquiry here is whether the assistance given was principally in order to relieve the purchaser
of shares in the company of his indebtedness resulting from the acquisition or whether it was principally for some other purpose - for instance, the acquisition from the purchaser of some asset which
the company requires for its business. That is the situation envisaged by Buckley LJ in the course of
his judgment in the Belmont Financecase as giving rise to doubts. That is not this case, for the purpose of the assistance here was simply and solely to reduce the indebtedness incurred by Motoreal
on issuing the loan stock. The alternative situation is where it is not suggested that the financial assistance was intended to achieve any other object than the reduction or discharge of the indebtedness
but where that result (i.e. the reduction or discharge) is merely incidental to some larger purpose of
the company. Those last three words are important. What has to be sought is some larger overall corporate purpose in which the resultant reduction or discharge is merely incidental.
(ii) Although the decision is not concerned with a management buy-out but rather a company
reconstruction, it could be said that a management buy-out is the â€˜reasonâ€™ for the assistance and
not â€˜a larger purpose of the companyâ€™.
As we have seen, it is necessary to find â€˜a larger purpose of the companyâ€™ of which the
giving of assistance is merely an incident. Clearly, if A sells an asset to B Ltd at the proper
market price and uses the money to buy shares in B Ltd, then the assistance is exempt because
B Ltd has â€˜a larger purposeâ€™ (i.e. the acquisition of the asset), but in the management buy-out
it may be a struggle to convince the court that there is a â€˜larger purpose of the companyâ€™.

Financial assistance for the purchase of shares
When is financial assistance lawful?
(1) The giving of financial assistance is lawful if the principal purpose of the companyâ€™s action
is not to give financial assistance OR such assistance is given as an incidental part of some
larger purpose of the company. In addition, the assistance MUST be given in good faith and
in the best interests of the company giving the assistance.
The companyâ€™s defence, therefore, is founded upon the purpose in giving assistance and
since this is a matter of fact to be decided on the evidence it would be as well for the purpose
to be set out clearly in the relevant board minutes. A purpose must be established other than
the mere giving of assistance and there is also a good faith and best interests of the company
requirement. This should prevent the kind of asset stripping referred to at the beginning of
this section although there is little doubt that some, seeking to gain profit from purely
artificial transactions at the expense of a companyâ€™s assets, will try to dress up their dealings
as some form, for example, of â€˜reconstructionâ€™.
However, a legitimate management buy-out is hopefully allowed and other ordinary
commercial transactions are no longer threatened by illegality. For example, A acquires B.
B wishes to transfer its bank balances to A to effect a more efficient disposition of funds
within the group. The boards of A and B may both know that A intends to use those balances
to reduce indebtedness, e.g. a loan incurred as a result of acquiring B, but this is permitted
because reduction of such indebtedness is merely incidental to a larger corporate purpose.
(2) The following are also permitted under s 681:
(a) A distribution of assets in Company A by way of dividend or in a winding-up where
the distribution is used to buy shares in A or in its holding company or in the case of
winding-up Aâ€™s former holding company (s 681(2)(a)).
(b) An allotment of bonus shares - which in a sense the company assists the shareholders
concerned to acquire (the provisions relating to assistance cover acquisition of shares
other than for cash but bonus shares are specifically exempt) (s 681(2)(b)).
(c) Any arrangement or compromise under s 110 and Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986,
which results, for example, in a liquidator transferring the assets of Company A to
Company B so that the shareholders of A receive shares in B into which A is merged
which in a sense Aâ€™s assets have assisted them to acquire (s 681(2)(f)).
(c) Where the funds used for the purchase of the shares in the company or its holding company arise from:
â— a reduction of its capital under Chapter 10 of Part 17 of the 2006 Act (s 681(2)(c)); or
â— a redemption or purchase of its shares under Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of Part 18 of the
2006 Act (s 681(2)(d)).
In the case where a company is reducing its share capital the money received by the shareholder in the reduction is most likely to be used to buy shares in the holding company.
(d) A company may lend money to a person which he uses to acquire shares in it or its holding company if lending money is part of the ordinary business of the company as is the
case with a bank (s 682(2)(a)). The fact that a company has power to lend money by its
memorandum does not make lending money part of its ordinary business unless making
loans is one of its main business activities. Neither the loans it ordinarily makes nor the
loan which facilitates the acquisition of the shares must be made for the specific purpose
of acquiring the shares. The borrower must be free to use the loan as he wishes, and it
must be merely coincidental that the borrower uses it to buy shares in the company.

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
So if a person gets a general loan or an overdraft from a bank and uses it or part of it to
buy shares in the bank, there is no illegal financial assistance.
(e) The provision by a company, in good faith in the interests of the company, of financial
assistance for the purposes of an employeesâ€™ share scheme is permitted (s 681(2)(b)). This
means that assistance is not limited to the provision of money for the acquisition of
shares but applies to all forms of assistance for the purposes of an employeesâ€™ share
scheme, e.g. repaying some or all of the borrowings taken out by the scheme in order to
buy the companyâ€™s shares. The giving of guarantees of loans to acquire the companyâ€™s
shares would also be included. A company may finance an employeesâ€™ share scheme
which benefits employees of the group and their dependants and not merely employees
of the company. Employee/directors may be included in such a scheme.
(f) A company may make loans to its employees, other than directors, to enable them to subscribe for or purchase fully paid shares in the company or its holding company to be held
by them in their own right (s 682(2)(d)).
It should be noted that the lending set out in points (d)-(f) above is permissible in the case
of a public company only if the companyâ€™s net assets are not thereby reduced, or, to the extent
that those assets are thereby reduced, if the financial assistance is provided out of profits
which are available for dividend. â€˜Net assetsâ€™ in relation to a company for this purpose means
the aggregate of that companyâ€™s assets less the aggregate of its liabilities, including provisions,
determined by their book value.
Finally, if shares are acquired by a nominee for a public company (not any other person)
with financial assistance from the company, then (apart from any infringement of the general
law) no voting rights may be exercised by that nominee and any purported exercise of such
rights is void. Secondly, the company must dispose of the shares within one year and if this
is not done it must cancel them. If the shares are cancelled and the cancellation has the
effect of reducing the companyâ€™s allotted share capital below the authorised minimum,
the directors must apply for the company to be re-registered as a private company. Only
a directorsâ€™ resolution is required to make the necessary reduction, application and any
alterations to the memorandum that are necessary. There is no need to apply to the court to
obtain confirmation of the reduction but any resolution passed by the directors must be filed
with the Registrar.
It is worth noting at this point that the 2006 Act does not prohibit a foreign subsidiary
from giving financial assistance for the acquisition of shares in its English parent company.
There is no need in such a case to follow the 1985 Act procedures. The authority for this is
Arab Bank plcv Mercantile Holdings Ltd[1994] 2 All ER 74.
Relaxation of restrictions: private companies
As noted at the beginning of this section, the Companies Act 2006 has removed the financial
assistance prohibition from private companies. Consequently, s 678 only applies to the provision of financial assistance being provided in relation to a public company.
Sanctions for breach of financial assistance rules
Under s 680, the consequences of a breach of the financial assistance rules are considerable,
as the following summary shows:

Financial assistance for the purchase of shares
â— It is a criminal offence. The company giving the assistance is liable to a fine and the officers
in default are liable to imprisonment and/or a fine.
â— The company and its officers can be sued and required to compensate any person who
suffers loss as a consequence of their unlawful actions.
â— Breach of the rules is a breach of fiduciary duty by a director for which the company can
claim damages.
Re Hill and Tyler Ltd (In Administration)[2004] EWHC 1261 (Ch)
This was an application by the administrators of a company for directions as to whether arrangements made in the course of the purchase of shares in the company by another company, and in
particular security given to the respondents as part of those arrangements, constituted unlawful
financial assistance by the company under s 151 of the Companies Act 1985 (now s 678 of the
Companies Act 2006); the issues included the validity of a statutory declaration by the companyâ€™s
director and, if it was invalid, the consequence of this on the security provided by the company to the
respondents and a loan made by the second respondent to the company. Richard Sheldon QC stated:
The argument can be broken down into three questions: (1) Is a contract involving the provision of
financial assistance in contravention of s 151, even where the whitewash procedure is available but
not properly complied with, void and unenforceable as a matter of statutory interpretation of s 151?
(2) If not, under the common law, is such a contract illegal as to its formation? (3) If not, is such a contract illegal as to its performance?
I consider first whether every contract which constitutes financial assistance within s 151 is rendered void and unenforceable as a matter of statutory interpretation. In Chitty on Contracts[29th edn,
2004, Sweet & Maxwell] the following is stated [citations omitted]:
Unenforceability by statute...arises where a statute itself on its true construction deprives one
or both of the parties of their civil remedies under the contract in addition to, or instead of, imposing a penalty on them. If the statute does so, it is irrelevant whether the parties meant to break the
law or not...Where the statute is silent as to the civil rights of the parties but penalises the making or performance of the contract, the courts consider whether the Act, on its true construction,
is intended to avoid contracts of the class to which the particular contract belongs or whether it
merely prohibits the doing of some particular act...It is important to note that where a contract
or its performance is implicated with a breach of statute this does not entail that the contact is
avoided. Where the Act does not expressly deprive the plaintiff of his civil remedies under the contract the appropriate question to ask is, whether, having regard to the Act and the evils against
which it was intended to guard and the circumstances in which the contract was made and to be
performed, it would in fact be against public policy to enforce it.
If, on the true construction of the statute, â€˜the contractbe rendered illegal, it can make no difference, in point of law, whether the statute which makes it so has in mind the protection of the
revenue or any other object. The sole question is whether the statute means to prohibit the contract.â€™ If, on the other hand the object of the statute is the protection of the public from possible
injury or fraud, or is the promotion of some object of public policy the inference is that contracts
made in contravention of its provisions are prohibited.
Applying these principles, and having regard to the mischief to which s 151 is directed, I consider
that contracts which are entered into in breach of s 151 are rendered illegal by that section. The section provides that it is â€˜not lawfulâ€™ for a company to give financial assistance directly or indirectly for
the purpose of the acquisition of its own shares. It seems to me to follow that contracts which are
entered into in contravention of that section are illegal. In consequence, such contracts are void and
unenforceable. Although the consequences on an innocent party may be harsh, it is well recognised
that the courts will not lend their assistance to transactions which are rendered unlawful by statute.

Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltdv Cradock (No 3)[1968] 1 WLR 1555
In 1957 a company, with an issued capital of Â£90,000, which carried on business as a rubber company in the Malay States was without a business, having sold its rubber estates, but had liquid
assets of about Â£235,800. B & T Ltd, acting for an undisclosed principal, C, made an offer for the
companyâ€™s stock. The offer was accepted by 79 per cent of the stockholders. The total amount
payable for the stock and expenses was Â£195,000.
The first transaction
It was arranged by C that the companyâ€™s account with a credit of Â£232,500 at N Bank should be
transferred to a new account at a branch of D Bank where C had an account with a very small
credit. At a meeting on 25 April 1958, two drafts for a total of Â£232,764 were received by D Bank
for the companyâ€™s new account. The companyâ€™s board resolved to lend 232,500 to W T Ltd at
8 per cent interest and a cheque for Â£232,500 was drawn on the companyâ€™s new account in favour
of W T Ltd; W T Ltd lent that amount at 9 per cent interest to C and the cheque was indorsed by
W T Ltd in favour of C and was paid into his account with D Bank, thus covering the payment of
Â£195,000 to B & T Ltd. The bank made no inquiries before paying that cheque. The 79 per cent
of the companyâ€™s stock was in due course registered in one of D Bankâ€™s nominee companies
as nominee for C. Both B & T Ltd and W T Ltd knew that Câ€™s purpose was to misapply the companyâ€™s moneys to finance the purchasing of its stock. By 25 April 1958, the companyâ€™s board
of directors had been reshuffled and L and J had been appointed. Later in 1958 L resigned. Both
L and J acted exactly as told by C and exercised no discretion or volition of their own. On
26 August 1958, the companyâ€™s account was transferred to N S Bank where it was opened with
a credit of about Â£700. The usual documents authorising directors to sign for the companyâ€™s
cheques drawn were sent.
The second transaction
On 26 January 1960, it was resolved at a meeting that the indebtedness of W T Ltd to the company
and the indebtedness of two nominee companies of C should be taken over, as to Â£207,500 by C
and as to Â£42,000 by H B Ltd; that a cheque for Â£207,500 in settlement of Câ€™s liability be paid into
the companyâ€™s account; and that bills for a total of Â£42,000 payable on future specified dates be
drawn on H B Ltd in settlement of its liability. There was a further reshuffle of the board of directors. J and one A. J resig ned, and B and S were appointed directors. At another meeting held
on either 26 January or on 27 January 1960, S was appointed chairman and B secretary. It was
resolved that the company should open an account with N S Bank, although it already had opened
an account with that bank. The usual banking resolution was passed and a mandate valid for the
opening of the account was signed by B and S authorising, inter alia, cheques drawn on the
account to be signed by the chairman and secretary or any two directors. A cheque for Â£207,500
was drawn for B from the companyâ€™s account in accordance with the mandate by S and B and B
drew a cheque for the same amount on his own account in favour of C. At an interview with an
official of the N S Bank in charge of the branch in the managerâ€™s absence it was explained that the
cheques were being exchanged for â€˜internal accounting reasonsâ€™ or â€˜internal book-keeping reasonsâ€™ and all three cheques were debited and credited as directed. On 19 February 1960, C sent
the company a cheque for Â£42,000 in place of the bills drawn on H B Ltd which had been refused.
That cheque was part of another series of three cheques and on 25 February 1960, they were
debited and credited to the three accounts in the same way as the three cheques for Â£207,500.
The purpose of the second transaction was to finance the purchase by B from C of the stock in
the company. S, though he knew the purpose, handed over the companyâ€™s cheque, without security, to B, but it was not intended that the money paid to the company by the cheques should
belong to it, the company serving a conduit pipe for the passage of that money.

Financial assistance for the purchase of shares
On 12 August 1964, following investigations by its inspectors, the Board of Trade issued a writ
in the name of the company pursuant to s 169(4) of the Companies Act 1948, claiming, inter alia,
a declaration that the defendants C, L, J, B and S, being directors, B & T Ltd and W T Ltd, being
other parties concerned with the transactions, and D Bank and N S Bank, being the companyâ€™s
bankers, were jointly and severally liable to replace moneys of the company which had been misapplied contrary to s 54 (1) of the Act of 1948. Ungoed-Thomas J noted:
...does the principle prevent an action succeeding for breach of trust in doing what is illegal?
In Steen v Law directors of a company, incorporated in New South Wales, lent the companyâ€™s
funds which the directors had to give financial assistance to purchase the companyâ€™s shares. The
liquidator of the company claimed that there had thus been a breach of a New South Wales section,
which, so far as material, was in the terms of s 54 of the Act of 1948; and that the directors had
thereby committed a breach of their fiduciary duty to the company and should reimburse the company the sums so illegally applied. It was not contended that the directors were absolved from
accounting by reason of the illegality of the loan by the company. Such illegality was clearly before
the Privy Council and, if available against such a claim, provided a complete answer to it. Yet the point
was neither taken by the defendants nor by the Privy Council; and it seems to me for the very good
reason that the company was not relying for its claim on the unlawful loan and the relationship of
creditor and debtor thereby created, but upon the misapplication by the directors of the companyâ€™s
moneys by way of the unlawful loan. That is the position with regard to the plaintiffâ€™s claim in our case.
It was founding its claim, as in our case, not on a wrong done by it as a party to the unlawful loan,
but as a wrong done to it by parties owing a fiduciary duty to it. The courts were being invited, as in
our case, not to aid illegality but to condemn it. If this were not so, the courts would give redress to
companies against directors for misapplication and breach of fiduciary duty which did not involve the
company in illegality, but no redress if they were so serious as to involve the company in illegality.
I appreciate that, in the ordinary case of a claim by a beneficiary against a trustee for an illegal
breach of trust, the beneficiary is not a party to the illegality; but that, when directors act for a company in an illegal transaction with a stranger, the company is itself a party to that transaction and
therefore to the illegality. The company, therefore, could not rely on that transaction as â€˜the source of
civil rightsâ€™ and, therefore, for example, it could not successfully sue the stranger with regard to rights
which it was claimed that the transaction conferred. If, however, property had passed under the illegal
transaction, it is common ground that the right which the holding of that property conferred would
be good against all the world, since the court would not assist the only party which had a better title,
namely the party from whom it passed under the illegal transaction, to recover it. The right of the
holder would be assisted by the courts, because it would be a right established by the holding, without having to rely on any right claimed to be conferred by the illegal transaction - and nonetheless
because it was in pursuance of the illegal transaction, to which the holder was a party, that the holding in fact arose: (see particularly Singhv Ali, and Chettiarv Chettiar). In a claim based on an illegal
breach of trust the claimant does not rely on a right conferred or created by that breach. On the very
contrary, he relies on a right breached by the breach, as the very words â€˜breach of trustâ€™ indicate. It
is only on the footing that there is a breach of trust that the defence of illegality becomes relevant. So
it is assumed, for present purposes, that there is a breach of trust against the plaintiff by those who
are directors and by those who are claimed to be constructive trustees. The constructive trustees are,
it is true, parties with the plaintiff company itself to the transaction which is illegal. The plaintiffâ€™s claim,
however, for breach of trust is not made by it as a party to that transaction, or in reliance on any right
which that transaction is alleged to confer, but against the directors and constructive trustees for perpetrating that transaction and making the plaintiff company party to it in breach of trust owing to the
plaintiff company. The breach of trust includes the making of the plaintiff a party to the illegal transaction. So it seems to me clear on analysis that the plaintiff is not precluded from relying on breach of
trust by a party to an illegal transaction to which the plaintiff itself is a party, when the breach includes
the making of the plaintiff a party to that very transaction. Those who proved to be constructive
trustees, sharing the responsibility with the directors for the breach of trust, share the liability too.

Chapter 8 Capital maintenance - generally
The result is that the plaintiff in this case would not, by reason of illegality, be prevented from being
reimbursed money paid by it unlawfully under a transaction to which it is a party. But this does not
mean that this would nullify the ordinary operation of illegality with regard to companies and parties
outside the company, and not being or treated as being a trustee to it. But it would prevent such
operation shielding those whose position or conduct makes them responsible as owing a fiduciary
duty or as constructive trustee.
Held - although an illegal transaction in a contract or consensual arrangement, itself being forbidden, could not give rise to civil rights a claim could be based on an illegal breach of a right; that,
therefore, as against the directors and constructive trustees, the company was not precluded from
relying on breach of trust by an illegal transaction to which the company was itself a party when
the breach included the making of the company a party to that very transaction; and that, accordingly, the fact that both the transactions in the present case were unlawful and avoided by s 54 of
the Act of 1948 did not defeat the companyâ€™s claims.
Management buy-outs and fair dealing by directors
Schemes of financial assistance given to directors to achieve a management buy-out would be
caught and rendered illegal by Part X of the 2006 Act - loans, etc. to directors. Thus financial
assistance for such a buy-out could only be given personally to management who were not at
the time at board level. However, if they later became directors, the outstanding loan would
not be illegal unless, for example, unpaid interest was added to the capital sum. However, if
the directors of, say, A Ltd, or some of them, wished to buy out the major shareholders of A
Ltd, a legal procedure would be for the acquiring directors to form another company, say B
Ltd, and borrow money from a bank in B Ltdâ€™s name, letting A Ltd give a security over its
assets to the bank to secure the loan to B Ltd of which the acquiring directors would form the
board. The loan would be used to buy the shares in A Ltd thus making it a wholly owned
subsidiary of B Ltd. Although A Ltd would have given financial assistance for the purchase of
its own shares, this would be within the law because the assistance would not be the â€˜principal purposeâ€™ but part of a management buy-out.
Financial assistance: auditorsâ€™ duty
In Coulthardv Neville Russell(A Firm)[1998] 1 BCLC 143, the Court of Appeal decided that
as a matter of principle auditors have a duty of care, not only to the company as client, but
also to its directors to advise them that a transaction which the company and its directors
intend to carry out might be a breach of the financial provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
It will be appreciated that the giving of unlawful financial assistance may affect the contracts
concerned with it at civil law and can result in criminal proceedings under which the company may be required to pay an unlimited fine, and its officers, if convicted, may receive
a custodial sentence of up to two years and/or an unlimited fine. Because auditors are often
asked to advise, and do advise, directors on the treatment of items in the accounts and
their likely attitude as auditors to particular future transactions, it may well be that the duty
to give advice on the statutory legal position could frequently arise. The decision seems
to widen the scope of potential liability of auditors for negligence. The allegations accepted
as a basis for a duty of care in this case seem to depend on an omission, i.e. the failure to
advise that a particular transaction which the directors tell the auditors they intend to do may
be illegal.

Capital maintenance -
company distributions

What is a distribution?
The matter of company distributions is a specific and rather special aspect of capital maintenance. The relevant rules are considered below together with the rules relating to the
declaration and payment of dividends.
Profits available for distribution - generally
In earlier times when the narrower term dividend was used rather than the current expression
distributions, it was said that â€˜dividends may not be paid out of capitalâ€™. This meant simply
that share capital which the company had received from its shareholders could not be used to
pay dividends to them. As we have said before, the creditors take the risk that the companyâ€™s
capital will be lost by business failure but they are protected by the law against it being paid
back to the shareholders. An alternative way of expressing the rule is that â€˜dividends may only
be paid out of profitsâ€™.
A continuing problem in protecting the creditorsâ€™ buffer in this area of company law has
been the identification of that portion of a companyâ€™s resources which can legitimately be
regarded as capital and, therefore, not distributable and that portion which can legitimately
be regarded as profit and consequently distributable.
The Companies Act 1980 made radical changes in regard to company distributions and
these rules, which are now to be found in Part 23 of the Companies Act 2006, are set out
What is a distribution?
According to s 829 of the Companies Act 2006, it is every description of distribution of
a companyâ€™s assets (not only a dividend) to members of the company, whether in cash or
otherwise, except distributions made by way of (a) an issue of shares as fully or partly paid
bonus shares; (b) the reduction of share capital: (i) by extinguishing or reducing the liability
of any of the members on any of the companyâ€™s shares in respect of share capital not paid up;
or (ii) by repaying paid-up share capital; (c) the redemption or purchase of any of the
companyâ€™s own shares out of capital (including the proceeds of any fresh issue of shares) or
out of unrealised profits in accordance with Chapters 3, 4 or 5 of Part 18 of the Companies
Act 2006; (d) a distribution of assets to members of the company on its winding up.
Thus, if Boxo Ltd, a television and video hire company, run by, say, five family shareholders, decided that instead of paying shareholders a cash dividend it would instead give
each shareholder free equipment, that would be a distribution and subject to the statutory
rules discussed below.
Since the provisions are concerned with payments of dividendpayments by way of deferred
remuneration to directors, even though there are no realised profits available, they are not
caught by the distribution rules (see MacPhersonv European Strategic Bureau Ltd[2000] 2
BCLC 683). However, such payments would be void and recoverable by the company if it was
insolvent. Then the creditorsâ€™ interests would be paramount.

Chapter 9 Capital maintenance - company distributions
Profits available - public and private companies
The basic rule outlined in s 830(2) of the Companies Act 2006 is that a companyâ€™s profits
available for distribution are: (a) its accumulated realised profits (both revenue and capital)
not previously distributed or capitalised (as by being applied in financing a bonus issue or the
purchase or redemption of the companyâ€™s shares with a transfer to a capital redemption reserve),
LESS (b) its accumulated realised losses (both revenue and capital) not written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital. It is also worth noting the wording of s 830(1) which states
that a company may only make a distribution out of profits available for the purpose.
From the above provisions it follows that:
1 Unrealised profits, either revenue or capital, are no longer distributable.
2 A realised capital loss following, for example, the actual sale of an asset at a loss will reduce
the profit available for distribution. The 2006 Act requires the making good of unrealised
capital losses following, for example, the downward revaluation of an asset retained by the
company, but only for public companies (see below).
The depreciation of fixed assets is required and realised losses to be taken into account
when calculating the sum available for dividend include amounts written off or retained
for depreciation. This ensures that dividends will be restricted to allow for depreciation,
subject to what is said below.
3 The use of the word â€˜accumulatedâ€™ is important. It means that the position in the current
year cannot be regarded in isolation. The profit and loss account is a continuous account.
Thus, if Boxo Ltd makes a trading loss of Â£1,000 in year 1 and Â£2,000 in year 2, but a trading profit of Â£1,000 in year 3, it must make a profit in excess of Â£2,000 in year 4 before any
dividend can be paid, unless the company applies to the court for a reduction of capital,
so cancelling the losses.
4 Undistributed profits of previous years cannot be brought forward and distributed without taking into account a revenue loss on the current yearâ€™s trading.
5 An unrealised capital profit cannot be applied in writing off a realised revenue loss.
The provisions also introduce other concepts which are set out below. Insofar as these
relate to realised profits reference should be made to the fourth Schedule which states, in
effect, that references in the Schedule to realised profits are to such profits as fall to be treated
as realised profits, in accordance with principles generally accepted with respect to the determination for accounting purposes of realised profits, at the time when the relevant accounts
are prepared.
This implies that it is for the accounting profession to specify in more detail the meaning
of realised profits and that the term may be amended from time to time so as to encompass
changes in accounting practice.
Restriction on distributions by public companies
Furthermore, with respect to public companies, s 831 of the Act states that a public company
may only make a distribution if the amount of its net assets (i.e. the aggregate of the companyâ€™s assets less the aggregate of its liabilities) is not less than the aggregate of its called-up
share capital and undistributable reserves, and if the distribution does not reduce the amount
of those assets to less than that aggregate. This means in effect that a plc must deduct any net

Figure 9.1 The capital maintenance rule
unrealised losses from net realised profits before making a distribution. A private company
need not do so.
Section 831(3) goes on to define the term â€˜liabilitiesâ€™ as including where the relevant
accounts are Companies Act accounts, provisions of a kind specified for the purposes of this
subsection by regulations under s 396; and where the relevant accounts are IAS accounts,
provisions of any kind.
Furthermore, s 832(4) defines the term â€˜undistributable reservesâ€™ as a companyâ€™s share premium account; capital redemption reserve; the amount by which its accumulated, unrealised
profits (so far as not previously utilised by capitalisation) exceed its accumulated, unrealised
losses (so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital duly
made); and any other reserve that the company is prohibited from distributing: (i) by any
enactment (other than one contained in this Part); or (ii) by its articles. Section 831(5) goes
on to provide that a public company must not include any uncalled share capital as an asset
in any accounts relevant for purposes of this section.
Although the above rule applies only to plcs, it should be noted that none of the reserves
listed above is distributable by private companies.
An illustration of the capital maintenance rule appears in Figure 9.1.
Realised profits and accounting standards
There are several possible meanings of the expression â€˜realisedâ€™ starting with the obvious
one of realised in cash. The conclusion reached following research by the accounting bodies
was that the preferable approach would be to treat an item as realised if its occurrence can
be established from sufficiently reliable measurements. The profit and loss account should be
confined to legally distributable profits. The treatment of individual items should follow the

Chapter 9 Capital maintenance - company distributions
guidance set out in the relevant Statements of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAPs) and, more
recently, Financial Reporting Standards (FRSs), issued by the Accounting Standards Board.
These are not considered further here because they are part of accounting rather than legal
practice and should be studied in the accounting context. As a legal point, however, it should
be noted that it was stated in Lloyd Cheyham & Co v Littlejohn & Co[1987] BCLC 303 that
â€˜SSAPs are very strong evidence as to what is the proper standard which should be adopted
and unless there is some justification a departure [...] will be regarded as constituting a
breach of dutyâ€™.
While the following of appropriate standards will continue to be a vital part of accountancy practice it will be possible for a court to find liability in negligence even though a relevant standard has been followed if the implication of a decision of the House of Lords in
Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority[1997] 4 All ER 771 is taken to its logical conclusion. The Law Lords qualified the long-established principle laid down in Bolam v Friern
Hospital Management Committee[1957] 2 All ER 118 that so long as medical practitioners
relied on â€˜a responsible body of professional opinionâ€™ they would not be liable in negligence.
The court was not bound, their Lordships said in Bolitho, to hold that a defendant doctor
would escape liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just because he leads evidence
from a number of medical experts who are generally of the opinion that the defendantâ€™s treatment or diagnosis accorded with sound medical practice. The court has to be satisfied that
the exponents of the body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such an opinion has
a logical basis.
Although the Bolitho case is a medical one, it is likely to be given general application.
It seems now that it will not necessarily be enough to meet an allegation of negligence with
the response that the actions complained of are accepted and practised by many others.
The court will wish to be satisfied that the practice stands up to logical scrutiny. Canadian
courts have already pronounced on the position regarding accountants: the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia in Kripps v Touche Ross(1992) 94 DLR (4th) 284 held against Touche
on the ground â€˜that the accountants had known that a simple application of [a Canadian
accounting standard] would omit material informationâ€™.
While Bolithois an important case, it is in practice unlikely that the courts will often find
that existing accounting standards are illogical, although they have now acquired the right to
do so in appropriate circumstances. The decision is perhaps not too surprising. Professional
persons cannot really expect to be judges in their own cause.
Related statutory rules
The relevant statutory provisions, running alongside accounting practice, are summarised below.
1 An unrealised profit cannot be applied in paying up debentures or any amounts outstanding on partly paid shares.
2 As we have seen, provisions for depreciation (and contingencies) are to be regarded as
realised losses when considering profits available for distribution. In addition, a deficit
on the revaluation of an asset gives rise to a provision which must be treated as a realised
loss except in two situations when the provision may be treated as an unrealised loss -
(a) where the deficit offsets an unrealised profit previously recorded on the same asset;

Related statutory rules
(b) where the deficit arises on a revaluation of all the fixed assets. This applies even though
goodwill is not revalued, notwithstanding that goodwill is treated by the formats of the
2006 Act, which deal with the way in which company accounts are to look, as a fixed asset.
The revaluation does not necessitate the changing of the amounts of every fixed asset,
but that every such asset be considered for revaluation by the directors. They must be
satisfied that those assets whose values have not been changed have an aggregate value not
less than their aggregate amount as stated in the financial statements.
The above will not apply unless the notes to the relevant accounts state:
(a) that the directors have considered the value at any time of any fixed assets of the company without actually revaluing those assets;
(b) that they are satisfied that the aggregate value of those assets at the time in question is,
or was, not less than the aggregate amount at which they are, or were for the time
being, stated in the companyâ€™s financial statements;
(c) that the relevant items affected are accordingly stated in the relevant accounts on the
basis that a revaluation of the companyâ€™s fixed assets which included the assets in question took place at that time.
It will be noted that the â€˜aggregateâ€™ approach enables losses on some assets to be compensated for by increases in the value of others.
3 Where a fixed asset is revalued upwards and subsequently depreciated, only that part of the
depreciation applicable to the value of the asset before its revaluation is treated as reducing realised profits. The excess may be added back to distributable profits.
The entries in accounting terms are set out in Figure 9.2.
4 Development costs, e.g. the costs of developing a saleable company product before any
revenue is received from its sale or use, must in general be treated as a realised loss. If they
are shown as an asset, i.e. capitalised, they are to be treated as a realised loss, except insofar
as the development costs represent an unrealised profit made on a revaluation of those
costs. The basic rule of realised loss does not apply either if the directors justify, in the light

Chapter 9 Capital maintenance - company distributions
of special circumstances, that the amount carried forward shall not be treated as a realised
loss. For example, the directors may feel that future benefits in terms of revenue from the
product can be reasonably anticipated in the near future and may wish to set off the expenditure on development against future revenue from its sale or use rather than treat it as a
realised loss in a particular year. The grounds of justification must be included in the notes
to the accounts on capitalised development costs as required by the fourth Schedule.
Special cases
Investment and insurance companies are subject to different rules contained in ss 832-835.
Basically, the 2006 Act gives an investment company (i.e. a public listed company whose business consists of investing its funds mainly in securities with the object of spreading investment
risk and giving its members the benefits of the management of its funds), an option when
making a distribution of using either the capital maintenance rule or an asset/liability ratio test
under which it can make a distribution but only out of its accumulated realisedrevenue profits less
accumulated revenue losses so long as this does not reduce the amount of its assets to less than
one and a half times the aggregate of its liabilities immediately after the proposed distribution.
An amount properly transferred to the profit and loss account of an insurance company
from a surplus on its long-term business, e.g. life assurance, shall be considered as realised
profit and available for distribution provided it is supported by actuarial investigation showing a surplus in the sense of assets over liabilities attributable to the long-term business.
Relevant accounts
The Companies Act 2006 requires companies to decide the question whether a distribution
can be made and the amount of it by reference to â€˜relevant accountsâ€™. The relevant accounts,
which must have been prepared to give a true and fair view, will most usually be the last
annual accounts. The accounts must have been laid before the company in general meeting,
âž¨ See p. 504 though a private company may elect to dispense with this requirement (see Chapter 23 âž¨).
In any case the accounts must have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act, or have been so prepared subject only to matters which are not material for
the purpose of determining the legality of a proposed distribution.
Audit considerations
The auditors of a company must have made an unqualified report on the accounts. If the
report is qualified, then the auditors must state in writing whether, in their opinion, the substance of the qualification is material for the purpose of determining the legality of the proposed distribution. A copy of any statement by the auditors relating to the qualification must
have been laid before the company in general meeting, or in the case of a private company,
which is not laying the accounts before a general meeting, circulated to the members.

Declaration and payment of dividends
In the case of a holding company, the latest annual accounts would normally be group
accounts and reported profit will have been determined by consolidation. If the consolidated
accounts are qualified, it may be necessary for the auditors to state whether or not the qualification is material to the calculation of distributable profits of the holding company. From a
legal point of view, the distributable profits are the realised profits of the holding company.
In Re Precision Dippings Ltd[1985] 3 WLR 812 it was held that compliance with these provisions was not a mere procedural matter.
In this case the company paid a dividend of Â£60,000 to its holding company. This payment
exhausted the subsidiary companyâ€™s cash resources, and some months later it went into voluntary liquidation. The liquidator sought recovery of the payment plus interest since it had
contravened the Companies Act and so was ultra vires.
For the year in question the auditorsâ€™ report contained a qualification as to the basis of
valuing work in progress. The auditors had not made the statement required by the 1985
Companies Act and the directors were unaware that it was required.
After the company had gone into liquidation, the auditors issued a statement that, in their
opinion, the basis of the valuation of work in progress referred to was not material for the
purpose of determining whether the dividend of Â£60,000 would have been in contravention
of the Act. This statement was subsequently accepted by a resolution of the shareholders.
The court held that the distribution rules are a major protection for creditors, and the
requirement for an auditorâ€™s written statement when the audit report is qualified is an important part of that protection. This statement has to be available before the distribution is made.
The payment of the dividend was ultra vires and the holding company held the Â£60,000 as
constructive trustee for the subsidiary.
The resolution of the shareholders could not ratify or confirm the dividend payment. The
shareholders could not dispense with or waive the legal requirements.
The above provisions regarding the functions of the auditor do not apply to companies
which have dispensed with the audit requirement. For these companies there is therefore no
audit or reporting requirement for the last accounts on distribution of profit.
Declaration and payment of dividends
There is no absolute right to a dividend. The question of declaration of dividends is usually
dealt with by the articles and the entitlements, as between shareholders, are determined by the
class rights attached to the shares. As noted in the case of Precision Dippings Ltdv Precision
Dippings Marketing Ltd[1986] Ch 447, the statutory procedure prescribed for the declaration of
a dividend is mandatory and a subsequent resolution of the shareholders cannot rectify matters.
Where the articles follow the pattern of Table A, the members can declare dividends by
ordinary or written resolution but cannot declare a dividend higher than that recommended
by the directors, and if the directors do not recommend payment of dividend, the members
cannot declare one either on the preference or ordinary shares. Under such a provision the
members in general meeting can reduce the dividend recommended by the directors. As
regards the dividend payable in a particular year, the matter is usually already decided because
the dividend has been paid before the general meeting is held. However, the members could
reduce the dividend recommended and paid which would involve adjustments in the accounts
for the following year.

Chapter 9 Capital maintenance - company distributions
The new model articles for both public (Art 69) and private companies (Art 30) limited by
shares require a recommendation from the board of directors for a dividend to be declared
together with approval from the shareholders. Once again, the shareholders cannot approve
a level of dividend above that recommended by the directors of the company.
Dividend payments have in the past been put to the members for approval at the annual
general meeting but where a private company has elected not to hold annual general meetings, approval to the payment of dividend can be sought from the members at any time to suit
the administrative convenience of the company in terms of the date on which a dividend payment is to be made but member approval by written resolution is required.
Table A provides that all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts
paid up on the shares. Under such an article, no amount credited as paid in respect of calls in
advance could be counted as paid for this purpose. Where the companyâ€™s articles exclude
Table A and yet do not provide for the method of payment of dividend, dividends are paid on
the nominal value of the shares.
A dividend must be paid in proportion to the shares held and at a uniform rate on all
shares of the same class. It is not possible, therefore, for the holders of a majority of the shares
to pass a resolution to the effect that a larger dividend (or a smaller one) shall be paid on their
shares than on those of other members.
Thus if a company has two shareholders, A and B, who hold 60 per cent and 40 per cent
respectively of the issued and paid-up ordinary share capital and they both agree that they
should be paid the same amount of dividend in regard to the last yearâ€™s accounts, this is
illegal unless the shareholdings are amended to a 50/50 proportion. Thus, a total dividend
of Â£20,000 cannot be split as to Â£10,000 each. The split must be Â£12,000/Â£8,000 unless the
shareholding is changed.
Unless the articles otherwise provide, dividends are payable in cash, but Table A provides
that the company may distribute specific assets in whole or in part satisfaction. Table A also
provides that payment may be made by cheque sent through the post to the registered address
of the holder. In the case of joint holders, it is sent to the one whose name appears first on the
register of members, or alternatively as the joint holders may direct in writing. Any one of two
or more joint holders may give an effectual receipt.
Table A further provides that no dividend shall bear interest against the company, unless
otherwise provided by the rights attached to the shares.
Dividends, when declared, are in the nature of a specialty debt and can be sued for up to
12 years from the date of declaration.
Interim dividends
When the directors can see that the company is going to make a sufficient profit by the end
of the financial year, they may declare a dividend part way through the year which is in the
nature of a part payment of the dividend for the year as a whole. At the end of the year a final
dividend is declared in respect of the balance. Table Aprovides that the directors may from
time to time pay to the members such interim dividends as appear to the directors to be
justified by the distributable profits of the company. Under Table Aan interim dividend does
not require the approval of a general meeting of the members, and is not in the nature of a
debt due from the company. Thus, if it is not paid, it cannot be sued for, and there is nothing
to prevent the directors subsequently rescinding or varying the dividend (Lagunas Nitrate Co
v Schroeder(1901) 85 LT 22).

Declaration and payment of dividends
Where the directors propose to pay an interim dividend, reference may have to be made to
interim accounts (s 836), which in the case of a public company must be such â€˜as are necessary to enable a reasonable judgment to be madeâ€™, i.e. accounts complying with the 2006 Act
(true and fair view) and signed by a director.
In this regard, s 838 states that interim accounts must be accounts that enable a reasonable judgment to be made as to the amounts of the items mentioned in s 836(1). Where
interim accounts are prepared for a proposed distribution by a public company, the following requirements apply. Section 838(3) provides that the accounts must have been properly
prepared, or have been so prepared subject to matters that are not material for determining
whether the distribution would contravene Part 23 of the 2006 Act.
In this respect, â€˜properly preparedâ€™ means prepared in accordance with ss 395 to 397
(requirements for company individual accounts), applying those requirements with such
modifications as are necessary because the accounts are prepared otherwise than in respect
of an accounting reference period (s 838(4)). Furthermore, s 838(5) states that the balance
sheet comprised in the accounts must have been signed in accordance with s 414. Finally, a
copy of the accounts must have been delivered to the registrar.
It is worth noting that the articles of a company normally provide for interim dividends to
be paid solely on the authority of the board of directors, rather than requiring the approval of
the shareholders in addition. This approach is replicated in the model articles under the 2006
Act in the form of Art 69 (public companies) and Art 30 (private companies).
Procedure for payment of dividend
The company may close its register for a short time before payment is made in order that the
register shall remain static while the procedure for payment is carried out. Dividend warrants
are prepared in favour of those persons whose names appear on the register, the dividend
being declared according to the recommendation of the directors. The warrants are posted to
the shareholders as soon as possible after the dividend is declared. However, companies
encourage the use of a dividend mandate system under which the payment is direct into the
shareholderâ€™s bank account.
In the case of share warrants, the company will advertise that the dividend is payable in exchange for a coupon bearing a certain number, these coupons being attached to the share warrant. A dividend warrant is then made out in the name of the present holder of the share warrant.
It is current practice not to close registers but to declare a dividend payable to shareholders registered as at close of business on a given date (the striking date). It should be noted
that companies are not concerned with equities when paying dividends. The registered shareholder (or the first named of joint holders) on the striking date or the first day on which the
register is closed is the person to whom the dividend is paid. If such a person has recently sold
his holding cum(with) dividend, the buyerâ€™s broker will claim it through the sellerâ€™s broker.
If the sale was ex (without) dividend, the seller keeps it and no claim arises. The purchase price
of the share will take into account the cumor ex dividend element.
Many companies include a power in their articles to forfeit unclaimed dividends after a
reasonable period. However, in the case of quoted companies Stock Exchange regulations
insist that such a power shall not be exercised until 12 years or more have passed since the
dividend was declared. Table A provides that any dividend which has remained unclaimed for
12 years from the date when it became due for payment shall, if the directors so resolve, be
forfeited and cease to remain owing by the company.

Chapter 9 Capital maintenance - company distributions
In the case of public listed companies, the requirements of the listing agreement as appearing in the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Services Authority, which deals with the listing of companies on the London Stock Exchange, would have to be considered. This specialist
âž¨ See p. 212 area is considered in outline in Chapter 10 âž¨.
Directors failing to declare dividends
It may well be that in a private company the directors are happy to take their salaries from
the company and refuse to declare dividends. Members who are not on the board may seek
advice as to the availability of remedies in this situation. Where the company has articles
similar to those of Table Anothing can be done under the constitution. Members who find
themselves in this situation are usually minority shareholders and so cannot change the
articles. Regulation 102 allows the members by ordinary resolution to declare dividends not
exceeding the amount recommended by the directors. So if the directorsâ€™ â€˜recommendationâ€™
is nil that is it.
However, a failure to pay a dividend may, in certain instances, amount to grounds for
the court ordering the winding-up of a company on the â€˜just and equitableâ€™ ground, if it has
pursued a restrictive dividend policy and prevented shareholders receiving a return on their
investments which they are reasonably entitled to expect (Re a Company (1988) 4 BCLC 506).
The court also indicated in Re Sam Weller & Sons Ltd [1990] Ch 682 that a restrictive
dividend policy may justify relief being granted by the courts under s 994 of the Companies
âž¨ See p. 312 Act 2006. Under s 994 (see Chapter 16 âž¨) a minority could ask the court for a declaration that they have been and are being unfairly prejudiced by the conduct of the board.
Any order made by the court would normally be a requirement for the majority or the
company to purchase the shares of the minority at a price to be determined usually by
the companyâ€™s auditors or advising accountants. The court is unlikely to declare and continue to declare dividends. As a minority such members would not have sufficient power
to remove the board and so s 994 is the only real way of getting out of the company with
their capital.
Consequences of unlawful distribution
Section 847(2) provides that if a member of a company knows or has reasonable grounds to
believe at the time a distribution was made to him that it contravened Part 23 of the 2006 Act
he is liable to repay it (or the illegal part) to the company. Section 847 does not deal with the
civil liability of the directors who made the improper distribution. However, since they have
misapplied the companyâ€™s property they are in breach of their fiduciary duty to the company
and therefore are jointly and severally liable to the company to replace the dividend paid. This
was decided in Flitcroftâ€™s Case(1882) 21 Ch D 519 and means that each director can be called
upon to repay the whole amount, and if he does he has a right of contribution against the
others. Thus, there are three directors - A, B and C. The dividend wrongly paid is Â£3,000.
A is called upon to pay and does. He may then recover by a claim at law if necessary Â£1,000
from B and Â£1,000 from C. Section 847(3) makes it clear that the liability of the members at
common law is preserved, and according to the decision in Moxham v Grant[1900] 1 QB 88
directors who have repaid the dividend to the company have a right of indemnity against each

shareholder concerned knew or not that it was paid out of capital.
It may be possible for the directors to claim relief if they have acted honestly and reason-

Allied Carpets Group plcv Nethercott[2001] BCC 81
In this case the High Court ruled that a former managing director who had received dividends that
he knew were paid on the basis of inadequate accounts held the dividends on a constructive trust
for the company and he was required to repay them to the company. The accounts deliberately
overstated both sales and profits by the inclusion of uncompleted transactions. The accounts
failed therefore to comply with ss 270 and 271 of the CA 1985 there being also no auditorâ€™s report
or statement as required by s 271 (s 837 of the CA 2006).
(i) In this connection, the High Court has also ruled that the directors of a plc who had authorised
the payment of dividends other than out of distributable profits were personally liable to repay
them to the company, regardless of whether they themselves were the recipients of the dividend
(see Bairstow vQueens Moat Houses plc, High Court [2000] 1 BCLC 549). The amounts were not
inconsiderable, being Â£27.7 million of dividend and Â£14 million in interest.
(ii) In the matter of Marini Ltd (liquidator of Marini Ltd)v Dickinson[2003] EWHC 334 (Ch) the High
Court was asked to excuse directors, who had paid dividends that exceeded available profits,
under s 727 CA 1985 because they had acted honestly and reasonably on accountantsâ€™ advice.
The court agreed that they had so acted but would not exercise its discretion to excuse because
the directors had themselves received the benefit of the dividend and could not be left with what
was a default benefit.
(iii) In Re Loquitur Ltd, IRC v Richmond [2003] STC 1394 the High Court ruled that the directors
of a company were liable to repay to the company certain dividends declared on the basis of
improperly prepared accounts which they had drawn up. The accounts did not make provision for
a potential corporation tax liability if a rollover relief scheme failed, which it did. The directorsâ€™ plea
to be excused because th ey had been assisted by what the court called â€˜a raft of advisersâ€™ in terms
of an appropriate scheme failed because they used an alternative scheme not referred back to the
advisers before declaring the dividend.
In the situation of an insolvent company, directors and shareholders may be required to
pay back certain dividends that have been made in contravention of s 630 of the Companies
Itâ€™s a Wrap (UK) Ltd (In Liquidation)v Gula[2006] BCLC 634
The appellant company (W) appealed against the decision ((2005) EWHC 2015 (Ch)) that the
respondents (G) were not liable to repay dividends which they had paid to themselves when the
company had had no profits out of which it could lawfully have paid the dividends. In the relevant
years W had made trading losses. Despite the fact that there were no profits out of which to pay
dividends, G, as the shareholders and directors of W, had caused W to pay them substantial dividends in contravention of the Companies Act 1985 s 263 (now s 630 CA 2006). W brought proceedings for return of the dividends relying on s 277(1) of the 1985 Act (now s 847 CA 2006) which
implemented the Second Council Directive 77/91 Art 16 and provided a statutory remedy against

Chapter 9 Capital maintenance - company distributions
a shareholder for recovery of an unlawful distribution paid to him if he knew or had reasonable
grounds to believe that it had been made in contravention of the Act. Gâ€™s case was that the
dividends described as such in the companyâ€™s accounts had been paid as salary and shown as
dividends as a tax efficient method of drawing the salaries, which was normal practice for small
businesses and had been done on the advice of an accountant. The judge held that s 277(1)
required G to know that they were contravening the Act when they paid the dividends and that
since they were ignorant of its provisions they were not liable to repay the dividends. G submitted
that a shareholder had to have knowledge of the requirement of the Act that the distribution
contravened.
Held- allowing the appeal - that s 277(1) had to be interpreted in accordance with Art 16 of the
Directive which provided that any distribution made contrary to Art 15 had to be returned by shareholders who received it if the company proved that the shareholders knew of the irregularity of the
distribution or could not have been unaware of it. A person was taken to know the content of
Community law as soon as it was published in the Official Journal, Friedrich Binder GmbH & Co
KG v Hauptzollamt Bad Reichenhall (161/88) [1989] ECR 2415 applied. Accordingly the right
approach to the interpretation of Art 16 was to proceed on the basis that when implemented the
general presumption that ignorance of the law was no defence would apply unless on the true
interpretation of the Directive it was excluded. On its true interpretation Art 16 meant that a shareholder was liable to return a distribution if he knew or could not have been unaware that it was paid
in circumstances which amounted to a contravention of the restrictions on distributions in the
Directive, whether or not he knew of those restrictions. The expression â€˜the irregularityâ€™ of the distributions referred to the fact that they had been made contrary to Art 15. It followed that all the
company had to show was that the shareholders knew the facts constituting the contravention.
In the instant case since G had been aware that the company had no profits they knew that the
distributions had been made in contravention of the Act for the purposes of s 277(1).
Capitalising profits
The company may, as an alternative to paying a cash dividend, capitalise its profits (see
s 853(3)). This may be achieved by the allotment of fully paid-up bonus shares (or scrip issue,
or capitalisation issue as it is sometimes called) by transferring to the capital account undistributed profit equal to the nominal value of the shares issued.
Profits, including unrealised profits, cannot be capitalised unless the articles so provide
because, as we have already seen, in the absence of such a provision a shareholder is entitled
to the payment of dividend in cash. Table A provides for the capitalisation of profits by an
ordinary resolution of the members in general meeting (or a written resolution) upon the
recommendation of the directors.
Where there is an allotment of bonus shares, the company must make a return of the allotment and since the shares are allotted for a consideration other than cash, the contract constituting the title of the allottees must be registered. Table A allows the directors to authorise
any person to enter into an agreement on behalf of the members who are to be allotted bonus
shares, and this would obviate the need to make a contract with them all.
The actual distribution of the bonus shares among the various classes of shareholders
will be based on their right to receive dividend unless the articles or terms of issue otherwise

Essay questions
A company is not in general bound to allocate certain of its profits to reserves, although it
must on a redemption or purchase of shares out of profits set up a capital redemption reserve,
and it may be that the company is bound under a contract with its debenture holders to set
aside a certain sum by way of a reserve to redeem the debentures.
Nevertheless, the articles may provide for the directors to set up reserve funds for dividend
equalisation or to meet future liabilities. Table A does not give such a power, it being implied
that provided the reserves are distributable the shareholders are entitled to them. However,
where such a power exists, the directors may decide to set aside all the profits, even if this
means that no dividend is paid on the preference or ordinary shares, though in such circumstances there may be a petition under s 994 by a member or members on the grounds of
âž¨ See p. 276 â€˜unfair prejudiceâ€™ (see Chapter 14 âž¨).

Question A
A dividend may not be paid by reference to a set of financial statements which carry a qualified
audit report unless the auditor states in writing that the matter is not material in determining
whether the proposed dividend is illegal under the Companies Act. Which of the following might
be considered material?
A A qualification disagreeing with certain reorganisation costs being classified as extraordinary.
B A qualification disagreeing with the carrying forward of goodwill arising on consolidation in the
consolidated balance sheet.
C A qualification for the non-disclosure of loans to directors.
D A qualification arising from a disagreement as to the book value of stocks.
Answer to question A
The answer is D since disagreement as to the book value of stocks will affect the amount of
realised profits in the profit and loss account.
A is a matter of classification, but the requirement for profits available for dividend is whether or
not they have been realised.

Aid to learning on distributions
B is a qualification affecting the consolidated accounts, but the write-off of goodwill on consolidation will not affect the distributable profits of the holding company.
C The auditors are required to disclose loans to directors if not included in the accounts or notes,
but this will not affect the distributable profits.
Question B
With reference to the following information, answer questions 1 to 6.
The table below shows the financial status of two companies, Alpha and Beta, at the year ending
31 March 20XX.
Alpha Beta
Unrealised revaluation surplus/(deficit) 350 (300)
Realised capital profits 250 150
Realised revenue profits brought forward 150 150
Realised revenue profits/(loss) for the year 50 (50)
At all times the net assets of the companies after distribution will exceed the statutory minimum.
1 If Alpha is a limited but not a public limited company, what are the profits available for distribution as dividend of Alpha Ltd?

Answers to question B
Q.1 The answeris C, Â£450 m.
A only takes account of the current yearâ€™s realised profits but it is accumulated realised
profits that are taken into account.

Chapter 9 Capital maintenance - company distributions
B excludes capital profits which are available if realised.
D includes revaluation surplus which is not available.
Q.2 The answer is C. There is no difference between a public and private company in such a case.
Q.3 The answer is B, i.e. realised revenue profits.
Q.4 The answer is D, Â£250 m. Realised losses must be taken into account but revaluation deficit
need not be so long as it relates to all the fixed assets (excluding goodwill).
Q.5 The answer is A. In a public company a further limitation is that the net assets must not be
reduced below the capital and non-distributable reserves.
Q.6 The answer is C, Â£100 m, since capital profits and losses need not be taken into account
provided the company qualifies as an investment company.

Company flotations

Chapter 10 Company flotations
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 made major and important changes in the
regulation of listing particulars and prospectuses as part of the new regime of investor
protection. Section and other references are to the Act of 2000 (FSMA) unless otherwise
indicated.
The official system for listing securities on
an investment exchange
Under s 72 the UK Listing Authority (UKLA) is part of the Markets and Exchanges division
of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) under the Director of Markets and Exchanges. This
merger took effect in November 2003. Its main task is to determine whether securities meet
the requirements to be admitted to and retained on the Official List of the relevant investment
exchange, the London Stock Exchange. Permission to actually trade the securities when they
have been admitted to the List is a matter for the London Stock Exchange.
The EC Transparency Directive (Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 15 December 2004) went into effect in the UK on 20 January 2007. The
EC Transparency Directive is wide-ranging dealing with areas such as notification of major
shareholdings, dissemination of information, new requirements on the content and timing
of financial information such as annual reports and half-yearly reports. Under the Companies
Act 2006, the FSA has been given the power to make rules for the purposes of implemented
the EC Transparency Directive. As part of this, the FSA has amended the Listing Rules
and updated the Disclosure Rules Sourcebook which is now known as the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules.
The new Listing Rules, Prospectus Rules and Disclosure and Transparency now make
up the Part VI Rules of the FSAâ€™s Handbook of Rulesreplacing the former UKLA Listing Rules
(the â€˜Purple Bookâ€™) which were substantially the same as the former London Stock Exchange
Listing Rules(the â€˜Yellow Bookâ€™). These were adopted when the FSA took over the function
of competent authority for listing from the London Stock Exchange in 2000. When the FSA
performs functions as the competent authority under Part VI of FSM, in that context the
name UKLA is used.
Applications for listing
The Listing Rules (LR) apply to issuers listed, or applying for listing, on the FSAâ€™s Official List
and to their sponsors. There is a two-tier listing regime: premium listings for equity shares
with super-equivalent standards; and standard listings for all other securities listed on an EU
directive minimum basis (LR 5). An issuer with a standard listing has fewer obligations under
the LR than an issuer with a premium listing. Issuers must comply with the rules that are
applicable to every security in the category of listing which applies to each security the issuer
has listed.
The application by a company must comply with the LR. However, an application may be
refused if granting it would be detrimental to the interests of investors (s 75). Of particular
importance is that, in the case of both premium and standard listing, 25 per cent of the
companyâ€™s shares must be in public hands and not, for example, in those of the directors

The official system for listing securities on an investment exchange
(LR 6.1.19R and LR 14.2.2R, respectively). In addition the expected market value of the
securities to be listed must be at least Â£700,000 in the case of shares and Â£200,000 in the case
of debt securities (LR 2.2.7R (1)). Securities of a lower value can be admitted to listing if
the relevant authority is satisfied that adequate marketability can be expected (LR 2.2.8G).
The Treasury, which has regulatory powers in the field of financial services, has, for example,
designated private companies as being unlistable.
Decision on the application
The FSA has six months to consider an application. Where listing is granted, the applicant
must be given written notice. If the FSA refuses the application, there are rejection procedures
that the FSA must follow, including the right of the applicant to appeal to the Financial
Services and Markets Tribunal set up under Part IX of the FSMA (ss 75 and 76).
Discontinuance and suspension of listing
The FSA has discretion to suspend a listing for a while or discontinue it altogether where it is
satisfied that there are special circumstances that preclude normal dealing in the shares, as
where there appears to be insider dealing in them on the basis of inside information, e.g. a bid
for the company not known to the public. The FSA will often need to act quickly and so need
not use its rejection procedures, but if it refuses to cancel its decision to suspend a listing,
it will have to follow rejection procedures. In any case, the holders of the securities cannot
challenge the decisions of the FSA by judicial review through the courts (see ss 77 and 78 and
R v International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, ex parte
Else (1982) Ltd[1993] BCC 11).
Listing particulars and other documents
Prospectuses and listing particulars must be approved by the FSA. Publication and advertising before the shares can actually be listed is covered in the Prospectus Rules. The requirements for publication of a prospectus are set out in the Prospectus Rules. The requirement to
file a copy of a prospectus or listing particulars with the Registrar of Companies however is
no longer applicable (s 83 repealed by Prospectus Regulations 2005/1433, Sch 1, para 4).
General duty of disclosure in listing particulars
In addition to detailed information required by the Listing Rules and any special conditions
imposed by the FSA that are beyond the scope of this text, listing particulars must contain all
such information as investors and their professional advisers would reasonably require and
reasonably expect to find there for the purpose of making an informed assessment of:
â— the assets and liabilities, financial position, profits and losses and prospects of the issuer of
the securities; and
â— the rights attaching to the securities (s 80(1) and (2)).
Once a class of securities has been issued, further issues still require new listing particulars
unless it is, for example, a bonus issue.

Chapter 10 Company flotations
Supplementary listing particulars
Those responsible for the original particulars are under a duty to notify any change or new
matter of which they become aware (s 81). Supplementary particulars must be submitted by
the issuer for approval and then filed with the Registrar of Companies and published.
Those responsible are defined by the Treasury in statutory instruments (s 79(3)). They
include the issuer or sponsor, such as a merchant (or investment) bank and, of course, the
directors of the issuing company.
Default sanctions
The FSA can publicly censure (name and shame) or fine anyone who was a director at the
time and was knowingly concerned in the contravention of the Listing Rules. Sponsors such
as investment banks may be censured but not fined (ss 89 and 91). In imposing a public reprimand or fine, the FSA must follow its disciplinary procedures (ss 89 and 92-94). Offering
securities to the public before a prospectus is issued is an offence punishable by up to two
yearsâ€™ imprisonment as well as a fine (s 85(1)-(3)).
The FSA can launch an investigationinto suspected contravention of the rules (s 97) and
institute legal proceedings on behalf of investors for compensation and/or disgorgement of
profits for breach of any obligation under the FSMA 2000 and can order an authorised firm
to make payment without taking court action (ss 382 and 383).
So far as investors are concerned, there is a separate civil action for them against anyone
responsible for misleading listing particulars and prospectuses (see below).
Prospectuses
When will a prospectus, as distinct from listing particulars, be used to make an issue of shares?
Generally, a prospectus must be produced when securities are being issued to the public while
the company is still seeking a listing, provided the shares are being offered for the first time.
More specifically in order to evaluate the need for a prospectus in conjunction with any issue
or offering of shares, one must consider:
1 whether the securities are of a kind to which the Prospectus Rules apply (Sch 11A); or
2 whether the securities are of a kind being offered in circumstances falling within the
s 86(1) private placement exemption for which Prospectus Rules 1.2.2 R offers exemption;
3 whether the Prospectus Rules 1.2.3 R exemption in relation to admissions to trading apply;
4 whether an application for admission to trading is being made.
If so, a prospectus will be required unless one of the exemptions described above applies
(ss 85 and 86).
The FSA requires all applicants for listing to use the services of a sponsor, e.g. an FSAauthorised investment bank, to ensure that the applicant company complies with all its
obligations. The FSA may refuse an application to be an approved sponsor (s 88). Sponsors

The official system for listing securities on an investment exchange
may be censured by the FSA but not fined for breaching any rules on listing imposed on
them (s 89).
Compensation for false or misleading statements
Errors in listing particulars and prospectuses make any person responsible for the relevant
document liable for any loss caused thereby to anyone acquiring the securities that the document covers (s 90).
Errors include:
â— untrue or misleading statements in the document;
â— the omission of any matter requiring inclusion by the Listing Rules, except:
(a) a case where there is no such matter; or
(b) an omission that has been authorised by the FSA.
The fact that matter required by the Listing Rules is omitted is to be taken as a statement that
there is no such matter (ss 82 and 90(3)).
Statutory defences
A person responsible (see below) can avoid liability where he made such enquiries as were
reasonable and reasonably believed that the statement was true and not misleading (or properly omitted) when the document was submitted for approval by the FSA, provided that
when the securities were later acquired:
â— he continued in that belief;
â— it was not reasonably practicable to bring the correction to the attention of those likely to
acquire the securities;
â— he had taken all reasonable steps to bring a correction to their attention; or
â— he ought reasonably to be excused because he believed it when the dealings began and now
too much time has elapsed (Sch 10, para 1).
There is also a defence where, although no correction was made, the person responsible did
not reasonably believe the matter was material and where he reasonably believed a correction
had been published. Furthermore, no one is liable to a person who acquired the securities
knowing of the error (Sch 10, paras 3, 6 and 7).
Statements by experts
If the statement is made by or on the authority of an expert, such as an accountant, valuer or
engineer, and is included with his consent, other persons responsible for the document have
only to prove that they reasonably believed that the expert was competent and had consented.
There is no need to show that there was reasonable belief in their truth. A correction need
only be to the effect that the expert was not competent or had not consented. There is no
liability for statements by public officials or in official documents, provided that they have
been fairly and accurately reproduced (Sch 10, paras 2, 4, 5 and 8).
The duty to report significant changes continues until dealings begin and after that there is
a duty to make reasonable endeavours to issue a correction notice unless, given lapse of time,
the document is no longer relevant (ss 80, 81, 90 and Sch 10).

Chapter 10 Company flotations
Dealings in the after-market
Acquiring securities includes contracting to acquire them or any interest in them not merely
at the time of listing but seemingly also in secondary dealings after issue called the aftermarket (s 90(7)).
Persons responsible
Under s 79(3) the Treasury defines by statutory instrument those responsible for listing particulars and prospectuses. Currently it is the following:
â— the issuer of the securities, e.g. the sponsoring investment bank;
â— the directors and proposed directors of the issuing company;
â— consenting experts for their own part of the particulars or prospectus.
Common law claims
These are expressly preserved by s 90(6). The position is as follows:
â— The normal contractual remedies for breach of contract or misrepresentation apply, including rescission of the contract (but see below). These remedies are against the company.
â— Actions against directors, auditors or sponsors will have to be based on the tort of deceit
or the tort of negligence since there is no contractual nexus with these persons.
It is not easy to prove deceit since some form of dishonesty must be shown. The burden of
proof in negligence is on the claimant but is not so difficult to prove. However, the defendant
will only be liable if a duty of care exists and is broken and the loss was within the contemplation of the defendant. The general rule of foreseeable loss is probably too wide for this type
of case. The relevant case law appears below.
(a) Fraud claims
Derryv Peek(1889) 14 App Cas 337
The Plymouth, Devonport and District Tramways Co had power under a special Act of Parliament
to run trams by animal power and, with the consent of the Board of Trade, by mechanical and
steam power. Derry and the other directors of the company issued a prospectus inviting the
public to apply for shares in the company and stating that the company had power to run trams
by steam power and claiming that considerable economies would result. The directors assumed
that the Board of Trade would grant its consent as a matter of course, but in the event the
Board refused permission for certain parts of the tramway, and the company went into liquidation.
Peek, who had subscribed for shares under the prospectus, brought this action against the directors for fraud.
Held- by the House of Lords - that before a statement can be regarded as fraudulent at common
law, it must be shown that it was made knowing it to be untrue, or not believing it to be true,
or recklessly, not caring whether it be true or false. On the facts of the case, it appeared that the
directors honestly believed that permission to run the trams by steam power would be granted as
a matter of course by the Board of Trade, and thus they were not liable for fraud.

Offers of unlisted securities
Fraud must be proved to the criminal standard, i.e. beyond a reasonable doubt; not to the civil
standard, i.e. on a balance of probabilities. It is thus not easy to sustain an action based on fraud.
Furthermore, it will be noticed from this case that the mere fact that no grounds exist for believing
a false statement does not of itself constitute fraud. Dishonesty is required.
(b) Negligence claims
As regards claims in negligence by those who have purchased in the market, it appears that
there is no duty of care on the part of the makers of false statements in listing particulars
to those who make market purchases, though there is a duty to subscribers direct from
the company. This follows from the restrictive approach to liability in negligence by the
âž¨ See p. 504 House of Lords in Caparo Industries v Dickman, 1990 (see Chapter 23 âž¨). This restrictive
approach was applied by Mervyn Davies J in the High Court in Al-Nakib Investments
(Jersey)Ltd v Longcroft[1990] 3 All ER 321. The claimant company sued the directors of a
company, claiming that it had bought shares in the company under an allegedly false prospectus. This it was said had induced the purchase of 400,000 shares in the newly floated
company under the prospectus and directly from the company and had also induced the
purchase of other shares in the company on the stock market. The judge held that since
the purpose of the prospectus was to invite subscriptions direct to the company and not
purchases through the stock market there was no duty of care in negligence in regard to the
market purchases, though there was a duty in regard to the shares purchased directly from
the company.
There has been some movement in the position at common law since Possfund Custodian
Trustee Ltd vVictor Derek Diamond[1996] 1 WLR 1351. Mr Justice Lightman in the High
Court stated that nowadays it is at least arguable that those who are responsible for issuing
listing particulars and prospectuses owe a duty of care to subscribers and those who purchase
in what may be described as the after-market in reliance on the prospectus. This could place
liability on the companyâ€™s directors and its advisers if they are negligent.
Purchasers in the after-market following an issue with a listing are protected by s 90(7)
in terms of statutory remedies. The only advantage of claiming at common law under
Possfund is that not all of the FSMA 2000 statutory defences are available to the defendant
(see above). The only defence at common law is a reasonable belief in the truth of the
statement.
Offers of unlisted securities
In previous editions we have discussed offers on the Unlisted Securities Market, which has
been replaced by the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). These securities are not part of
the FSMA 2000. The Prospectus Regulations 2005/1433 repeal the Public Offers of Securities
Regulations 1995 which have governed public offers of unlisted securities in both unquoted
and AIM companies for some 10 years. The contents of prospectuses issued by any companies
in the UK (whether they be listed, AIM, Ofex or unquoted companies) are now governed by
the Prospectus Regulations.

Chapter 10 Company flotations
The remedy of rescission
The main remedy for loss resulting from a misstatement in listing particulars is, as we have seen,
damages based either on breach of a statutory duty under the FSMA and the Misrepresentation
Act 1967, or at common law under the principles of liability for negligent misstatements.
The remedy of rescission involves taking the name of the shareholder off the register of
members and returning money paid to the company by him. This is against the modern trend
because it goes contrary to the principle of protection of the creditorsâ€™ buffer which is the
major purpose of the many statutory rules relating to capital maintenance.
The modern trend is to leave the shareholderâ€™s capital in the company but allow him a
remedy for money compensation if the shares are less valuable because of the misstatement
and against those who were responsible for the misstatement, such as directors or experts.
The cases which are illustrative of the remedy of rescission are rather old and are not
referred to here. Suffice it to say that in order to obtain rescission, the shareholder must prove
a material misstatement of fact not opinion (the principles in negligence cover actions for
damages for opinions), and that the misstatement induced the subscription for the shares.
The action can only be brought by the subscriber for the shares under the prospectus.
The right to rescind is a fragile one, being lost unless the action is brought quickly; or if the
contract is affirmed, as where the shareholder has attended a meeting and voted the shares; or
where the company is in liquidation or liquidation is imminent.
Procedures for issuing shares
As we shall see in Chapter 11, shareholders in companies today have pre-emption rights,
i.e. a right to have new issues offered to them first (s 561, CA 2006). A company that is
proposing to allot equity securities (defined in s 560, CA 2006) must offer them to existing
shareholders first (that is, on a pre-emptive basis). In essence, a shareholder should be able
to protect his proportion of the total equity of a company by having the opportunity to subscribe for any issue of equity securities. This is subject to various exceptions categorised in
s 561(a)(5), CA 2006. The company can disapply this right by special resolution (or in the case
of private companies by the articles). Listed companies usually propose resolutions to disapply statutory pre-emption rights at each annual general meeting under CA 2006 ss 570 and
571. Listed companies must also comply with pre-emption rules contained in LR 9.3.11R and
LR 9.3.12R.
However, in the case of listed companies, since the major shareholders of listed companies
are institutions, such as insurance companies, which like to receive offers of new shares, listed
companies are in general restricted to a disapplication of only up to 5 per cent of the existing
shares. Therefore, rights issues to existing shareholders are the major way of financing listed
companies in capital terms and not offers directly to the public. The circular that accompanies the rights issue to shareholders is a prospectus and must be approved by the FSA. The
circular must contain the detailed requirements set out in the Listing Rules (LR 13.8.2R). The
shares are allotted to the shareholders under provisional allotment letters and these can
be traded in the market nil paid while the rights offer is open for acceptance. Thus the shareholder can sell his rights without paying the company for them. The purchaser from the

Underwriting
shareholder will pay the market price to the shareholder and since rights issues are at a discount to the market value, but not, of course, less than par value, the shareholder will make a
profit and will be left with money when he has later paid the company the discounted price.
Any shares remaining, as where a shareholder does nothing, will be placedby the companyâ€™s
brokers with their clients and any not so taken up will be left with the merchant or investment
bank that has underwritten the issue or any sub-underwriters. These are then the two main
methods these days of raising equity finance by listed companies. A placing will be on the
terms of the rights issue particulars but will not even require those, in full form at least, if the
offer is to no more than 50 persons or to professional investors.
Underwriting
Before a companyâ€™s shares or debentures are issued, agreement is reached with an investment
bank that is prepared for a commission to take up (or underwrite) the whole or a part of the
shares being offered if not all of the shares are taken up. Under the LR, the underwriting
agreement is a material contract. Moreover, where the circular is a prospectus the underwriting agreement must be included into the circular through a summary of its material
It is usual to underwrite even when a company is sound and the shares are popular, since
changes, for example in the international situation or the financial state of the country, can
affect an issue adversely.
Due to the fact that the payment of underwriting commission could be used as a device to
issue shares at a discount, the payment of underwriting commission is controlled by s 553(2)
of the CA 2006. Section 553 of the CA 2006 provides that a company may pay a commission
to a person in consideration of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe (whether absolutely
or conditionally) for shares in the company, or procuring or agreeing to procure subscriptions (whether absolute or conditional) for shares in the company if: (a) the payment of
the commission is authorised by the companyâ€™s articles; and (b) the commission paid or
agreed to be paid does not exceed (i) 10 per cent of the price at which the shares are issued;
or (ii) the amount or rate authorised by the articles, whichever is the less.
If there is in existence a share premium account, this may be applied to pay the commission
on an issue of shares or debentures (s 610, CA 2006).
Terms of the agreement
The underwriter agrees to underwrite a stated number of shares on the terms of a specified
prospectus or particulars so that an alteration in these documents before issue may render the
underwriting agreement void if it materially increases the risk taken by the underwriters.
Thus, in Warner International & Overseas Engineering Co Ltdv Kilburn, Brown & Co(1914)
84 LJ KB 365 a company altered the draft prospectus on which an underwriting agreement
was based by reducing the minimum subscription to be received before allotment from
Â£15,000 to Â£100 and by stating also that, instead of buying a business it was to acquire by
one payment from the proceeds of the issue, it would buy the business by instalments out of
future issues. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the underwriters were released from
their contract.

Chapter 10 Company flotations
The underwriter agrees to take up the balance of shares (if any) not taken up in the issue,
and authorises a director or other agent of the company to apply for the shares on the underwriterâ€™s behalf. This means that the company can ensure the allotment of the shares to the
underwriter, and thus have an action for the full price, and not merely an action for damages
if the underwriter merely refuses to apply for them. The authority to apply is expressed to
be irrevocable.
Finally, the company agrees to pay a certain percentage of the nominal value of the underwritten shares as commission. The amount of the commission is a matter between the parties
and the UKLA, but it must be in line with the risk and not excessive in terms of it if listing is
to be obtained.
The liability of the underwriter ends when persons subscribe for the shares, and he cannot
be called on to pay if allottees do not meet their liabilities.
Sub-underwriting
Underwriters may enter into sub-underwriting contracts to relieve themselves of the whole or
part of their liability. The underwriter pays a commission to the sub-underwriters.
This is a commission paid over to a bank, stockbroker, or issuing house for placing shares.
The difference between brokerage and underwriting is that the broker does not agree to take
the shares himself, but merely agrees to try to find purchasers. The payment of brokerage
could also lead to an issue of shares at a discount and yet it is not controlled by the CA 2006,
s 552(3), providing that s 553 shall not affect the power of any company to pay brokerage.
However, it can only be paid to a bank, market maker, or issuing house and the rate must be
reasonable, though the precise rate is a matter for negotiation according to the degree of risk
(Metropolitan Coal Consu mersâ€™ Association v Scrimgeour[1895] 2 QB 604).
The Prospectus Directive: EU developments
This background note is included mainly because of the effect that the EU Prospectus
Directive has had on the position of the AIM. As already noted this is a market that has proven
quite attractive to the smaller plc wishing to trade its shares on a public market perhaps on
conversion from a private company.
The Prospectus Directive came into force on 31 December 2003. Member states were
required to implement the new regime by 1 July 2005. On 1 July 2005, the Prospectus
Directive was implemented in the UK. In addition to changes to the FSMA and to the Listing
Rules of the FSA necessitated by these directives, the FSA introduced further changes to the
listing regime.

The main principle
This is that if an issuer is making an offer of securities to the public or its securities are being
admitted to trading on a regulated market in the EU it must publish a prospectus and get it
approved by the competent authority in what is called its â€˜home member stateâ€™. When the
prospectus has been approved in that state it may then be used to offer shares or gain admission to regulated markets in all EU member states without the issuer having to publish any
further information or having to get further approval for the document in those member
states. The Directive sets out the procedure for identifying an issuerâ€™s home member state and
states when a prospectus is required and what it should contain. The Directive relates only to
the prospectus and does not govern admission criteria and continuing obligations. The UK
and other member states will be able to impose additional obligations in those areas but cannot impose any additional disclosure requirements so far as the prospectus is concerned.
Home member state for EU issuers
The home member state for an EU issuer will be the member state in which it has its registered office.
A German company decides to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange. It is not offering shares in Germany or seeking admission of the shares to a regulated market in Germany.
Its home member state will be Germany and so the German competent authority will approve
the prospectus. The competent authority in England will then have to accept that prospectus
as approved and will not be able to require the issuer to publish any additional information.
It will have discretion to assess whether the issuer satisfies any eligibility criteria for admission
to listing or trading set by it.
The effect on the AIM
The Directive covers secondary markets such as the AIM and in fact one of the European
Commissionâ€™s objects is to catch start-up and high-tech companies and apply more onerous
requirements to them. This could have affected the AIM, however, the London Stock
Exchange made the AIM an unregulated market from 12 October 2004 in order to avoid the
application of the Directive.
Non-EU issuers
These issuers have also been affected by the Prospectus Directive. In regard to non-EU issuers
whose securities are already admitted to trading on an EU regulated market the issuer has to
choose as its home member state the member state where its securities are first offered to the
public or where its securities are first admitted to trading in the EU after the Directive comes
into force, i.e. after 31 December 2003. The issuer had to notify its decision to the competent
authority of its chosen member state by 31 December 2005.
For non-EU issuers whose securities are not already admitted to a regulated market in the
EU the home member state will be the member state where the securities are offered to the
public or admitted to trading in the EU for the first time (this is at the choice of the issuer
whether or not the issuer has to publish a prospectus) after the date of entry into force of the
Directive, i.e. 31 December 2003.

Chapter 10 Company flotations
FSA Listing Rules review
The FSA has reviewed the UK Listing Rules resulting in an overhaul of the listing regime
on the London Stock Exchange. This review was to some extent driven by the Prospectus
Directive and the result has been the issuance of the FSA Handbook containing the Disclosure
Rules, Listing Rules and the Prospectus Rules. As a result of that review, the FSA has made a
number of changes to the listing regime that have come into effect.
The two-tier listing regime still stays; however, the two branches are now called â€˜premiumâ€™
and â€˜standardâ€™. Premium listing issuers must meet â€˜super-equivalentâ€™ standards (which also
existed previously). These are standards imposed by the FSA that go beyond relevant EU
directive standards. Those issuers who have securities that do not meet premium listing
standards will have to undertake standard listing. A standard listing involves the EU directive
minimum standards (just as it did before). One of the major reform goals which the new
requirements attempt to promote is increased harmonisation of obligations within a listing
segment regardless of whether the issuer is incorporated in the UK or overseas.

Shares - generally

Chapter 11 Shares - generally
Section 540 of the CA 2006 defines the term â€˜sharesâ€™. Section 540(1) of the CA 2006
identifies that the term â€˜shareâ€™, in relation to a company, means share in the companyâ€™s
share capital. A companyâ€™s shares may no longer be converted into stock (CA 2006, s 540(2)).
Section 540(3) of the CA 2006 provides that stock created before the commencement of Part
17 of the CA 2006 may be reconverted into shares. The procedure for this is set forth in s 620,
CA 2006. CA 2006, s 540(4)(a) provides that in the Companies Acts references to shares
include stock, except where a distinction between share and stock is express or implied. CA
2006, s 540(4)(b), provides that where references to a number of shares include an amount
of stock where the context admits the reference to shares shall be read as including stock.
References to â€˜sharesâ€™ in the Companies Act 1985 and 2006 includes stock. However, now
under s 540(2) of the CA 2006 it is no longer possible for a company that has stock at the date
this provision came into force (1 October 2009) to reconvert its stock back into shares (s 620,
Prior to passage of the Companies Act 2006, CA 1985, s 14 provided that the memorandum and articles when registered bind the company and its members to the same extent as if
they respectively were signed and sealed by each member and contained covenants on the part
of each member to observe all the provisions of the memorandum and of the articles. Under
the CA 2006, s 33, the provisions of a company are still a unique kind of contract that binds
the company and its members. CA 2006, s 33 remains exempt from the Contracts (Rights of
Thirds Parties) Act 1999 just as CA 1985, s 14 did. This is so that provisions of a companyâ€™s
constitution will not give rights to persons other than the company and its members.
Under CA 2006, s 303, members may require directors to call general meetings and move
resolutions (CA 2006, s 303(5)(a)). They also have the right to inspect certain records and
documents which a company is obliged to keep (CA 2006, s 358) and the right to appoint a
proxy to represent them at meetings of the company (CA 2006, s 324). Financially, it represents what a member must pay or has paid for the share, and it provides a basis for the calculation of distributions of profits by means of dividends. The assets of the company are owned
by the company. The members do not have a legal or equitable interest in them (Macaura v
âž¨ See p. 5 Northern Assurance, 1925 (see Chapter 1 âž¨), and although share capital is in a sense a
liability, it is not in the nature of a debt owed by the company, and on a winding-up the
shareholders will receive what is left, if anything, after payment of the companyâ€™s debts and
liabilities. Shares are personal estate and not real estate. They are, therefore, in the same
category as money or goods. The section removes doubts raised by early cases as to whether
shares in companies formed mainly to hold and manage land were not themselves of the legal
nature of realty.
Subscribersâ€™ contract
Where shares or debentures are offered to existing members, which is obligatory unless
waived by special resolution of the members in plcs, the letter of rights or provisional letter of
allotmentis an offer, and no notification of acceptance is required. Acceptance is by conduct,
as where the member pays an instalment of the purchase price or renounces the allotment to
another person, as where he sells his rights (Re New Eberhardt Co ex parte Menzies(1889) 43
Ch D 118). Where there is a placingof any balance not taken up, the companyâ€™s brokers offer
the shares to their clients who can accept the offer.

Authority to issue
CA 2006, ss 549-551
The CA 2006 removes for private companies the requirement for prior authorisation in certain situations (CA 2006, s 550). The CA 2006 also removes the requirement that a companyâ€™s
constitution have to contain a limit on the number of shares that the directors are authorised
CA 2006, s 549 states that the directors of a company must not exercise any power of the
company to allot shares in the company except as provided for in CA 2006, s 550 (private
company with a single class of shares) or CA 2006, s 551 (authorisation by a company). CA
2006, s 549 replaces 80(1), (2), (9) and (10) of the CA 1985. It requires that the directors not
allot shares (or grant rights to subscribe for shares or to convert any security into shares)
except in accordance with ss 550 and 551 respectively. Under the CA 2006, s 550, where a
private company has only one class of shares, the directors may exercise any power of the
company to allot shares of that class or to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into such shares, except to the extent that they are prohibited from doing so by the companyâ€™s articles. CA 2006, s 551 is the provision that covers authorisation by the company to
allow directors power to allot shares. The directors of a company may exercise power to allot
shares in the company or to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares
in the company, if they are authorised to do so by the companyâ€™s articles or by resolution of
the company. The special provision in the CA 1985 (s 80(2)) respecting the allotment of
shares to employees remains and is now part of the CA 2006, s 549(2).
Allotments made in contravention of the above provisions will not be invalid but the directors are liable to prosecution. Furthermore, the provisions do not apply to shares taken by
subscribers to the memorandum or to shares allotted as part of an employeesâ€™ share scheme.
If members refuse to authorise directors to allot shares, the power of allotment, except in
relation to employeesâ€™ s hares, lies in the members themselves by ordinary resolution in general meeting. Before leaving the topic of authority to issue shares, it is worth noting that,
because of the fiduciary duties which the directors owe the company, they must use the power
of allotment for the â€˜proper purposeâ€™, which means to raise capital for the company and not,
for example, to put off a takeover bid to keep themselves in control of the company.
Pre-emption rights
As regards ordinary (or equity) shareholders, the CA 2006, s 561 gives a right of pre-emption.
This is designed to ensure that the rights of ordinary shareholders are not necessarily affected
by the issue of further ordinary shares to others, which has never been regarded as a variation
of rights. The section gives pre-emption rights to all equity shareholders in both public and
private companies. Each ordinary shareholder must be offered a part of the issue pro rata to
his existing holding. The offer must be in writing and delivered to the shareholders personally or by post. Equity shares may be offered to outsiders if they have not been taken up
by existing shareholders within the offer period, which must be at least 21 days. Regulation 2
of The Companies (Share Capital and Acquisition by Company of its Own Shares) Regulations
2009 (SI 2009/2022) amended the minimum notice period for pre-emption rights from

Chapter 11 Shares - generally
21 days to 14 days. The Listing Rules were changed to reduce the minimum rights issue subscription period to 10 business days. Only when this date has expired or when the company
has received a reply from every shareholder accepting or refusing the offer may the securities
be allotted freely.
If CA 2006, s 561 is not complied with, the company and any officer knowingly in default
is liable under the CA 2006, s 568 to compensate shareholders for their loss. Claims by shareholders must be brought within two years of the filing of the return of allotments under which
the section was contravened.
A private, but not a public, company may disapply pre-emption rights without a time limit
by a provision in the memorandum or articles stating this, or by having a provision in the
memorandum or articles about pre-emption rights which is inconsistent with the statutory
rules CA 2006, s 569. The pre-emption right is disapplied until such time, if any, as the memorandum or articles, as the case may be, are amended to remove the disapplication provision.
Both public and private companies may under CA 2006, ss 570 and 571 disapply preemption rights by a provision in the articles or by a special (or written if a private company)
resolution of the members. In either event, the maximum period for disapplication is five years
or such shorter period as the articles or special resolution may state.
Even in a private company which has given the directors a power of allotment for an
indefinite period, the members must still approve the disapplication of pre-emption rights
though the written resolution procedure can be used to do this. This assumes that the private
company has not opted out of the pre-emption provisions altogether (see above).
The pre-emption provisions are triggered by an issue of equity shares for cash. Thus preemption rights would not apply, e.g. to an issue of preference shares for cash or to the issue
of equity shares for a non-cash consideration, as in a merger of two companies where the
shares in the company to be acquired are exchanged for shares in the acquiring company and
the company to be acquired is then wound up following the transfer of its assets to the acquiring company. In addition, pre-emption rights do not apply where shares are allotted under
an employeesâ€™ scheme. Thus, if the company allots shares to employees under an employeesâ€™
scheme, it is not obliged to make an offer of shares to the ordinary shareholders who are not
employees. However, employees in a share scheme are entitled to participate in the preemption rights where an offer of equity shares is made to shareholders generally.
Thus, if a company, A, has an authorised and issued share capital of Â£100,000 divided into
100,000 ordinary shares of Â£1 each and 50,000 of those shares are held under an employeesâ€™
share scheme, then on an increase of capital and a proposal to issue 50,000 additional ordinary shares, each member will be entitled to an offer to subscribe for one share for every two
ordinary shares which he currently holds.
The directors must recommend the disapplication of pre-emption rights, and no special
resolution to allow it or a special resolution to renew a period of disapplication previously
approved may be proposed, unless with the notice of the meeting the directors have circulated
a written statement giving their reasons for recommending disapplication and stating the
amount which will be paid when the equity shares which are the subject of the disapplication
are allotted and giving the directorsâ€™ justification of that price. There are penalties for the
inclusion of misleading matter in this statement.
A shareholder may waive his pre-emption rights, in which case he will not be entitled
to receive shares under a pre-emptive offer. In addition, shares which are offered on a preemptive basis may be allotted to a person in favour of whom the shareholder entitled to the
offer has renounced his rights.

Return of an allotment
A copy of the resolution must be filed with the Registrar of Companies within 15 days of
it being passed (ss 29-30, CA 2006).
The Registrar must under CA 2006, ss 1077 and 1078, publish a notice in the London
Gazette of the receipt by him of a resolution passed in connection with disapplication of preemption rights.
It will be seen from what is said above that even when the directors have been given authority to issue shares they must still observe the pre-emption provisions outlined above.
Public companies: the 25 per cent rule
CA 2006, s 586 provides that shares in a public company cannot be allotted until 25 per cent
of the nominal value and 100 per cent of any premium have been received (in cash or otherwise) by the company, and also that the CA 2006, s 593 contains restrictions upon the allot-
âž¨ See p. 243 ment of shares for a non-cash consideration (see Chapter 12 âž¨).
An allottee who takes shares in a public company which are not paid up as required is liable
to pay the company the balance up to the minimum the company should have received plus
interest, which is at present 5 per cent per annum (CA 2006, s 592).
Allotment is usually made by the directors at a properly constituted board meeting, or by
a committee of the board where the directors have power to delegate their powers to such
a committee.
CA 2006, s 554 sets forth the requirements with respect to registration of allotment. In
particular, such registration must take as soon as practicable but in no event later than two
months after the date of the allotment. This registration requirement within two month is not
applicable where the company has issued a share warrant pursuant to CA 2006, s 779.
Return of an allotment
Under CA 2006, s 555 (as under CA 1985, s 88), whenever a company makes an allotment of
its shares, it must within one month of allotment deliver to the Registrar of Companies a
return of the allotments stating the number and nominal value of the shares comprised in the
allotment, the names and addresses of the allottees, and the amount paid up and unpaid on
each share, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium.
Where shares have been allotted as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash, as where,
for example, the shares form the whole or part of the purchase price on a sale of land to the
company, the consideration must be specified in the return, and if the contract is written,
it must be sent with the return. If the contract is not written, a written memorandum of
its terms must be made out and filed with the Registrar. These provisions are, of course,
strengthened for public companies by CA 2006, s 597 (requirement to file with return of allotment an expertâ€™s report on the value of non-cash consideration) (see Chapter 12 ).
Compliance with these requirements is enforced by a substantial fine on every director,
manager, secretary or other officer of the company who is a party to the default. The court
may grant relief where the omission to deliver any document within the time prescribed is
accidental or due to inadvertence or it is just and equitable to grant relief, and may make
an order extending the time for the delivery of the document for such period as the court
thinks proper.

Chapter 11 Shares - generally
Return of allotments and Companies House
CA 2006, s 555 replaces CA 1985, s 88. As under both, within one month of an allotment of
new shares in a limited company, the company is required to make a return of allotments to
the registrar. Such return must now be accompanied by a statement of capital which is a new
requirement. CA 2006, s 556 is applicable to an unlimited company that allots shares of a class
with rights not uniform with shares previously allotted.
Share certificates
The CA 2006 contains the provisions with respect to the certification and transfer of securities. Part 21 is divided into Chapters 1 (general provisions on certification and transfer of
securities) and 2 (evidencing and transfer of title to securities without written certificate).
Share certificates are evidence of a title (CA 2006, s 768). CA 2006, s 769 sets out responsibilities of a company as to issue of certificates on allotment. CA 2006, s 770 covers the procedure
for registration of a transfer, namely, that a company may not register a transfer of shares in
or debentures of a company unless a proper instrument of transfer is issued. CA 2006, s 771
provides that when a transfer of shares in or debentures of a company has been lodged with
the company, the company must either register the transfer or give the transferee notice of
refusal to register transfer of shares (or debentures) together with its reasons for the refusal.
CA 2006, s 771 is not applicable with regard to a transfer of shares if the company has issued
a share warrant in respect of the shares (CA 2006, s 779) or in relation to the transmission of
shares or debentures by operation of law (CA 2006, s 771(4)(b)). CA 2006, s 771 is new and
implements the recommendations of the Company Law Review. Under CA 2006, s 779 a
company limited by shares may if permitted in its articles issue a share warrant stating that
the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares specified in it.
Every company must, under the penalty of a fine for every officer of the company for each
day of the default, within two months after allotment or transfer of shares or debentures have
ready for delivery a certificate, unless in the case of an issue of shares the terms of the issue
otherwise provide (CA 2006, s 769). CA 2006, s 741 obliges a company to register an allotment
of debentures as soon as practice but in any event within two months after their allotment.
The form of the certificate is governed by the articles which may provide for the issue
of share certificates under seal, though a seal is not required by law. The certificate will also
specify the shares to which it relates and the amount paid up on the shares. It will be signed
by at least one director and the secretary (CA 2006, s 768). If the current Table A applies, every
certificate must be under the â€˜common sealâ€™ of the company especially for use on securities,
if it has a seal (CA 2006, s 50(1) (restating CA 1985, s 40)). This requirement can also be found
in the Model Articles for Private Companies Limited by Shares (Article 24) and the Model
Articles for Public Companies (Article 47) but it can be a â€˜common sealâ€™ or a â€˜securities sealâ€™.
Shares must be distinguished by an appropriate number, but if all the shares of the company are fully paid, or all the shares in a particular class are fully paid and rank pari passuin
all respects, the distinguishing numbers can be dispensed with.
A share certificate under the common seal of the company or the seal kept (if any) by virtue
of CA 2006, s 50(1) (restating CA 1985, s 40) specifying any shares held by any member is
prima facie, but not conclusive, evidence of the title of the member to the shares.

Share certificates
The articles usually empower the directors to renew share certificates which have been lost
or destroyed. A small fee is charged, but the shareholder must give the company an indemnity
in case any liability should fall upon it by reason of the possibility of two share certificates
in respect of the same holding being in existence. Where the certificate is defaced or worn out,
delivery of the old certificate to the company is required.
Chapter 2 to Part 21 concerns the provisions evidencing and transferring of title to securities without written instrument. CA 2006, s 784 sets out the power of HM Treasury and
Secretary of State to make regulations about transfer of title to securities without written
instrument. CA 2006, s 786 provides that regulations may be made enabling members of a
company or of any designated class of companies, to adopt, by ordinary resolution, arrangements under which title to securities is required to be evidenced or transferred (or both) without a written instrument.
The doctrine of estoppel
By reason of the doctrine of estoppel a company may be unable in certain circumstances to
deny the truth of the particulars in the certificate even though they are incorrect. Once again,
it will be appreciated that the law relating to estoppel presupposes the existence of a share
certificate. It will be relevant mainly in private companies whose shares will not be transferred
through the CREST system. It will also be relevant to those members of public companies using
CREST who have opted for a share certificate which will be transferred through the company
itself by sending the certificate to the company together with an instrument of transfer.
(a) Estoppel as to title
The mere fact that at some time the company has issued to X a share certificate stating that
he is the holder of, say, 100 shares does not prevent the company from denying that X is the
holder at some future date. The certificate is only prima facie evidence that X was entitled to
the shares at the date of issue of the certificate.
However, if the company recognises the validity of Xâ€™s title by registering or certifying a
transfer to Y on the basis of the certificate, the company is estopped from denying Yâ€™s title,
because it has held out to Y that X has a title.
Where the transfer is a forgery, the original transferee under it will not normally obtain
a good title and the company will not normally be estopped from denying his title even if it
has issued a share certificate to him. But a purchaser from the original transferee, though not
getting a good title, can hold the company estopped by the certificate issued to him because
he did not take it under a forged transfer, the signature of the apparent owner being on the
transfer form.
Thus, if X owns some shares in a company and his clerk forges Xâ€™s signature on a form of
transfer and sells the shares to Y, then Y will not get a good title to the shares and the company will not be estopped by the certificate issued to him, because at this stage the share
certificate is one which the company issued to the true owner, X, and the company has played
no part in the deception. If, however, Y transfers the shares to Z before the forgery is discovered, and Z is issued with a share certificate, then the company will be estopped as against Z,
and will have to pay him the value of the shares as damages if he chooses to sue the company
rather than Y. This is because the company issued a share certificate to Y who was not the
owner, thereby facilitating the deception. Nevertheless, Z will not become a member by virtue
of estoppel and Xâ€™s name must be restored to the register.

Chapter 11 Shares - generally
(b) Estoppel as to payment
In similar circumstances to those outlined above, the company may be estopped from denying that the shares are fully paid, or paid up to the extent stated on the certificate, even though
the effect of this is that the shares are issued at a discount. However, the directors who issue
the certificate are liable to the company for the unpaid share capital which cannot now be
recovered (Hirsche vSims[1894] AC 654). This estoppel does not apply to a person such as
an original allottee under a prospectus who knows how much he has paid up on the shares.
The doctrine of estoppel does not operate if the certificate itself is a forgery and in addition
is issued by a person without apparent authority (Ruben vGreat Fingall Consolidated, 1906,
âž¨ See p. 113 see Chapter 5 âž¨).
The estoppel does not seem to be defeated by the fact that the entries in the register of
members show who the true owner is even though the register is accessible to the public for
inspection, but there can certainly be no estoppel in favour of a person who actually knows
the true facts.
Finally, there can, in general, be no claim on an estoppel without some detriment to the
person making the claim. The detriment usually arises because the claimant has bought the
shares or lent money on a mortgage of them. It is not normally available to a person who has
received the shares as a gift.
Share warrants (or bearer shares)
Section 779 of the CA 2006 applies to the issuance of share warrants or bearer shares. A company limited by shares may issue with respect to any fully paid shares a warrant stating that
the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares specified in it. Public and also private companies may, if authorised by their articles, issue in respect of fully paid shares a share warrant
under the common seal stating that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares specified
Article 51 of the Mode l Articles for Public Companies authorises the issuance of share
warrants at the discretion of the board. Table Adoes not authorise the issue of share warrants.
Although share warrants could be issued under a prospectus, it has been the case in the past
that they have been exchanged for registered shares and the procedures described below
relate to that situation. When a share warrant is issued the company must strike out of the
register of members the name of the holder of the shares and make the following entries in
the register:
(a) the fact of the issue of the warrant;
(b) a statement of the shares included in the warrant, distinguishing each share by its number, if the shares had numbers; and
(c) the date of issue of the warrant.
The bearer of the warrant is, unless the articles provide to the contrary, entitled to be registered as a member on surrender of the warrant.
Difficulties arise as to the rights of holders of warrants because, although they are always
shareholders, they are not members, since they are not entered on the register of members,
though the bearer of a share warrant may, if the articles so provide, be deemed to be a member of the company either to the full extent or for any purpose defined in the articles. Their

rights are in fact governed by the articles, but dividends are usually obtained by handing over
to the company coupons which are detachable from the warrant, the payment of dividend
being advertised.
The articles may deprive the holders of share warrants of their voting rights, but usually
they are given the right to vote if they deposit their warrants with the company, or, if the warrant is deposited at a bank, on production of a certificate from the bank. The holding of share
warrants is not sufficient to satisfy a directorâ€™s share qualification.
A share warrant operates as an estoppel that the holder has a title now, and not that he once
did when the warrant was issued. Hence, the company must recognise the holder unless the
warrant is a forgery issued by a person without apparent authority.
A share warrant is also negotiable, so that a title to it passes free from defects in the title
of previous holders on mere delivery (Webb, Hale & Co v Alexandria Water Co (1905)
93 LT 339).
The main advantages of share warrants are anonymity, i.e. no one can find out from the
companyâ€™s public records who the owner of a warrant is, and the ease of transfer. Warrants
are merely handed to the purchaser avoiding the formality and expense involved in transferring a registered share. The main disadvantage is that company law leaves it entirely to the
company as to how it communicates with its warrant holders. Advertisements, e.g. of meetings, may not always be seen by warrant holders who may therefore not attend and vote.
It is usual today for a company to specify in the terms of issue that money due on the shares
is payable by stated instalments. These are not really calls but are contractual instalments
which the member is bound to pay on the dates mentioned by virtue of taking an allotment
of the shares. Where the method of instalments is used, the company cannot ask for the
money sooner by relying on a general power to make calls under the articles.
A call proper is made in a situation where the company did not lay down a date for
payment in the terms of issue of the shares. Since shares are generally fully paid up now within
a short time after allotment under a fixed installment arrangement, calls are not common
The articles usually give the directors power to make calls subject to certain restrictions,
e.g. Table A provides that subject to the terms of allotment, the directors may make calls upon
the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether in respect of nominal
value or premium) and each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 daysâ€™ notice specifying when and where payment is to be made) pay to the company as required by the notice the
amount called on his shares. A call may be required to be paid by instalments.
A call may, before receipt by the company of any sum due thereunder, be revoked in whole
or part and payment of a call may be postponed in whole or part. A person under whom a call
is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer
of the shares in respect of which the call was made. Table A must be complied with, otherwise
there can be no action against the shareholders in respect of the call.
Table A also provides that a call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the
resolution of the directors authorising the call was passed. Joint holders of a share are jointly
and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.

Chapter 11 Shares - generally
The Model Articles for Public Companies (Articles 54-62)cover the procedures involved
in the issuance of calls, liability of members to pay a call when asked, forfeiture procedures,
etc. The directors may send a call notice to a member requiring the member to pay the company a specified sum of money (the â€˜callâ€™) which is payable in respect of shares which that
member holds at the date when the directors decide to send the call notice. A call notice may
not require a member to pay a call which exceeds the total sum unpaid on that memberâ€™s
shares (whether as to the shareâ€™s nominal value or any amount payable to the company by
way of premium); must state when and how any call to which it relates is to be paid; and
may permit or require the call to be paid by instalments. A member must comply with the
requirements of a call notice, but no member is obliged to pay any call before 14 days have
passed since the notice was sent.
In those cases where the articles do not give the directors power to make calls, then the
company may make them by ordinary resolution in general meeting. The resolution of the
board or the members must state the amount of the call and the date on which it is payable
(Re Cawley & Co (1889) 42 Ch D 209). It is essential that calls be made equally on all the
shareholders of the same class unless the terms of issue and the companyâ€™s articles otherwise
provide. Table A authorises such an arrangement, but that does not entitle directors to make
calls on all shareholders except themselves (Alexander v Automatic Telephone Co [1900] 2
Ch 56) unless the other shareholders knowand approveof the arrangement.
An irregularity in the making of the call may make the call invalid. Any major irregularity
in procedure, as where there is no quorum at the meeting, or where the directors are not
properly appointed, will have that effect, although CA 2006, s 161 (replacing CA 1985, s 285)
may validate the call since it provides that the acts of a director or manager shall be valid
notwithstanding any defect which may afterwards be discovered in his appointment or
qualification. Minor irregularities will not invalidate a call (Shackleford, Ford & Co v
Dangerfield(1868) LR 3 CP 407).
All money payable by any member to the company under the memorandum or the articles
is in the nature of a specialty debt. This allows the company to sue for unpaid calls up to
12 years after the date upon which payment became due (Limitation Act 1980, s 8). The directors may charge interest on calls unpaid, and Table A provides that if a call remains unpaid
after it has become due and payable, the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay
interest on the amount unpaid from the day it became due and payable until it is paid at the
rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the share or in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed,
at the appropriate rate (as defined by the Companies Act and currently 5 per cent) but the
directors may waive payment of the interest wholly or in part.
The company may also accept payment in advance of calls if the articles so provide. Such
payments are loans, and interest is usually paid on them.
Default in payment gives the company a lien over the shares for the amount unpaid.
Table A, Regs 20-22 provide for forfeiture of shares for non-payment of a call or instalment as well as do Articles 58-62 of the Model Articles for Public Companies.
Mortgages of shares
Mortgages of shares may be either legal or equitable.

Mortgages of shares
Legal mortgages
In order that there shall be a legal mortgage, the mortgagee or lender must be entered on the
register of members. To achieve this, the shares which are being used as a security must be
transferred to him or his nominee. A separate agreement will set out the terms of the loan,
and will also contain an undertaking by the lender to retransfer the shares to the mortgagor
when the loan and interest are repaid. A legal mortgage gives the lender maximum security.
With a legal mortgage the lender (mortgagee) or his nominee is on the register and therefore appears to the outside world to be the absolute owner whereas he has a duty to transfer
to the borrower on the repayment of the loan. Thus the borrower (mortgagor) should serve
a â€˜stop noticeâ€™ (see below) upon the company to prevent an unauthorised sale of the shares by
the lender.
During the period that the loan is outstanding the lender will be entitled to all of the rights
attaching to the shares, e.g. dividends. Because he is registered he will receive all communications from the company and is thus in a better position to reach decisions affecting the value
of his security, e.g. whether to subscribe for a rights issue or cast his vote against or in favour
of such important issues as reorganisation or takeover bids.
Equitable mortgages
Such a mortgage is more usual than a legal mortgage, particularly in the case of a short-term
loan and in the case of shares in a private company where pre-emption provisions in the
âž¨ See p. 227 articles (see this chapter âž¨) may prevent the registration of the lender, and may be achieved
in the following ways.
(a) Mere deposit of the share certificate with the lender
This is sufficient to create an equitable mortgage, given that the intention to do so is present,
but if the lender wishes to enforce his security, he must ask the court for an order for sale, and
having sold the shares under the order, he must account to the borrower for the balance if the
proceeds exceed the amount of the loan. Alternatively, the lender can apply for an order of
foreclosure which vests the ownership of the shares in him, and if such an order is made, the
lender is not obliged to account to the borrower for any excess. For this reason foreclosure is
difficult to obtain.
(b) Deposit of share certificate plus a blank transfer
Where the borrower deposits the share certificate along with a transfer form, signed by him
but with the transfereeâ€™s name left blank, the seller has an implied authority to sell the shares
by completing the transfer in favour of a purchaser, or in favour of himself if he so wishes,
and in such a case there is no need to go to the court. Once again, a separate agreement will
set out the terms of the loan, and provide for the delivery of the certificate and blank transfer
on repayment of the loan plus interest.
The methods of equitable mortgage outlined above do not necessarily ensure the priority
of the lender as against other persons with whom the borrower may deal in respect of the
shares. Where the borrower obtains another certificate from the company and sells to a bona
fide purchaser for value who then obtains registration, that purchaser will have priority over
the original lender.

Chapter 11 Shares - generally
It is no use in the borrower in a legal mortgage or the original lender in an equitable
mortgage (L) writing to the company telling it of his interest, because by s 126 of the CA 2006,
restating s 360 of the CA 1985 and Reg 5 of Table A, a company cannot take notice of any
trust or similar right over its shares. However, a borrower or lender, as appropriate, may
protect himself by serving on the company a stop notice under the Rules of the Supreme
Court. He will file at the Central Office of the Supreme Court an affidavit declaring the
nature of his interest in the shares, accompanied by a copy of the notice addressed to the company and signed by the applicant. Copies of the affidavit and the notice are then served on
the company.
It is, however, unusual for lenders to take legal mortgages (where the shares are registered
in the name of the lender or its nominee). Equitable mortgages are more common (where the
lender holds the share certificate(s) and a blank, executed stock transfer form in respect of the
charged shares and the shares are only registered in the name of the lender or its nominee on
enforcement of the security).
Once the stop notice has been served, the company cannot register a transfer or pay a
dividend, if the notice extends to dividends, without first notifying L. However, after the
expiration of 14 days from the lodgement of the transfer or notice of payment of a dividend,
the company is bound to make the transfer or pay the dividend unless in the meantime L has
obtained an injunction from the court prohibiting it.
A judgment creditor of a registered owner of shares may obtain an order charging the shares
with payment of the judgment debt. Notice of the making of the order, or demand for the dividend, when served upon the company, has a similar effect to a stop notice (see above), in that
until the charging order is discharged or made absolute the company cannot allow a transfer
except with the authority of the court. A charging order has no priority over a mortgage
created by deposit of the share certificate and a blank transfer before the date on which the
charging order was made.
The relevant specifics can be found at RSC Part 73, Charging Orders, Stop Orders and
Stop Notices available at: http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/
part73.htm#IDAEVOVB
CA 2006, s 670 provides that a lien or other charge on a companyâ€™s own shares (whether taken
expressly or otherwise) is void except as permitted in the section. With respect to any kind of
company, a charge is permissible if the shares are not fully paid up and the charge is for an
amount in respect of the shares. However, if the company is one whose ordinary business
includes lending of money or consists of provision of credit or bailment, a charge is permissible if it arises in connection with a transaction entered into by the company in the ordinary
course of business.
The articles often give the company a first and paramount lien over its shares for unpaid
calls, or even for general debts owed to the company by shareholders, but the Stock Exchange
will not give a listing where there is a lien on fully paid shares. However, a lien is permitted
over partly paid shares for amounts called or payable on the shares. It is usual also for the
articles to give a power of sale. Table A gives such a power of sale, but requires 14 daysâ€™ notice
in writing to the shareholder or his representatives before the sale takes place, during which

Forfeiture of shares
time the money owed can be paid and the sale prevented. Since on a sale the shareholder or
his representatives will probably not co-operate in the necessary transfer, the articles usually
provide, as Table A does, that a purchaser shall get a good title if the transfer is signed by a
person nominated by the directors. If the articles create a lien but give no power of sale, the
company would have to obtain an order for sale from the court.
A lien, other than for amounts due on the shares, cannot be enforced by forfeiture even
if a power to forfeit is contained in the articles. Thus a company cannot enforce a lien for
general debts by forfeiture even if its articles so provide.
The companyâ€™s lien takes priority over all equitable interests in the shares, e.g. those of
equitable mortgages, unless, when the shareholder becomes indebted to the company, it has
actual notice of the equitable interest.
The Bradford Banking Co Ltdv Henry Briggs, Son & Co Ltd
(1886) 12 App Cas 29
The respondent was a trading company carrying on the business of a colliery. The articles of the
company provided that it should have â€˜a first and permanent lien and charge available at law and
in equity upon every share for all debts due from the holder thereofâ€™. John Easby, a coal merchant,
became a shareholder in the respondent company, and deposited his certificates with the bank as
security for the overdraft on his current account. The bank gave notice to the company that the
shares had been so deposited. Easby owed the respondent company money, having done trade
with it, and he also owed money to the bank. The question for decision was whether the company
was entitled to recoup its debts by exercising a lien and sale on the shares, or whether the bank
was entitled to sell as mortgagees.
Held- by the House of Lords - that the respondent company could not claim priority over the bank
in respect of the shares for money which became due from Easby after the notice given by the
bank. The notice served by the bank was not a notice of trust under s 30 of the Companies Act
1862 (CA 1985, s 360 replaced by CA 2006, s 126), but must be regarded in the same light as
notice between traders regarding their interests.
A company is not ordinarily bound to take notice of a trust or other equitable interest over its
shares. It is, however, bound by such a notice when the company itself is also claiming an interest, e.g. a lien, over the shares in competition with the person who gives notice.
The lien attaches to dividends payable in respect of the shares subject to the lien (Hague v
Dandeson(1848) 2 Exch 741).
Forfeiture of shares
Shares may be forfeited by a resolution of the board of directors if, and only if, an express
power to forfeit is given in the articles. Where such an express power exists, it must be strictly
followed, otherwise the forfeiture may be annulled. The Model Article for Public Companies
provides for express power to forfeit in Article 59. Further, the object of the forfeiture must
be for the benefit of the company and not to give some personal advantage to a director or

Chapter 11 Shares - generally
shareholder, e.g. in order to allow him to avoid liability for the payment of calls where the
shares have fallen in value as in Re Esparto Trading(1879) 12 Ch D 191.
The articles usually provide that shares may be forfeited where the member concerned does
not pay a call made upon him, whether the call is in respect of the nominal value of the shares
or of premium.
The usual procedure is for a notice to be served on the member asking for payment, and
stating that if payment is not made by a specific date, not earlier than 14 days from the date
of the notice, the shares may be forfeited. If payment is not so made, the company may
forfeit the shares and make an entry of forfeiture on the register of members. Once the shares
have been forfeited, the member should be required to return the share certificate or other
document of title so as to obviate fraud. A forfeiture operates to reduce the companyâ€™s issued
capital, since it cancels the liability of the member concerned to pay for his shares in full, but
even so the sanction of the court is not required; a mere power in the articles is enough.
Shares cannot be forfeited except for non-payment of calls and any provision in the
articles to the contrary is void.
Reissue of forfeited shares
Forfeited shares may be reissued to a purchaser so long as the price which he pays for the
shares is not less than the amount of calls due but unpaid at forfeiture.
Suppose X is the holder of 100 shares of Â£1 each on which 75p per share has been called
up, and X does not pay the final call of 25p per share, as a result of which the shares are
forfeited. If they are reissued to Y, then Y must pay not less than Â£25 for them, and any sum
received in excess of that amount from Y will be considered as share premium and must be
credited to a share premium account. Thus, although Y appears to have bought the shares at a
discount, this is not so because the company has received the full amount of the called-up
capital, i.e. Â£75 from X and Â£25 from Y.
The companyâ€™s articles usually provide (as Table A does) that if any irregularity occurs
in the forfeiture procedure, the person to whom the forfeited shares are reissued will nevertheless obtain a good title . This is found in Article 61(3) of the Model Articles for Public
Companies.
Liability of person whose shares are forfeited
Forfeiture of shares means that the holder ceases to be a member of the company, but his
liability in respect of the shares forfeited depends upon the articles.
(a) Where there is no provision in the articles with regard to liability, the former holder is discharged from liability, and no action can be brought by the company against him for calls
due at the date of the forfeiture unless the company is wound up within one year of it. In
such a case the former holder may be put on the B list of contributories in the winding-up,
and may be called upon to pay the calls due at the date of the forfeiture unless they have
been paid by another holder.
(b) The articles may provide (as does Table A and Article 60 of the Model Articles for Public
Companies) that the former holder shall be liable to pay the calls due but unpaid at the
date of forfeiture, whether the company is in liquidation or not, unless they have been
paid to the company by a subsequent holder.

Surrender of shares
Surrender of shares
The directors of a company cannot accept a surrender of shares unless the articles so provide.
There is no provision in Table A (in contrast to Article 62 of the Model Articles for Public
Companies) but it would seem from decided cases that directors may accept surrender:
(a) where the circumstances are such that the shares could have been forfeited under the
articles (per Lord Herschell in Trevor vWhitworth(1887) 12 App Cas 409); and
(b) where shares are surrendered as part of a scheme to exchange existing shares for new
shares of the same nominal value, the new shares having perhaps slightly different rights
and the old shares being either cancelled or available for reissue.
In other circumstances surrender is not allowed (see below).
Bellerbyv Rowland & Marwoodâ€™s SS Co Ltd[1902] 2 Ch 14
Three directors of the company, Bellerby, Moss and Marwood, agreed to surrender several of their
shares to the company so that they might be reissued. The object of the surrender was not that
the directors could not pay the calls, the shares being of nominal value Â£11 with Â£10 paid, but to
assist the company to make good the loss of one of its ships, the Golden Cross, valued at Â£4,000.
The surrender was accepted but the shares were not in fact reissued. The company survived the
loss and became prosperous, and in this action the directors sought to be returned to the register
as members, claiming that the earlier surrender was invalid.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that it was invalid since the surrender was not accepted because
of non-payment of calls or inability to pay them, and so the directors must be restored to the register of members.
This decision is essentially to the effect that a company cannot evade the rules relating to reduction of capital by taking a surrender of its partly paid shares.
Treatment of forfeited and surrendered shares in public companies
The above material relating to forfeiture and surrender is still valid because it relates to the
source of the power to forfeit or surrender and the surrounding circumstances. However, the
treatment of forfeited and surrendered shares once this has happened is a matter for the CA
2006, s 662. CA 2006, s 662 provides that no voting rights may be exercised by the company
so long as the shares are forfeited or surrendered and also that the company must dispose of
the shares within three years. If they are not disposed of, they must be cancelled. If the shares
are cancelled and the cancellation has the effect of reducing the companyâ€™s allotted share
capital below the authorised minimum, the directors must apply for the company to be reregistered as a private company. There are, however, certain relaxations in the procedures
in this event. In particular, only a directorsâ€™ resolution is required to make the necessary
reduction application, and any alterations to the memorandum that are necessary. The company does not need to apply to the court to obtain confirmation of the reduction in capital
but any resolution passed by the directors must be filed with the Registrar. If a company fails
to comply with either the requirement to cancel or the requirement to re-register as a private
company, the company and its officers in default become liable to a fine.

Shares - transfer and transmission

Transfer of unlisted shares
This chapter is concerned with the way in which shares are transferred from one person to
another. It is necessary to distinguish between the transfer of unlisted shares and shares
which are listed on an investment exchange such as the Stock Exchange. Basically the material in this chapter covers the transfer of shares in a private company which cannot have a
listing on an investment exchange. The rules, however, could apply to a plc which had not
sought a listing on an investment exchange.
Transfer of unlisted shares
As we have seen, shares are personal property and are transferable subject to any restriction
contained in the articles. A company cannot register a transfer of shares or debentures unless
a proper instrument of transfer, duly stamped, has been delivered to the company and executed by or on behalf of the transferor (CA 2006, s 770). No formal transfer is required when
a company purchases its own shares, though stamp duty is payable. Thus an article which
provided for the automatic transfer of shares to a directorâ€™s widow on his death was held
invalid (Re Greene[1949] 1 All ER 167). The directors usually have power under articles such
as Table A to decline to register the transfer of a share, other than a fully paid share, to a
person of whom they do not approve, e.g. a minor or person of unsound mind who cannot
be bound by the contract; and also to decline to register the transfer of a share on which the
company has a lien, e.g. for calls made but not paid. Any power of veto on transfer vested by
the articles in the directors must be exercised within two months after the lodging of the
transfer for registration and the transferee notified. If not, the company may be compelled to
register the transferee as a member.
Re Swaledale Cleaners[1968] 3 All ER 619
On 3 August 1967 the sha reholding of the company was: H (deceased) 5,000; S 4,000; A (deceased)
500; L 500. S and L were directors of the company which was a private one. The companyâ€™s
articles provided that the quorum of directors should be two although a sole continuing director
had power to appoint an additional director. At a combined board meeting and annual general
meeting held on 3 August 1967, L retired by rotation and was not re-elected a director. The personal representatives of H and A had executed transfers of H and A shareholdings in favour of L,
but S as director refused to register them purporting to exercise a power of refusal contained in
the articles. There was no resolution either of the board or of the shareholders on the matter of
refusal to register the transfers. On 11 December 1967 L began proceedings for rectification of the
register, and on 18 December 1967 S appointed an additional director and the two directors
formally refused to register the transfers.
Held - by the Court of Appeal - the register must be rectified to show L as the holder of the shares
of H and A. The power to refuse a transfer must be construed strictly because a shareholder ordinarily has a right to transfer his shares. Furthermore, the delay in exercising the power of refusal,
i.e. four months, had been unreasonable and the power was no longer capable of being exercised.
The above case was followed by the High Court in Re Inverdeck Ltd[1998] 2 BCLC 242. This later
case stresses the need for directors in private companies as Inverdeck Ltd was to observe the

Chapter 12 Shares - transfer and transmission
relevant corporate formalities in their day-to-day transactions. The power in private companies to
refuse to register a transfer is a valuable one in that it can be used to prevent persons from acquiring rights in the company which the directors believe are contrary to its interests. Failure to observe
formalities can lead to this valuable power being lost.
Courtâ€™s power to rectify the register where no instrument
of transfer
It was held by the Court of Appeal in Re Hoicrest Ltd[1999] 2 BCLC 346 that the power of
the court to rectify the membership register of a company could be used to effect a transfer
where there was no instrument of transfer so that the company had not had an opportunity
to refuse the transfer. Although CA 2006, s 125 has traditionally been used in disputes
between a would-be shareholder and the company where following transfer the company
refuses registration, the section was not confined to that situation and could be used to settle
a dispute as to the ownership of shares between two members.
The legal transactions involved
The purchase and sale of shares involves the following separate and distinct legal transactions:
(a) An unconditional contract is agreed between the transferor and transferee. The transferor
then holds the shares as a trustee for the transferee (who has an equitable interest) until
registration but is still a member of the company and retains the right to vote as he chooses.
(b) The transferee pays for the shares. The position remains as in (a) above except that the
transferor must now vote as the transferee directs. An unpaid transferor has the right to
vote the shares free from any obligation to comply with the transfereeâ€™s requirements
(JRRT (Investments)v Haycraft[1993] BCLC 401).
(c) The position remains as in (b) above while the transfer is approved by the directors and
the transfer is stamped.
(d) The transfereeâ€™s name is entered on the register of members. At this stage the transferor
ceases to be a member of the company. The transferee becomes the member and acquires
the legal title to the shares. Since membership and membership rights are only effective
when the transferee is on the register of members, it may be necessary to ask the court to
rectify the register of members under CA 2006, s 125 where the company is refusing to
register the transferee, but only if this is contrary to the powers of the board.
The rights of persons to obtain registration or to claim under an equitable title are set out in
âž¨ See p. 259 Chapter 13 âž¨. Section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 declares void any transfer of shares
after the commencement of winding-up by the court, unless the court otherwise orders.
Form of transfer
Schedule 1 of the Stock Transfer Act 1963 introduced a new transfer form - a stock transfer
form, which is for general use with unlisted shares.
Registrars are required to accept for registration transfers in the form introduced by the
Act because it overrides any contrary provision regarding transfer, whether statutory or not.
Thus, the 1963 Act overrides any other provisions relating to the form of transfer in the

Transfer of listed shares
companyâ€™s articles. The signature of the transferor need not be witnessed, and the transferee
need not sign the transfer, nor need it be in the form of a deed.
It should be noted that the 1963 Act does not override provisions in the articles relating to
the rights of the directors to refuse registration.
The stock transfer form is not available to transfer partly paid shares or shares in an unlimited or guarantee company. If such companies are encountered, reference should be made to
the articles for the form of transfer to be used.
Procedure on transfer of unlisted shares
The method of transferring fully paid shares or stock is as follows.
The shareholder executes (signs) a stock transfer form in favour of the purchaser, and hands
it to the purchaser or his agent, together with the share certificate. The purchaser, or his agent,
sends the stock transfer form along with the certificate to the company for registration.
The purchaser need not sign the stock transfer form, nor need it be in the form of a deed. The
company secretary, following approval by the board, deletes the transferorâ€™s name from the
register of shareholders and replaces it with the transfereeâ€™s name and, within two months,
sends the share certificate to the transferee.
Transfer of listed shares
Transfers of shares with a listing on the London Stock Exchange are covered by the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3755). This area of the law is rather
specialised and only an outline of the system called CREST is given here.
The regulations provide for the system to be run by an approved operator which is
CRESTCo Ltd, a private company owned by a number of firms connected with all sectors of
the equities market. CRESTCo merged with Euroclear Bank in September 2002.
The system, which is known as CREST, is an electronic system which allows shareholders
to hold and transfer their securities in dematerialised form, i.e. without a share certificate.
A statement not unlike a bank statement reveals purchases and sales by the intermediaries
concerned.
CREST does not impose dematerialisation of shares on shareholders. Shareholders who
wish to become or remain uncertificated are able to do so. Institutional shareholders, such
as insurance companies, that are frequent traders will go for dematerialisation but less sophisticated shareholders will in many cases opt for the paper certificate regime, follow the method
of transfer described above and be on a separate register of members.
Uncertificated shareholders will appoint a custodian broker to hold the shares. The broker
will appear on the electronic register of members but can only deal with shares in accordance with the customer agreement between the shareholder and the custodian broker.
Shareholders who wish to retain paper certificates in listed companies may be forced to
appoint custodian brokers as nominees because of the Stock Exchange three-day rolling
settlement system under which an entire share transfer transaction must be completed in
three days. This is difficult to achieve under a paper certificate regime but easy under an electronic transfer regime. It is possible to opt for a ten-day settlement regime though it will be
necessary to find a stockbroker who operates it - some do.

Chapter 12 Shares - transfer and transmission
Once a nominee is installed, the shareholder will receive dividends and benefit from
capital growth but rights will be lost such as the right actually to attend meetings unless the
nominee can make arrangements for this, nor will the shareholder receive the annual report
and accounts unless the nominee asks for enough to send out to all his members, but this
would be a concession not a right.
The regulations make dematerialisation lawful and disapply CA 2006, s 769 under which
a share certificate must be provided to the transferee within two months after allotment or
transfer where the uncertificated regime applies, but not in the paper certificate regime.
Companies that wish to allow their shares to be transferred via CREST will have to change
their articles to add a relevant provision.
Finally, a company any of whose securities can be transferred through CREST must subdivide its register of members (or debenture holders) to show how many of those securities each
person holds in uncertificated form and certificated form respectively. An issuer of securities
can only rectify a register of securities in relation to uncertificated units with the consent of
CRESTCo or by order of the court.
Certification of transfers: unlisted shares
The above procedure assumes that on completion of the sale of registered unlisted shares the
seller delivers his share certificate to the purchaser together with the instrument of transfer.
Where he is selling all the shares represented by the certificate the seller will do this, but if he
is selling only part of his holding, or the whole of his holding but to more than one person,
he will instead send the share certificate and the executed transfer of the shares which the
purchaser is buying to the company so that the transfer may be certificated.
The company secretary or registrar or transfer agent will compare the share certificate and
the transfer with the register of members and if it appears that the seller is the owner of the
shares mentioned in the certificate and some of those shares are comprised in the transfer, the
secretary, registrar, or agent, as the case may be, will write in the margin of the transfer a note
that the share certificate has been lodged and will sign it on behalf of the company.
The certificated transfer is then returned to the seller, the share certificate being retained by
the company or the transfer agents. The seller will complete the sale by delivering the certificated
transfer to the purchaser who will accept it as equal to delivery of an uncertificated transfer
accompanied by the share certificate. The purchaser will then lodge the transfer with the company or its transfer agents for registration and the company will issue a new share certificate
to him for the shares he has bought and a new certificate showing the seller as the registered
holder of the balance of the shares which he retains if he retains any. Obviously, the seller will
not get a new certificate where he has sold his whole holding but to more than one person.
Liability arising out of certification
This is covered by CA 2006, s 775 and although a certification is not a warranty by the
company that the person transferring the shares has any title to them, it is a representation
by the company that documents have been produced to it which show prima facie title in
the transferor.
Where, therefore, the company or its agent fraudulently or negligently makes a false
certification, a purchaser who acts upon the false certification may sue the company for any
loss he may have incurred as a result.

Transfer of listed shares
For example, if the company certifies a transfer without production of a certificate, it may
be that the certificate has been used to make an uncertificated transfer to another purchaser.
If so, two purchasers now exist and both are eligible for entry on the register of members.
If the later purchaser achieves registration first, he will establish priority over the certificated
transferee who will not then be registered and the company will be liable in damages to the
certificated transferee for the loss he suffers thereby. However, if the company registers the
certificated transferee and refuses the other purchaser, it will not be liable to the latter because
the share certificate does not operate as an estoppel except as on the date of issue, which will
have been some time ago.
Forged transfers
If a company transfers shares under a forged instrument of transfer, the transferor whose
name has been forged must be restored to the register, and in so far as this puts the company
to expense or loss, it can claim an indemnity from the person presenting the transfer for registration, even though he is quite innocent of the forgery.
Sheffield Corporationv Barclay[1905] AC 392
Two persons, Timbrell and Honnywill, were joint owners of corporation stock. Timbrell, in fraud of
Honnywill, forged a transfer of the stock and borrowed money from the respondents on the security of the stock. The respondents sent the transfer to the corporation asking for registration, and they
were duly registered. Later the respondents sold the shares and the corporation issued certificates
to the purchasers who were also registered. Honnywill, after the death of Timbrell, discovered the
forgery, and the corporation replaced the stock which was the best course open to them, because
if they had taken the ultimate purchasers off the register of stockholders, they would have had to
pay damages to them by virtue of the doctrine of estoppel. The corporation now sued the respondents for an indemnity on the grounds that they had presented the forged transfer.
Held - by the House of Lords - the corporation succeeded. The person presenting a transfer
warrants that it is good, and the fact that he is innocent of any fraud does not affect this warranty.
The corporation, therefore, was entitled to recover from the respondents the value of the stock
replaced, leaving them to such remedies as they might have against Timbrellâ€™s estate.
(i) Where a person requests the registration of a share transfer which a company is under a duty
to effect there is implied in that request a warranty that the transfer is genuine. The rule applies
whether the transfer is in favour of the person presenting it or someone else, as where a broker
presents a transfer on behalf of a client.
(ii) The companyâ€™s loss, for which it needs an indemnity, will normally consist in buying in or issuing for no consideration new shares to recompense the original holder. The innocent transferee will
stay on the register of members by reason of the rules relating to estoppel that are described
above. The indemnity may be made by the fraudster if he presents the transfer but it may be presented by a broker on behalf of the fraudster where the company is listed. In these circumstances
the broker must give the indemnity, even though he may be innocent of the fraud, leaving him
to claim against the fraudster. This was the situation in the Barclay case and in Royal Bank of
Scotland plc v Sandstone Properties Ltd (1998) The Times, 12 March, where the facts were
similar and the Barclay case was followed.

Chapter 12 Shares - transfer and transmission
If the company issues a share certificate to the transferee under a forged transfer, the company
is not estopped from denying his title to the shares, but it may become estopped if it issues a
new certificate to a non-owner as part of a subsequent transfer transaction.
A company may inform the transferor that a transfer has been received for registration so
as to give him a chance to prevent a fraudulent transfer but a transferor is not prejudiced by
the fact that he has received notice, and may still deny the validity of the transfer.
Death of a holder in a joint account
A transfer is not needed to a surviving joint holder or holders on the death of one. In such
cases, it is usual for the company to receive a death certificate certified by the Registrar of
Births and Deaths. Photocopies are not official documents but some companies will accept
them if presented by a person of professional standing. Sometimes a grant of probate or
administration may be received and this is satisfactory evidence of death. The necessary alterations in the register of members are made on the basis of these documents and not on the
basis of the conventional instrument of transfer. The procedure is a form of transmission of
shares which is considered later in this chapter.
Companies whose articles restrict transfer
In the case of a company whose articles restrict transfer a transfer must be submitted to and
approved by the board and any restriction must be the decision of the directors.
Re Smithv Fawcett[1942] Ch 304 (Court of Appeal)
Article 10 of the articles of association of a private company provided: â€˜The directors may at any
time in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion refuse to register any transfer of shares, and cl.
19 of Table Ashall be modifi ed accordingly.â€™ The issued capital of the company consisted of 8002
ordinary shares of which the two directors of the company, J F and N S, held 4001 each. J F died,
and his son as his executor applied to have the testatorâ€™s shares registered in his name. N S
refused to consent to the registration, but offered to register 2,001 shares and to buy 2,000 at a
fixed price. The executor applied to the court by way of motion that the register of members of the
company might be rectified by inserting his name as the holder of the 4,001 shares. Lord Greene
MR observed:
The principles to be applied in cases where the articles of a company confer a discretion on directors
with regard to the acceptance of transfers of shares are, for the present purposes, free from doubt.
They must exercise their discretion bona fide in what they consider - not what a court may consider
- is in the interests of the company, and not for any collateral purpose. They must have regard to
those considerations, and those considerations only, which the articles on their true construction permit them to take into consideration, and in construing the relevant provisions in the articles it is to be
borne in mind that one of the normal rights of a shareholder is the right to deal freely with his property and to transfer it to whomsoever he pleases. When it is said, as it has been said more than once,
that regard must be had to this last consideration, it means, I apprehend, nothing more than that the
shareholder has such a prima facie right, and that right is not to be cut down by uncertain language
or doubtful implications. The right, if it is to be cut down, must be cut down with satisfactory clarity.
It certainly does not mean that articles, if appropriately framed, cannot be allowed to cut down the

Companies whose articles restrict transfer
right of transfer to any extent which the articles on their true construction permit. Another consideration which must be borne in mind is that this type of article is one which is for the most part confined
to private companies. Private companies are in law separate entities just as much as are public companies, but from the business and personal point of view they are much more analogous to partnerships than to public corporations. Accordingly, it is to be expected that in the articles of such a
company the control of the directors over the membership may be very strict indeed. There are, or
may be, very good business reasons why those who bring such companies into existence should give
them a constitution which confers on the directors powers of the widest description.
The language of the article in the present case does not point out any particular matter as being
the only matter to which the directors are to pay attention in deciding whether or not they will allow
the transfer to be registered. The article does not, for instance, say, as is to be found in some articles,
that they may refuse to register any transfer of shares to a person not already a member of the
company or to a transferee of whom they do not approve. Where articles are framed with some such
limitation on the discretionary power of refusal as I have mentioned in those two examples, it follows
on plain principle that if the directors go outside the matters which the articles say are to be the matters
and the only matters to which they are to have regard, the directors will have exceeded their powers.
Mr Spens, in his argument for the plaintiff, maintained that whatever language was used in the articles, the power of the directors to refuse to register a transfer must always be limited to matters personal
to the transferee and that there can be no personal objection to the plaintiff becoming a member of the
company because the directors are prepared to accept him as the holder of 2,000 of the shares which
have come to him as legal personal representative of his father. Mr Spens relies for his proposition on
observations in several authorities, but on examination of those cases it becomes clear that the form
of article then before the court by its express language confined the directors to the consideration of
the desirability of admitting the proposed transferee to membership on grounds personal to him...
There is nothing, in my opinion, in principle or in authority to make it impossible to draft such a
wide and comprehensive power to directors to refuse to transfer as to enable them to take into
account any matter which they conceive to be in the interests of the company, and thereby to admit
or not to admit a particular person and to allow or not to allow a particular transfer for reasons not
personal to the transferee but bearing on the general interests of the company as a whole - such
matters, for instance, as whether by their passing a particular transfer the transferee would obtain too
great a weight in the councils of the company or might even perhaps obtain control. The question,
therefore, simply is whether on the true construction of the particular article the directors are limited
by anything except their bona fide view as to the interests of the company. In the present case the
article is drafted in the w idest possible terms, and I decline to write into that clear language any limitation other than a limitation, which is implicit by law, that a fiduciary power of this kind must be exercised bona fide in the interests of the company. Subject to that qualification, an article in this form
appears to me to give the directors what it says, namely, an absolute and uncontrolled discretion.
Held- affirming Simonds J - that Article 10 gave the directors the widest powers to refuse to register a transfer, and that, while such powers are of a fiduciary nature and must be exercised in the
interests of the company, there was nothing to show that they had been otherwise exercised.
In practice these restrictions are normally found only in the articles of private companies.
Most plcs have their shares listed, or quoted, on a recognised investment exchange such as the
Stock Exchange, and the rules of the listing or quotation agreement do not permit restrictions
on transfer following sale. Consideration will be given to the right of pre-emption in private
companies and the general rules relating to rejection of transfers.
The right of pre-emption: generally
This means that when a member of a private company wishes to sell his shares, he must,
under a provision in the articles, first offer them to other members of the company before he

Chapter 12 Shares - transfer and transmission
offers them to an outsider. The price is usually to be calculated by some method laid down in
the articles, e.g. at a price fixed by the auditors of the company. In this context it should be
noted that the auditor can be sued by the seller of the shares if the valuation is lower than it
should be because of the auditorâ€™s negligence. This is an important claim because the seller
will not normally be able to avoid the contract of sale because that contract usually makes the
auditorâ€™s valuation final and binding on the parties.
However, a distinction must be made where the accountant or valuer has not merely made
a mistake in the valuation of the shares, but has not done what he was appointed to do. In
such a case the court can intervene and set the contract of purchase aside. Thus, in Macrov
Thompson [1997] 2 BCLC 626 an accountant/valuer was asked to value the shares in two
private companies for the purpose of a pre-emption purchase. In reaching conclusions as to
the valuation of company Aâ€™s shares, he mistakenly transposed the assets of company B,
which was less valuable. This transposition appeared in the judgment of an earlier decision of
the court in these proceedings. The contract to buy the shares of company A at the lower price
was set aside by the court even though the purchaser had paid for the shares. The accountant/
valuer had been asked to value the shares of company A but by mistake had valued the shares
of company B, which represented not merely an error in the valuation, but an error in terms
of his instructions.
If the other members do not wish to take up the shares, the shares may then be sold to an
outsider. The other members must apparently be prepared to take all the shares that the vendor
member is offering (Ocean Coal Co Ltdv Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co Ltd[1932] 1 Ch 654).
The right of pre-emption can, if appropriately worded, be enforced as between the members (Rayfieldv Hands[1960] Ch 1), and also by the company, which may obtain an injunction against a member who is not complying with the articles in this matter (Lyle & ScottLtd
v Scottâ€™s Trustees[1959] 2 All ER 661). The decision in Lyle & Scott Ltdcould make it very
difficult for a takeover bidder to take over a private company because if there is a preemption clause the board can ask the court for an injunction requiring a member to offer his
shares to another member rather than to the bidder.
Effect of transfer of equitable interest in shares
A method of effectively transferring control over the shares without triggering a pre-emption
clause can be seen in the following case.
Scottov Petch(2001) The Times, 8 February
The company owned Sedgefield racecourse, and an offer to buy all the shares in the company was
made by Northern Racing Ltd. Mrs Scotto, a 21 per cent shareholder, refused to sell. The other
shareholders were willing to do so. The victim company had a pre-emption clause in its articles
under which pre-emption rights in other shareholders were triggered if a shareholder â€˜intends to
transfer sharesâ€™. The shareholders other than Mrs Scotto made an agreement under which they
would remain on the register as legal owners of their shares but the equitable interest would belong
to Northern Racing. The agreement went on to say that if they were ever required to transfer the
legal interest, it would be to another member, i.e. it would be a permitted transfer under the article.
The arrangement gave Northern Racing effective control since under the agreement the shareholders, who were parties to it, would obviously vote as Northern Racing required. Mrs Scotto said
that the arrangement triggered the pre-emption clause so that the shares had to be offered to her.

Companies whose articles restrict transfer
Held - by the Court of Appeal - the pre-emption clause was not triggered. There had been no
transfer of the legal interest in the shares and if ever there was, it would be to other members and
would, therefore, be a permitted transfer under the articles.
Pre-emption: membersâ€™ waivers
The other members of the company may be prepared to give written waivers of their rights to
pre-emption, bearing in mind that a private company will normally have articles giving the
directors power to reject a transferee. However, where shares are transferred in breach of
a pre-emption clause without unanimous waiver of the other members, the directors have
no power to register the transfer and no question of discretion arises. A person wishing to sell
his shares in a private company with a pre-emption clause will normally notify the company
secretary, who will advise the other members of the wish to sell.
Rejection of transfers
Where the articles give the directors power simply to refuse or approve the registration of
transfers, that power must be exercised in good faith, and this may be tested in the courts if it
appears that the directors have rejected a transfer for purely personal reasons as where they
simply do not like the proposed transferee (and see Re Accidental Death Insurance Co, Allinâ€™s
Case, 1873, below); but where the power to reject is exercisable for reasons specified in the
articles, the transferee need not be told which is the reason for this rejection if the articles so
provide (see Berry and Stewartv Tottenham Hotspur FC, 1935, below). The position is the
same where the articles merely provide that the directors may reject a transfer â€˜without assigning reasons thereforâ€™. These provisions are much stronger because the directors cannot be
required to give reasons and therefore it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove before a court
that they acted in bad faith.
Re Accidental Death Insurance Co, Allinâ€™s Case(1873) LR 16 Eq 449
The companyâ€™s deed of settlement provided that when a shareholder wished to transfer his shares,
he should leave notice at the companyâ€™s office, and the directors should consider the proposal and
signify their acceptance or rejection of the proposed transferee. If they rejected the proposed
transferee, the proposed transfer would still be considered approved unless the directors could
find someone else to take the shares at market price. The company arranged to transfer its business to the Accident and Marine Insurance Corporation Ltd. The shareholders acquiesced in an
arrangement to exchange their shares for shares in the corporation, but the company was not
wound up. A year later, the former directors of the company reversed the procedure, and the company proposed to resume its former business. Notice of this was given to shareholders, and shortly
afterwards the corporation was wound up. Under an arrangement to release certain shareholders
of liability, Allin transferred 200 shares in the company to Robert Pocock for a nominal consideration. He gave notice to the directors at a meeting at which he was present, and the transfer was
agreed. Later the company was wound up.
Held - by the High Court - the transfer was invalid, and Allin must be a contributory. The clauses
were not intended to be in operation for the purpose of enabling individuals to escape liability when
the company had ceased to be a going concern.

Chapter 12 Shares - transfer and transmission
Berry and Stewartv Tottenham Hotspur FC Ltd[1935] Ch 718
Berry held one ordinary share in Tottenham Hotspur and he transferred his share to Stewart, both
of them subsequently trying to register the transfer. Registration was refused, and Art 16 of the
companyâ€™s articles specified four grounds on which this was allowable, and also stipulated that
the directors were not bound to divulge the grounds upon which registration was declined. The
claimants brought an action for a declaration that the company was not entitled to decline to
register the transfer, and sought interrogatories directed to find out which of the four grounds was
the basis of the refusal.
Held - by Crossman J - Article 16 excused the directors from the need to disclose this information, and this was binding not only on Berry, as a member, but also on Stewart who was applying
to be a member. An action coupled with a demand for interrogatories could not be used to oust
the agreement.
A more recent example of the use of this much stronger power of rejection is to be found in Popely
v Planarrive Ltd[1997] 1 BCLC 8. Article 14 of the articles of association of Planarrive Ltd (P Ltd),
a private company, gave its directors the power â€˜in their absolute discretion and without assigning
any reason thereforâ€™ to â€˜decline to register the transfer of a shareâ€™. If the directors took such an
action, they were required, under Art 25, to notify the transferee of their refusal to register his interest within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged. Darren Popely validly transferred 15 shares in P Ltd to his father Ronald. The directors of P Ltd exercised their powers under
Art 14 and refused to register the transfer. Ronald Popely then applied to the Chancery Division
under s 359 of the Companies Act 1985 for an order rectifying the register of members of P Ltd by
registering him as the owner of the shares transferred by his son. It was not disputed that notice
of the refusal to register had not been sent to Mr Popely within the time set out in Art 25. Counsel
for Mr Popely attempted to argue that this breach made the whole decision void. Mr Justice Laddie
said that it did not nullify the decision although it might expose the directors to some civil or criminal liability (see s 183(6)). With regard to the actual refusal to register the transfer, Mr Popelyâ€™s
counsel said that this refusal was based on the strong feelings of hostility felt by the directors
towards his client. However, the judge said that such feelings did not render the decision invalid.
Where directors have such w ide powers as these in the articles, the only restriction placed on them
was that they must act bona fide in the best interests of the company and not outside their powers.
Mr Popely was refused his application.
When is a transfer rejected?
Where there is an equality of votes, a transfer cannot be deemed rejected, but must be
accepted (see Re Hackney Pavilion Ltd, 1924, below), though it is usual for the chairman to
have a casting vote which he can use to decide the issue. Similarly, a transferee can ask the
court to rectify the register so that his name is included on it where one director, by refusing
to attend board meetings, is preventing a directorsâ€™ meeting from being held to consider the
registration because of lack of quorum (Re Copal Varnish Co, 1917). In addition, the powers
vested in directors to refuse to register a transfer must be exercised within a reasonable time
(see Re Swaledale Cleaners, 1968).

Companies whose articles restrict transfer
Re Hackney Pavilion Ltd[1924] 1 Ch 276
The company had three directors, Sunshine, Kramer and Rose, each of whom held 3,333 shares
in the company. Sunshine died, having appointed his widow as his executrix. Her solicitors wrote
to the company, enclosing a transfer of the 3,333 shares from herself as executrix to herself in an
individual capacity. At a board meeting at which Kramer, Rose and the secretary were present,
Rose proposed that the shares be registered, but Kramer objected in accordance with a provision
in the articles. There was no casting vote. The secretary then wrote to the solicitors informing them
that his directors had declined to register the transfer.
Held- by the High Court - the boardâ€™s right to decline required to be actively expressed. The mere
failure to pass the proposed resolution for registration was not a formal active exercise of the right
to decline. The right to registration remained, and the register must be rectified.
Unless the articles otherwise provide, rights of pre-emption and rejection apply only on a
transfer by a member, and do not arise on transmission through death or bankruptcy. Neither
do they arise where the shares are still represented by a renounceable letter of allotment.
Re Pool Shipping Ltd[1920] 1 Ch 251
The applicants were shareholders of the company which had capitalised Â£125,000, part of a
reserve fund, for distribution among the registered shareholders or their nominees, at the rate of
one share for every four shares issued. All but one of the shareholders renounced their right to
allotments, and requested the company to allot the shares to Coulson who had agreed to accept
them. The managers refused to issue the shares or register them to him when he presented the
letters of renunciation in his favour, so the applicants moved for rectification of the register by the
insertion of Coulsonâ€™s name. The company had no directors but was controlled by Sir R Ropner
& Co Ltd, who were described as managers and who relied on various clauses in the articles as
grounds for refusal.
Held - by the High Court - letters of renunciation do not amount to transfers of shares so as to
come within the provision s of the articles of association dealing with the transfer of shares already
registered. The managers were wrong in thinking they could refuse to register Mr Coulson, and the
register must be rectified.
Special articles may allow rejection of executorsâ€™ transfers to themselves as members pending
the winding-up of the estate as an alternative to dealing with them in a representative capacity, and where this is so, they will not be able to vote the deceasedâ€™s shares. A trustee in
bankruptcy in the same situation will at least be able to direct his living debtor on how to vote.
A restriction in a companyâ€™s articles upon the transfer of shares covers only the transfer of
the legal title, i.e. a transfer in the title of the person on the register of members, and does not
include transfer of the beneficial interest. Thus, if A and B are the only shareholders in a company and B has a majority holding, then if on the death of B his executor, C, who has obtained
registration, holds the shares on trust for beneficiaries, X and Y, and C proposes to vote in
accordance with the wishes of X and Y so that X and Y will control the company, then A cannot claim that there has been a transfer of the shares of B entitling A to the implementation
of a pre-emption clause under which A might require the shares held by C to be offered to
him (A) (see Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltdv National Westminster Bank[1982] 1 All

Chapter 12 Shares - transfer and transmission
Of course, if C had been refused registration under a provision in the companyâ€™s articles
allowing this, he could not vote and so the above situation would not apply.
Transmission of shares
This occurs where the rights encompassed in the holding of shares vests in another by operation of law and not by reason of transfer. It occurs in the following cases.
(a) Death of a shareholder
The shares of the deceased shareholder vest, in terms of the rights they represent, in executors
(or administrators if there is no will) who can sell or otherwise dispose of them, e.g. to a
beneficiary, without actually being registered, subject to any restrictions on transfer which the
articles may contain. CA 2006, s 774 provides that the company must accept probate of
the will, or in the case of administrators, letters of administration, as sufficient evidence of the
title of the personal representatives notwithstanding anything in its articles.
Personal representatives can insist on registration as members in respect of the deceasedâ€™s
shares unless the articles otherwise provide. Under Table A, Reg 30, the directors have the same
power to refuse to register personal representatives as they have to register transfers, provided
the shares are not fully paid, i.e. Reg 24 applies and they may refuse the transfer on the
grounds that the personal representative is a â€˜personâ€™ of whom they do not approve. The
company cannot insist that personal representatives be registered as members, but Reg 30 of
Table A allows them to elect to be registered subject to the above restriction. If they are
registered as members, they become personally liable for capital unpaid on the shares with
an indemnity from the estate, but they do receive the benefit of being able to vote the shares
at general and class meetings and to participate in written resolutions. Table A, Reg 31 excludes
voting rights unless personal representatives are registered. They receive all the benefits
attaching to the shares without registration except voting rights. Where, under the articles,
they are refused registration, they may now apply to the court for relief, e.g. an order to the
company to register them under CA 2006, s 994 on the grounds of unfair prejudice.
(b) Mental Health Act patients
Transmission also occurs to a receiver appointed by the Court of Protection to the estate of a
person becoming a patient under the Mental Health Act 1983. The authority of the receiver
is established by production of the protection order of the court appointing him. The position of the receiver is similar to that of personal representatives.
(c) Bankruptcy of a shareholder
On the bankruptcy of a member, the right to deal with the shares passes to the trustee in
bankruptcy, and he can sell them without actually being registered or he can elect to register
subject to any restrictions in the articles. Regulation 30 of Table A allows him to elect to
register. He would then be personally liable to pay any calls on the shares subject to a right of
indemnity against the estate. When the trustee sells the shares, the sale is effected by production to the company of the share certificate together with the Department of Trade and
Industryâ€™s certificate appointing the trustee and a transfer signed by him. A trustee cannot

Essay questions
vote unless he is registered but can direct the bankrupt on the way he must vote (Morganv
Gray[1953] 1 All ER 213).
A trustee in bankruptcy has a right of disclaimer under which he may disclaim shares as
onerous property where there are calls due on them and they would have little value if sold.
This power is given by s 315 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Disclaimer is effected by the trustee
serving upon the company a notice in writing disclaiming the shares, and he is then not personally liable to pay any calls if registered and the estate of the bankrupt member is no longer
liable as such. The company may claim damages, which in the case of shares of little value,
which was the reason for the disclaimer, are unlikely to be as much as the calls due but unpaid
(Re Hallet, ex parte NationalInsurance Co[1894] WN 156). Shares disclaimed may be reissued as paid up to the extent to which cash has been received on them. However, the company would have to ask the court for an order temporarily vesting the shares in the company
so that it could reissue them. Section 320 of the Insolvency Act 1986 applies. This is because
on disclaimer the shares vest in the Crown (Treasury Solicitor) as bona vacantia (property
without an owner). The situation is one of legal difficulty and doubt and legal advice would
have to be sought from a firm specialising in insolvency practice.
The shares, if trust property, are transferred to the trustees by the settlor (in a lifetime trust),
or by his personal representatives where the trust is by will. If new trustees or replacement
trustees are appointed once the trust has begun, the shares must be transferred to the new
trustees by the surviving former trustees in the usual way, i.e. by stock transfer form. There is
no transfer by operation of law on the appointment of the new trustee, nor under s 40 of the
Trustee Act 1925 where the trustee is appointed by deed.
Section 40 provides for the automatic transfer of property without a transfer or conveyance
to include a new trustee where his appointment is by deed. However, the section specifically
excludes company shares, which must be transferred into the joint names of the trustees
including the new one(s) in the ordinary way.

Shares - payment for and
insider dealing

The consideration - generally
In this chapter we shall deal with the methods of payment for shares and the rules which
apply according to the consideration offered, together with the rules relating to insider dealing. Companies Acts 2006, Chapter 5 to Part 17 is the applicable provisions that deal with
payment for shares.
The consideration - generally
A member of a company must pay for his shares in full, and no arrangement between the
company and the members can affect this rule (Ooregum Gold Mining Co of Indiav Roper
[1892] AC 125). However, payment need not be in cash but may be for some other consideration. Where this is so issues at a discount may still in effect be made in private companies.
CA 2006, s 580 requires that shares must not be allotted at a discount. CA 2006, s 581 considers provision for different amounts to be paid on shares.
Payment in cash
This is generally affected by handing cash or a cheque to the company, but if the company
pays an existing debt by an issue of shares to the creditor, this set-off arrangement is deemed
to be a payment in cash. CA 2006, s 582 provides that shares allotted by a company and any
premium on them may be paid up in money or moneyâ€™s worth (including goodwill and
know-how). CA 2006, s 583 provides the definition for payment in cash: a share in a company
is deemed paid up in cash, or allotted for cash, if the consideration received for the allotment
or payment up is a cash consideration.
Re Harmony and Montague Tin and Copper Mining Co, Spargoâ€™s Case
(1873) LR 8 Ch App 407
A company purchased a mine from Spargo and he made an agreement to buy shares in the company. The moneys owed by Spargo to the company for his shares and by the company to Spargo
for the mine were payable immediately. Under a further agreement between Spargo and the company, he was debited with the amount payable on the shares and credited with the purchase price
of the property making up the difference in cash. It was held by the Court of Appeal in Chancery
that Spargo must be deemed to have paid for his shares in cash.
The provisions of the Companies Act relating to an issue of shares for a non-cash consideration
seem not to apply to set-offs of this kind which are regarded as cash transactions. Section 739
provides, in effect, that the issue of shares to satisfy a liquidated sum, i.e. an existing quantified
debt, as in this case, is not an issue for a consideration other than cash.
Considerations other than cash
(a) In private companies
Such considerations are legal, and the consideration very often consists in the sale of property
to the company or the rendering of services. The consideration offered must be sufficient to

Chapter 13 Shares - payment for and insider dealing
support the contract in law and must not, for example, be past, though in private companies,
at least, it need not be adequate.
Re Eddystone Marine Insurance Co[1893] 3 Ch 9
The company proposed to raise capital from the public, but passed a resolution before going to
the public to allot Â£6,000 worth of fully paid shares to the existing directors and shareholders for
a consideration other than cash. A copy of the agreement was filed in which the consideration was
said to be services rendered by the allottees to the company during its formation. There was in
fact no such rendering of services. Eighteen months later the company was wound up, and the
liquidator proposed to regard the shares as unpaid on the grounds that there was no consideration given for them.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - the allottees must contribute the nominal value of the shares. There
was in fact no consideration because the services had not been rendered, but even if they had,
they would not have supported the contract to take the shares because the consideration would
have been past.
CA 2006, s 585 provides that a public company shall not accept at any time in payment up of its
shares or any premium on them, an undertaking given by any person that he or another should do
work or perform services for the company or any other person. If shares are issued for services by
a public company the holder is liable to pay the nominal value and any premium to the company
plus interest set by the authorities pursuant to CA 2006, s 592. This applies whether the services
are rendered or not. If services are rendered the person who renders them must pay for his shares
and submit an account for the services.
Re Wragg Ltd[1897] 1 Ch 796
Messrs Wragg and Martin w ere the proprietors of a livery stable business and they agreed to sell
it to a company, Wragg Ltd, which they formed. The business was sold to the company for
Â£46,300, among the assets being horses and carriages valued for the purposes of the sale at
Â£27,000. The company paid for the business by issuing shares and debentures to Wragg and
Martin, and later, when the company was being wound up, the liquidator asked the court to declare
that the shares were not fully paid up because it appeared that the horses and carriages had been
overvalued and were really worth only Â£15,000 at the date of sale.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that:
(a) Where fully paid shares are allotted to vendors under a contract registered in accordance with
the Companies Acts, it is not illegal for the said vendors or promoters to make a profit, though
disclosure is required. In this case disclosure did not arise, since Wragg and Martin and certain nominees of theirs became the only shareholders in Wragg Ltd, and they were aware of
the details of the transaction.
(b) The court will not go behind a contract of this sort and enquire into the adequacy of the consideration unless the consideration appears on the face of the contract to be insufficient or
illusory. This was not the case here for if the company had received advice on the purchase of
the business, some advisers might have thought that, looking at the business as a whole, it was
a good bargain at Â£46,300.

The consideration - generally
(c) Where persons, as vendors, make an agreement with themselves and their nominees in the
character of a limited company it is, following Salomon vSalomon & Co, 1897, an agreement
between independent legal entities and is valid.
The CA 2006, s 585 places restrictions on public companies in regard to the allotment of shares
for a non-cash consideration by requiring, among other things, a valuation of that consideration.
However, in private companies the companyâ€™s valuation of the consideration will still be accepted
as conclusive in the absence of, for example, fraud.
It should be noted, however, that the court will enquire into the agreement where the
consideration does not really exist.
Hong Kong & China Gas Co Ltdv Glen[1914] 1 Ch 527
The company agreed that in return for a concession to supply gas to the city of Victoria, Hong
Kong, it would allot the vendor of the concession 400 shares of Â£10 each, fully paid; and it further
agreed that if and when it increased its capital in the future, the vendor or his executors, administrators or assigns should have as fully paid, one-fifth of the increased capital. In this action the
company asked the court to decide whether the part of the agreement relating to the one-fifth
share of any increase in the capital of the company was binding.
Held- by the High Court - it was not. The insufficiency of the consideration appeared on the face
of the contract, for the company had agreed to give at any future time or times a wholly indefinite
and possibly unlimited value for the purchase of the concession.
An agreement to allot shares for future services, even in a private company, may mean that
the allottee will become liable to pay for the shares in full, since if he does not render the
services, the company would otherwise be reduced to a mere action for damages, and would
not have an action for the actual price of the shares, and it is doubtful whether a company can
replace the liability of a member to pay for his shares in full with a mere action for damages
(Gardnerv Iredale[1912] 1 Ch 700).
Where shares are issued for a consideration other than cash, the contract, or if the contract
is not in writing written particulars of it, must be sent to the Registrar for registration within
one month of the allotment of the shares. If there is no such registration within the time
prescribed, the officers of the company are liable to a fine under the CA 2006, s 590, but the
allotment is not affected. It should be noted that mere registration of a contract will not make
it binding on the company if there is no consideration for it (Re Eddystone Marine Insurance
Co, 1893, see above).
(b) In public companies
Under s 587 of the CA 2006 a public company is only allowed to allot shares as fully or partly
paid by an undertaking to transfer a non-cash asset to the company if the transfer is to take
place within five years of the date of the allotment.
In addition, under CA 2006, s 593 an allotment for a non-cash consideration is not to
be made unless the non-cash asset has been valued by an independent accountant who
would be qualified to be the auditor of the company (or by someone else approved by that
independent accountant). In addition, the independent accountant must have reported to

Independent Accountantsâ€™ Report issued in accordance with s 597 of the Companies
Act 2006 to Dove plc
As required by s 597 of the Companies Act 2006, we report on the valuation of the
consideration for the allotment to H Hawke of two hundred thousand shares of a nominal
value of one pound issued at a premium of 50 pence per share. The shares and the share
premium are to be treated as fully paid up.
The consideration given by H Hawke is freehold building land situated at Meadow Drift,
Chelmsford, Essex. The land was valued on the basis of its open market value by
R Robin, FRICS, on 1 December 2004, and, in our opinion, it is reasonable to accept
that valuation. In our opinion, the method of valuation of the freehold building land was
reasonable and there appears to have been no material change in the value since it was
made. On the basis of this valuation, in our opinion, the value of the consideration is not
less than Â£300,000.

the company on his valuation during the six months prior to the allotment, and must state
that the value of the consideration is at least equal to the value of the shares being allotted.
A copy of the report must also have been sent to the allottee and filed at the Companies
Registry with the return of allotments (CA 2006, s 597). A typical report to satisfy s 597
appears in Figure 13.1.
A valuation of the kind set out above is not required in a share exchange as in a takeover
bid where Predator is acquiring Victim by exchanging Predator shares for Victim shares so
that the consideration for Predator shares is the assets of Victim, but all the holders of shares
in Victim must be able to take part in the arrangement (CA 2006, s 593). The valuation is not
a mere formality since failure to obtain a valuation when shares in a plc are allotted for a noncash consideration introdu ces the rather startling provisions of CA 2006, s 606, i.e. that the
recipient of the shares must pay for them. This is in the nature of a penalty and there are no
provisions in the Act for recovery of the property. This result can be mitigated under s 606(1)
which allows the recipient to apply to the court for exemption.
An exemption was granted in Re Ossory Estates plc [1988] BCLC 213 where shares were
issued for a non-cash consideration, i.e. property, without an accountantâ€™s valuation. However, there was evidence before the court that the company had sold some of the properties at
a profit. This suggested that they were at least as valuable as the shares issued for them and the
recipient of the shares was excused from paying the cash penalty.
Under CA 2006, s 598 for two years following the date of issue of the certificate that a company registered as a public company is entitled to commence business, the company may not
acquire assets from subscribers to the memorandum having an aggregate value equal to 10 per
cent or more of the nominal value of the issued share capital unless:
(a) the valuation rules set out above are complied with; and
(b) the acquisition of the asset(s) and the terms of the acquisition have been approved by
an ordinary resolution of the company. A copy of that resolution must be filed at the
Companies Registry within 15 days of its passing.

Prohibition on allotment of shares at a discount
The report under CA 2006, s 600 is similar to that under CA 2006, s 601 except that the
consideration need not be shares and approval in general meeting is required.
Similar rules apply on re-registration as a public company where non-cash assets equal to
at least 10 per cent of the nominal value of the issued share capital at that time are acquired
from persons who are members of the company at the time of re-registration. These provisions do not apply to assets acquired in the ordinary course of business.
In addition, under CA 2006, s 584, the shares which a subscriber of the memorandum of a
public company agrees in the memorandum to take must be paid up in cash, and under CA
2006, s 585 a public company must not accept at any time in payment up of its shares or any
premium on them, an undertaking given by any person that he or another should do work or
perform services in the future for the company or any other person.
Where the above requirements are contravened, CA 2006, s 587 provides that the allottee
and his successors, but not purchasers for value without notice, will be liable to pay to the
company the amount outstanding in respect of the allotment with interest which is currently
5 per cent per annum. The company and any officer in default may also be liable to a fine.
However, as we have seen, the court may grant relief where the applicant has acted in good
faith and it is just and equitable to grant relief.
Prohibition on allotment of shares at a discount
Companies Acts 2006, s 580 prohibits the issue of shares at a discount, though, as we have
seen, this may happen in private companies where there is a non-cash consideration for the
reason that the directorsâ€™ valuation is accepted, so that there is in law no issue at a discount.
A private company that issued shares for cash at a discount would be acting illegally. The
power to pay underwriting commission under CA 2006, s 552 is not affected. Where shares
are allotted in contravention of CA 2006, s 580 those shares shall be treated as paid up by the
payment to the company of the amount of the nominal value of the shares less the amount of
the discount, but the allo ttee shall be liable to pay the company the latter amount and shall be
liable to pay interest thereon at the appropriate rate which is currently 5 per cent per annum
(s 592). Persons who take the shares from the original allottee are jointly and severally liable
with the original allottee to pay the amount mentioned above unless they are purchasers
for value, and even a purchaser for value may be liable if he has actual knowledge of the contravention of s 588 at the time of the purchase.
Debentures may be issued at a discount, though where there is a right to exchange the
debentures for shares at par value the debentures are good but the right to exchange is void.
Moselyv Koffyfontein Mines Ltd[1904] 2 Ch 108
The company proposed to issue to its shareholders certain debentures at a discount of 20 per
cent, the debentures to be repayable by the company on 1 November 1909. The debenture holders
were to have the right at any time prior to 1 May 1909, to exchange the debentures for fully
paid shares in the company on the basis of one fully paid share of Â£1 nominal value for every Â£1
of nominal value of debentures held. The court was asked in this case to decide whether the
proposed issue of debentures was void.

Chapter 13 Shares - payment for and insider dealing
Held - by the Court of Appeal - it was void, because the exchange of debentures for fully paid
shares would lead to the issue of shares at a discount whenever the right was exercised.
Issue of shares at a discount was permitted prior to the Companies Act 1980, but only if, amongst
other things, there had been an ordinary resolution of the members, together with the permission
of the court. Issue at a discount is now forbidden by CA 2006, s 552.
Shares issued at a premium
Share premiums: generally
There is nothing to prevent a company issuing shares at a premium, e.g. Â£1 shares at a price
of Â£1.25p; and, indeed, where it is desired to issue further shares, of a class already dealt in
on the Stock Exchange at a substantial premium, it is a practical necessity to do so except
perhaps in a rights issue.
However, CA 2006, s 610 requires that such premium must be credited to a â€˜share
premium accountâ€™ to be treated as capital except in so far as it may be written down to pay
up fully paid bonus shares, to write off preliminary expenses, commissions and discounts in
respect of new issues, and to provide any premium on the redemption of any debentures.
It may also be used in a very restricted way to charge the premium on redemption of shares
if this premium has been paid out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the
The above rules prevent such premiums which are capital by nature from being paid away
as dividends. Any balance on the share premium account must be shown in the balance sheet.
Section 610 in fact recognises that the real capital of a company is the price which subscribers pay for its shares and not the somewhat artificial nominal value. This results, in effect,
in an admission that shares are really of no par value. If no par value shares were issued, the
capital of the company would simply be the total paid for its shares by subscribers. This is
known in the United States as the companyâ€™s paid-in capital. Where the whole of the issued
price has not been paid, the total amount paid plus the total amount remaining to be paid is
in the United States called the companyâ€™s stated capital.
If it were possible to issue no par shares in England, the accidental payment of dividends
out of capital would automatically be precluded by the companyâ€™s obligation to keep in hand
assets worth at least the amount paid by subscribers plus the amount of the companyâ€™s outstanding debts. However, until no par value shares are allowed, the law can ensure that the
issue price of the shares is not dissipated in paying dividends only by using the somewhat
inelegant device of the share premium account.
The Companies Act 2006 requires share premiums to be credited to a share premium
account whether the shares are issued for cash or otherwise. In consequence, the Act always
applies whether premiums are paid in cash or kind and so if a company issues shares for
a consideration in kind which is worth more than the nominal value of the shares, a sum
equal to the excess value of the consideration has to be transferred to a share premium

Shares issued at a premium
Henry Head & Co Ltdv Ropner Holdings Ltd[1952] Ch 124
Ropner Holdings was formed as a holding company, its main object being to acquire the whole of
the issued share capital of the Pool Shipping Co Ltd and the Ropner Shipping Co Ltd for the purposes of amalgamation. Ropner Holdings issued the whole of its authorised capital of Â£1,759,606
(this being equal to the sum of the issued capitals of the two shipping companies) to the shareholders of Pool Shipping and Ropner Shipping on the basis of Â£1 share for each Â£1 share held
in the two shipping companies. The value of the assets of the two shipping companies, when
Ropner Holdings acquired the shares, was Â£6,830,972, and the difference between this figure and
Â£1,759,606, less formation expenses, was shown on the balance sheet of Ropner Holdings as
â€˜Capital Reserve - Share Premium Accountâ€™ so as to comply with the Companies Act 1948. The
claimants, who were large shareholders in Ropner Holdings, asked that the company be required
to treat the reserve as a general and not a capital reserve because otherwise no payment out of
the reserve could be made unless the procedure for reduction of capital was followed.
Held - by Harman J - Ropner Holdings had, in effect, issued its shares at a premium within the
meaning of what is now s 130, and was bound to retain the reserve as a capital reserve.
The case is still authority for the statement that a share premium account must be raised even
where the consideration is not cash. However, in the circumstances of the case merger relief would
presumably have been available.
Share premiums - acquisitions, mergers and group
reconstructions
Companies Acts 2006, ss 611-615 give relief, in certain circumstances, from the requirement
to set up a share premium account under s 610.
Acquisitions and mergers
(a) Acquisitions. This involves a takeover where the predator company P makes an offer to
the shareholders of the V ictim company V either with or without the consent of the board of
V. The price offered is usually above the market price. If V is acquired, i.e. if there are
sufficient acceptances from the shareholders of V, the investment of P in V must be shown in
the books of P at its true value, i.e. the value of the consideration given. This has the effect
of treating the reserves of V as pre-acquisition and therefore as undistributable and in
particular pre-acquisition profits are locked up.
This position is unchanged by the CA 2006 and pre-acquisition profits must be locked up
because if V pays a dividend to P out of pre-acquisition profits and P uses it to pay dividend
to its shareholders P is returning the capital it used for the purchase of Vâ€™s shares to its
members because the pre-acquisition profits were represented in the price which P paid for
Vâ€™s shares.
(b) Mergers. In the case of a merger between P and V involving a share-for-share exchange,
e.g. P issues its equity shares to the members of V on a one-for-one basis, in exchange for the
shares of the members of V, as a result of which P becomes the holder of 90 per cent or more
of the equity shares of V, then there is no need to value the investment in V at its true value.
The value may simply be the nominal value of the shares exchanged and so no share premium

Chapter 13 Shares - payment for and insider dealing
account is created as was the case in Henry Headunder the old law (see above). Thus, the reserves of V need not be treated as pre-acquisition and pre-acquisition profits are not locked up.
Section 613 sets out the minimum conditions which must be met before a company can
use the merger method of accounting. The conditions are:
1 The parent company must acquire at least 90 per cent by nominal value of relevant shares
in the target company. This is then a genuine â€˜pooling of assetsâ€™. Relevant shares are shares
carrying unrestricted rights to participate both in distributions and in the assets of the
undertaking on liquidation.
2 The 90 per cent must be achieved under an arrangement for the issue of shares by the
parent company, i.e. merger accounting is appropriate only where there is substantially a
share-for-share exchange. It is permissible to have a prior holding but the 2006 Act does
not restrict its size.
3 The issue of equity shares must be the dominant element in the consideration offered by
the parent company for the relevant shares in the company to be acquired. The fair value
of the consideration which may be given in a form other than equity shares is limited to
10 per cent of the nominal value of the equity shares issued.
4 Finally, merger accounting is not available as of right even if (1)-(3) are satisfied but only
where its use accords with generally accepted accounting principles and practice.
Students who are also taking accounting courses will appreciate that this area of the law is
subject to Accounting Standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board. It would not be
appropriate to deal with these here and an examination in company law would not require
knowledge of them. They would normally be examined in accounting papers.
However some of them are so important that they have a major effect on statutory provisions and must be noted in outline here. Corporate mergers will in regard to business combinations agreed on or after 31 March 2004 always be treated as if one party is buying the
other (an acquisition) under amendments to International Accounting Standard 36 issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board. As already noted merger accounting enables
the enlarged group to take a full year of profits from both companies. Under the amended IAS
36, companies will have to treat mergers as takeovers so the enlarged organisation can only
count profits since the date of acquisition (acquisition accounting).
The need to write down goodwill following a takeover is abolished. In future all goodwill
is to be valued according to the profits that are actually earned from the business and projected to be earned in the future.
Group reconstructions
Companies Acts 2006, s 611 provides limited relief in the case of certain group reconstructions. The reconstructions to which the CA 2006 applies are those where the transactions are
as follows:
(a) a wholly-owned subsidiary (the issuing company) has allotted some of its shares either to
its holding company or to another wholly-owned subsidiary of its holding company;
(b) the allotment is a consideration for the transfer to it of shares or any non-cash assets in
another subsidiary of the holding company. This other subsidiary need not necessarily be
wholly owned.
The purposes of reconstruction and the variety of changes that can be achieved by the use
of the reconstruction sections of the CA 2006 are further described in Chapter 24.

Insider dealing
However, let us assume that our holding company (H) holds 100 per cent of the shares
in company A and 75 per cent of the shares in company B. A allots 1,000 Â£1 ordinary shares
(valued at Â£6 per share) to H; in return H transfers its 75 per cent holding in B to A. If there
was no relief in this situation, A would have had to raise a share premium account in its
books. However, under s 611(2) A need only transfer to a share premium account an amount
equal to the â€˜minimum premium valueâ€™.
This is the amount, if any, by which the base value of the shares in the subsidiary (B)
exceeds the aggregate nominal value of the shares that the issuing company (A) allotted in
consideration for the transfer.
Base value is the lower of
(a) the cost to the holding company (H) of the shares in B;
(b) the amount at which the shares of B were stated immediately prior to this transfer in the
accounting records of H.
Thus, if in our example the shares in B cost Â£4,000 but are standing in the accounting
records of H at Â£3,000 the base value is Â£3,000. The nominal value of the shares allotted by A
is Â£1,000 so the minimum premium value is Â£2,000 and this must be transferred to Aâ€™s share
premium account, but not, of course, the true value of the consideration it received from B
by allotting 1,000 shares to H.
Finally, it should be noted that the CA 2006 imposes no obligation on a company to issue
its shares at a premium when a premium could be obtained. Consequently, the issue of shares
at par is valid even though a premium could have been obtained (Hilderv Dexter[1902] AC
474) but directors who fail to require subscribers to pay a premium which could have been
obtained are guilty of breach of duty to the company and will be liable to pay the premium
themselves as damages (Lowry v Consolidated African Selection Trust Ltd [1940] 2 All ER
545). Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to this ruling. For example, directors may issue
shares at a price below their market value to existing shareholders in pursuance of a rights
offer made to all the shareholders of the company, or to all the ordinary shareholders in
proportion to the nominal values of their existing holdings. The reason for this is that all the
shareholders concerned can avail themselves of the offer and if they do none of them will
suffer a diminution of their percentage interest in the net assets or earnings of the company
and consequently none of them will be harmed.
Insider dealing
Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 applies and Sch 2 to that Act sets out the securities
covered by its provisions. It is not necessary at this level to list all of these, but obviously
shares issued by companies are covered, and the prosecutions that have been brought under
the insider-dealing rules, which are very few, have been concerned with dealings in company shares. However, the 1993 Act also covers gilts, which are interest-bearing securities
as distinct from shares which pay a dividend, and where insider dealing could consist of
dealing in such securities with inside information as to changes in interest rates either up
The securities must also be listed on a regulated market such as the Stock Exchange, but
dealing in differences is covered too. Those who deal in differences do not buy shares or even

Chapter 13 Shares - payment for and insider dealing
take an option on them. The deal consists of a forecast of the price of a particular security at
a given future time, and those who enter into such deals with inside information which helps
them better to predict the price will commit an offence.
The Act does not apply to unlisted securities or face-to-face transactions, so that cases such
âž¨ See p. 385 as Percivalv Wright, 1902 (see Chapter 19 âž¨) are unaltered on their own facts.
Meaning of dealing
A person deals in securities if he acquires or disposes of the securities himself, whether for
himself or as the agent of some other person, orprocures an acquisition or a disposal of the
securities by someone else. Therefore, A could acquire shares for himself, or acquire shares as
a broker for his client or dispose of them in the same contexts. Alternatively, A may simply
advise B to purchase or dispose of shares and still be potentially liable if he has inside information. B may also be liable in this situation if he is a tippee (see below).
What is inside information?
Basically, this is information which relates to the securities themselves or to the state of the
company which issued them. It must be specific and precise so that general information about
a company, e.g. that it was desirous of moving into the field of supermarkets, would not be
enough. In addition the information must not have been made public and must be the sort
of information which, if it had been made public, would be likely to have had a significant
effect on the price of those securities, e.g. falling or rising profits or decisions to pay a higher
dividend than expected, or a lower one or no dividend at all.
In order to be guilty of the offence of insider dealing, the individual concerned must be an
insider. A person has information as an insider if:
â— the information which he has is and he knows it is â€˜insider informationâ€™;
â— he has the information and he knows that he has it from an â€˜inside sourceâ€™.
A person is in possession of information from an â€˜inside sourceâ€™ if:
â— he has the information through being a director, employee or shareholder of a company or
by having access to it by reason of his employment, e.g. as auditor; or
â— the source of the information is a person within the above categories.
So A is a director of Boxo plc. He has inside information that Boxoâ€™s profits when
announced in ten daysâ€™ time will be up (or down). He buys (or sells) Boxo shares himself and
is potentially liable. He advises his friend Fred to buy (or sell) Boxo shares but does not tell
him why. A is potentially liable but Fred is not - he does not have the inside information.
If A tells Fred about the future profit announcement and then Fred deals, Fred is potentially
liable, as is A. If Fred advises his son to buy (or sell) Boxo shares but does not tell him why,
A and Fred are potentially liable but Fredâ€™s son is not. If Fred gives his son the inside information and the son deals, then A and Fred and Fredâ€™s son are potentially liable.

Market abuse
Disclosure in the course of employment
Sometimes it is necessary for a person to pass on inside information as part of his employment, as may be the case with an audit manager who passes on inside information to a senior
partner of the firm who is in charge of the audit. If the senior partner deals he will be potentially liable, but the audit manager will not since the 1993 Act exempts such persons.
Necessity for intent
Since insider dealing is a crime, it requires, as most but not all crimes do, an intention to see
a dealing take place to secure a profit or prevent a loss. It is unlikely that an examiner would
go deeply into what is essentially the field of the criminal lawyer, but consider this example:
Aâ€™s son was at college and broke. He asked his father for a loan and his father said, â€˜Look, son,
youâ€™re not getting any more money from me - pity you cannot buy some shares in Boxo plc
of which I am a director. Next monthâ€™s profit announcement will be way up on last yearâ€™s.
You could make a killing.â€™ If for some reason Aâ€™s son was able to scrape up sufficient funds to
buy shares in Boxo plc, it is unlikely that his father would be liable because he had no idea that
his son would be in a position to buy the shares.
Penalty for insider dealing
The contract is unaffected as in Percival v Wright, 1902. The sanctions are criminal, the
maximum sentence being seven yearsâ€™ imprisonment and/or a fine of unlimited amount. In
order to be found guilty, the offence must in general terms be committed while the person
concerned was in the UK or the trading market was.
Exemptions
Schedule 2 to the Criminal Justice Act 1993 sets out in particular an exemption for persons
operating as market makers, so that, for example, those engaged in making a market for
shares on the Stock Exchange are exempt because they would find it difficult to operate markets in shares if they had to stop dealing in them when in possession of what might be inside
information about some of them. It should be noted, however, that the exemption covers only
the offence of dealing. They are not exempt from the offence of encouraging another to deal.
Market abuse
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 introduces the concept of market abuse. Under
the relevant provisions, the Financial Services Authority has power to reprimand publicly or
impose an unlimited fine on authorised and unauthorised persons for engaging in market
abuse. The Financial Services Authority is the sole regulator for the financial services industry and has the power to authorise persons and organisations to operate in it. Its power
extends to non-authorised persons and this would include members of professions such as
lawyers and accountants who are, for example, authorised by their own professional bodies to

Chapter 13 Shares - payment for and insider dealing
give advice incidentally to the practise of their profession, as where an accountant gives a
client advice on investments as part of a tax-planning arrangement. Such persons are not
authorised by the FSA unless investment advice is their main line of business and yet are
covered by the market-abuse rules. Indirect market abuse is covered as where a person requires
or encourages another to engage in behaviour that if done by the defendant would amount to
market abuse (s 123(1) and (3)).
Market abuse defined
Section 118(1) defines market abuse as:
â— behaviour in relation to any qualifying investments;
â— likely to be regarded by regular users of the market as falling below the standard reasonably expected of a person in that position; and
â— that falls within at least one of three categories (see below).
In general terms, the behaviour will be in a UK investment market, such as the London
Stock Exchange. The regular-user concept is hypothetical and is defined as â€˜a reasonable
person who regularly deals on the market in investments of the kind in questionâ€™ (s 118(10)).
The behaviour referred to is set out in s 118(2) as:
â— based on information not generally available to users of the market which, if available to a
regular user, would be likely to be regarded by him as relevant in regard to the terms on
which to deal in those investments. In other words, insider information;
â— likely to give a regular user a false or misleading impression as to the market value of such
investments. In other words, misleading statements and practices; or
â— regarded by a regular user as likely to distort the market in such investments. In other
words, rigging the market, as where a company makes funds available to a person so that he
can buy its shares in order to raise the market price by increased demand so that the shares
will be more acceptable as part of takeover consideration by an exchange of shares.
There is a major defence that the person concerned exercised all due diligence to avoid
market abuse, and there is a â€˜safe havenâ€™ where the Takeover Panel has ruled that the dealing
may go ahead, as where a person with inside knowledge deals as part of a rescue operation to
save the company concerned.
The market code
The FSMA gives only a broad definition of abuse but the FSA has drawn up, as the Act
requires, a Code of Market Conduct to help particularise abuse. For example, the Code mentions persons using Internet bulletin boards to post misleading information and journalists
using inside knowledge to trade in shares.
Burden of proof
Unlike the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1993, which are obviously criminal in nature
and where proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required (this being the cause of its failure to
provide convictions in many cases), the FSA operates under a civil regimeso that abuse need
be proved only on a balance of probabilities. However, because the proceedings might be

Model Code for Securities Transactions by directors of listed companies
viewed as criminal in nature under the Convention on Human Rights, the government has
excluded the admission of compelled evidence emanating, for example, from a BIS inspection. It has also granted safe harbours and a due diligence defence under the Code and made
some legal aid available (ss 114(8), 122, 123(2), 134-136 and 174(2)).
Injunctions and restitution
In order not to disturb the proper working of the market when the FSA imposes a fine, the
transaction is not made void or unenforceable. However, for any form of market abuse or
misconduct, the FSA can seek to prevent anticipated abuse by a court injunction and ask the
court for a restitution order on behalf of victims of abuse to make up their loss. There are
defences of reasonable belief and due diligence (ss 382(1) and (8); 383(1), (3) and (10); and
384(1) and (6)).
Position of the Criminal Justice Act 1993
This measure is not repealed and continues to be available for the pursuit of criminal
prosecutions.
Model Code for Securities Transactions by directors of
listed companies
The Financial Services Authority set up a Model Code for Securities Transactions, to give
guidance as to when it is proper for directors of listed companies to deal in the securities
of the company. The Code received widespread acceptance and is part of the Listing Rules.
The main principles of the Code are:
(a) Directors should not engage in short-term dealings, e.g. purchases and sales over short
periods, because it is difficult to avoid the suggestion that such dealing is based on inside
knowledge.
(b) Directors should not deal for a minimum period prior to the announcement of reports
and results. Where results are announced half-yearly, the closed period for dealings should
be the previous two months but, if announcements are more frequent, e.g. quarterly, the
period is one month immediately preceding the announcement of the quarterly results.
Directors should not deal either when an exceptional announcement is to be made
which would probably affect the market price of the companyâ€™s shares, or when they are
in possession of knowledge which when accessible to the public will affect the market
price of the shares.
(c) A director must obtain clearance from the chairman (or other designated director) before
dealing. The chairman must obtain clearance either from the board or the designated
director before dealing. Clearance must not be given in a closed period.
(d) A written record of dealings should be kept by the company and the board as a whole
should see that directors comply with a practice to be established within the company on
the above lines. In this respect a director should ensure that where he is a beneficiary
under a trust, the trustees notify him after dealing so that it can be recorded. In addition,
a director must return dealings of a spouse or for minor children.

Chapter 13 Shares - payment for and insider dealing
The above rules apply also to â€˜relevant employeesâ€™, i.e. those whose work within the company may cause them to be in possession of price-sensitive information in regard to its
securities and to dealings by a directorâ€™s â€˜connectedâ€™ person, e.g. a spouse.
Full details of the Model Code appear in the Listing Rules (the â€˜Purple Bookâ€™) as an
appendix to Chapter 16 of those rules.

Membership - capacity, registration,
director and substantial holdings,
annual return

Chapter 14 Membership - capacity, registration, director and substantial holdings, annual return
There are several ways in which membership of a company may be acquired. These are
as follows:
(a) By subscribing the memorandum. When the company is registered, the persons who subscribed the memorandum automatically become members on subscription, and must
be put on the register of members on registration of the company (s 112(1), Companies
Act 2006).
(b) By making an applicationon the basis of listing particulars or a prospectus for an allotment of shares.
(c) By taking a transferfrom an existing member.
(d) By succeeding to shares on the death or bankruptcy of a member.
The persons mentioned in (b), (c) and (d) above do not actually become members until
their names are entered in the register of members. In this regard CA 2006, s 122(2) states that
every other person who agrees to become a member of a company, and whose name is entered
in its register of members, is a member of the company.
The question of capacity is governed by the general law of contract, and anyone who has the
capacity to make a contract may become a member of a company. The contracts of minors
are governed by rules of the common law some of which have been enacted, e.g. in the Sale
of Goods Act 1979 as amended by the Minorâ€™s Contracts Act 1987. The position as regards
company membership appears below.
A minor may be a member of a company unless the articles otherwise provide. Registration of a minor may give rise to difficulties in the case of partly paid shares or unlimited
companies, because a minor can repudiate the contract with the company at any time during
minority and for a reasonable time thereafter. If he does repudiate, he cannot recover the
money he has paid up to the time of repudiation if the shares have ever had any value.
Steinbergv Scala (Leeds) Ltd[1923] 2 Ch 452
The claimant, Miss Steinberg, purchased shares in the defendant company and paid certain sums
of money on application, on allotment and on one call. Being unable to meet future calls, she repudiated the contract while still a minor and claimed:
(a) rectification of the register of members to remove her name therefrom, thus relieving her from
liability on future calls; and
(b) the recovery of the money already paid.
The company agreed to rectify the register and issue was joined on the claim to recover the
money paid.
Held- the claim under (b) above failed because there had not been total failure of consideration.
The shares had some value and gave some rights even though the claimant had not received any
dividends and the shares had always stood at a discount on the market.

The register of members
The Family Law Reform Act 1969, s 1 reduced the age of majority from 21 to 18 years.
There is a general provision in the Act that a person attains a particular age, i.e. not only the
age of majority, on the first moment of the relevant birthday.
A company always has power to refuse to accept a minor as a transferee or shareholder
where it knows his age and can probably set aside a transfer to a minor once it learns the
position (Re Contract Corporation, Goochâ€™s Case (1872) LR 8 Ch App 266). However, if a
company registers a minor knowing him to be such it cannot afterwards repudiate him.
The register of members
Section 113(1) requires every company to keep a register of its members. The register must
contain the following information:
(a) the names and addresses of the members (s 113(2)(a));
(b) the date on which each person was entered in the register as a member (s 113(2)(b));
(c) the date on which each person ceased to be a member (s 113(2)(c)).
Section 113(3) goes on to state that in the case of a company having a share capital there must
be entered in the register, with the names and addresses of the members, a statement of:
(a) the shares held by each member, distinguishing each share
(i) by its number if it has one; and
(ii) where the company has more than one class of issued shares, by its class, and
(b) the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid up on the shares of each member
(s 113(3)(b)).
Section 113(4) states that if the company has converted any of its shares into stock, and
given notice of the conversion to the registrar, the register of members must show the amount
and class of stock held by each member instead of the amount of shares and the particulars
relating to shares.
In the event of joint holders of shares or stock in a company, the companyâ€™s register of
members must, according to s 113(5), state the names of each joint holder.
Failure to keep a register of members renders the company and every officer in default liable
to a fine and also to a daily fine for each day during which the default continues (s 113(7)(8)).
The register may be kept in any form, e.g. in the form of a loose leaf system, so long as
proper precautions are taken to guard against falsification. The 2006 Act allows the use of
computers for company records, including the register of members, so long as the records can
be reproduced in legible form. According to s 115, a company with more than 50 members
must keep an index of its members, and if there is any alteration in the register, the index
must also be altered within 14 days of such alteration (s 115(2)). The above provisions do
not apply if the register is kept in the form of an index (s 115(1)). Section 115(4) outlines the
fact that the index must be at all times kept available for inspection at the same place as the
register of members.
Section 114(1)(a) states that the register and index must be kept available for inspection at
the registered office of the company, or at a place specified in regulations under s 113(6) of
the CA 2006. Section 114(2) goes on to note that a company must give notice to the Registrar
of the whereabouts of the register and of any changes in that place. If a company makes

Chapter 14 Membership - capacity, registration, director and substantial holdings, annual return
default for 14 days in complying with this requirement, then s 114(5) states that an offence is
committed by the company and every officer of the company who is in default. However,
s 114(3) states that no such notice is required if the register has, at all times since it came into
existence, been kept available for inspection at the companyâ€™s registered office.
Inspection of register
During business hours the register and the index must under s 116 of the CA 2006 be kept
open for inspection by any member free of charge (s 116(1)(a)), and by any other person on
payment of a fee (s 116(1)(b)). Under s 116(2), the company must make available either to a
member or to any other person a copy of any part of the register, and may make a charge for
this. The company must either send the copy (s 117(1)(a)) or apply to the court (s 117(1)(b))
within five days of receiving a s 116 request.
If a company makes an application to the court and the court is satisfied that the inspection
or copy is not sought for a proper purposes, then it shall direct the company not to comply with
the request (s 117(3)(a)), and it may order that the companyâ€™s costs on the application be paid
in whole or in part by the person who made the request (s 117(3)(b)). Indeed, s 119(1) states
that it is an offence for a person to knowingly or recklessly to make in a request under s 116
a statement that is misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular. This gives the court
a discretion and it may refuse to make an order, e.g. in the case of a pro-hunting charity which
felt that a disclosure of members might be detrimental. A compromise might be achieved by
the company offering to act as a post-box for confidential communication to and from members (see P vF Ltd[2001] NLJR 284). The Court of Appeal accepted a similar post-box undertaking from a company and refused to make an order for inspection in Pelling v Families
Need Fathers Ltd[2002] 2 All ER 440 where the defendant company was a charity with the
object of helping parents to stay in touch with their children after separation or divorce.
If on application under s 117(1)(b), the court does not direct the company not to comply
with the s 116 request, the company must comply with the request immediately upon the
court giving its decision (s 117(5)).
According to s 119(2), it is an offence for a person in possession of information obtained
by exercise of either of the rights conferred by s 116 to do anything that results in the information being disclosed to another person, or to fail to do anything with the result that the
information is disclosed to another person, knowing or having reason to suspect that person
may use the information for a purpose that is not a proper purpose.
The right of inspection terminates on the commencement of winding-up (Re Kent
Coalfields Syndicate[1898] 1 QB 754). Any rights then existing are derived from the insolvency rules, and not from the Act, and may require an order of court.
Obsolete entries in the register
Section 121 states that a company may remove from the register any entry which relates to a
former member where the person concerned has not been a member for at least 10 years.
Rectification of the register
The register of members is under s 127 prima facie evidence of the matters which the
Companies Act requires it to contain.

The register of members
However, the court has power under s 125 to rectify the register if application is made to
(a) the name of any person is without sufficient cause entered in or omitted from the register; or
(b) default is made, or unnecessary delay takes place, in entering on the register the fact that
a person has ceased to be a member.
As well as rectification, the court may order the payment by the company of any damages
sustained by any party aggrieved (s 125(2)). Notice of rectification must be given to the
Registrar of Companies under the terms of the courtâ€™s order (s 125(4)).
The circumstances set out in (a) and (b) above are not the only ones in which the court can
order rectification. For example, rectification will be ordered where joint holders wish to split
the holding because in general terms the rights attaching to the shares, e.g. voting rights, are
vested in the first-named person on the register (see below). The company should therefore
in ordinary circumstances agree to a request to split the holding.
Burnsv Siemens Bros Dynamo Works Ltd[1919] 1 Ch 225
The claimants, Burns and Hambro, were the joint owners of shares in the defendant company. The
shares were entered in the companyâ€™s register in the joint names of Burns and Hambro. The companyâ€™s articles provided that, where there were joint holders, the person whose name appeared
first in the register of members, and no other, should be entitled to vote in respect of the shares.
The result was, of course, that Hambro had no voting rights. This action was brought by Burns and
Hambro asking that the register be rectified so as to show roughly half of the joint shareholding in
the name of each joint holder.
Held- by the High Court - the court had jurisdiction to make such an order, and the company was
required to rectify the register, showing shares numbered 1 to 10,000 in the names of Burns and
Hambro, and shares numbered 10,001 to 19,993 in the names of Hambro and Burns.
Rectification will also be granted where an allotment of shares is set aside following, for
example, a false statement in a prospectus. The consequent action for rescission - if that is the
course the claimant chooses to pursue - is accompanied by a request for rectification of the
Notice of trusts
Under s 126 of the Companies Act 2006, no notice of any trust shall be entered on the
register of members of companies registered in England and Wales. The rule laid down by
the section has two branches:
(a) The company is entitled to treat every person whose name appears on the register as the
beneficial owner of the shares even though he may in fact hold them in trust for another.
Thus, if the company registers a transfer of shares held by a trustee, it is not liable to the
beneficiaries under the trust even though the sale of the shares by the trustee was fraudulent or in breach of the powers given to him in the trust instrument.

Chapter 14 Membership - capacity, registration, director and substantial holdings, annual return
Simpsonv Molsonâ€™s Bank[1895] AC 270
This was an appeal to the Privy Council in England from the Court of Queenâ€™s Bench for Lower
Canada. It appeared that the bank was incorporated by an Act of Parliament, and that by s 36 of
that Act the bank was not bound to take notice of any trust over its shares. (The provision was
similar to the one contained in s 360.) The executors of the Hon John Molson were given 10 years
by his will to wind up his estate. After the expiration of that time, and in breach of the terms of the
will, they made a transfer of certain shares in the bank. The claimants, who had an interest in the
residuary estate of John Molson, brought this action claiming damages from the bank because
it had registered a transfer knowing that transfer to be in breach of trust, such knowledge being
derived from the fact that a copy of the will was deposited at the bank, and that William Molson,
the testatorâ€™s brother, was one of the executors who signed the transfer and was also the president
of the bank.
Held - the bank was not liable for registering the transfer although it had notice that it was in
breach of trust, because s 36 of the Act of Parliament incorporating the bank provided specifically
that it should not take notice of any trust over its shares.
(b) Where persons claim rights in shares under equitable titles, such as an equitable mortgage,
the company is not made into a trustee if those persons merely serve notice on the company
of the existence of their equitable claims.The correct way of protecting such an interest is
by serving a stop notice on the company.
It follows from this branch of the â€˜no trustsâ€™ rule that where there are two or more lenders
on the security of the same shares by way of equitable mortgage, the first in date has priority,
not the first to give notice to the company.
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale de Parisv Walker(1885) 11 App Cas 20
James Walker was the registered owner of 100 shares in Tramways Union Ltd, and he created two
charges over the shares, one on 9 March 1881 in favour of James Scott Walker, who took the
certificates and a blank tra nsfer, and one on 1 December 1882 in favour of the appellants, the
latter charge being created by means of a blank transfer, duly executed but without the deposit of
the share certificate. The appellants tried to obtain registration first, but Tramways Union Ltd would
not register the transfer without the certificates, and later the executors of James Scott Walker
informed the Tramways Union that they had the certificates. This action was brought to decide
who had the title to the shares. The articles of Tramways Union Ltd provided that the company
should not be bound to recognise any equitable interest in its shares. The appellants claimed that
because they notified first the fact of their equitable interest in the shares, they were entitled as
against the executors of James Scott Walker.
Held- by the House of Lords - they were not, because neither the company nor its officers could
be treated as trustees for the purpose of notifying equitable interests over the shares. The title to
the shares was in the person eventually registered by the company, and the company was right in
refusing to register a person who could not produce the share certificates. The respondents were
entitled to the shares.
It should be noted that s 126 only protects the company, and where directors register a
transfer, knowing it is being made in breach of trust or in fraud of some personhaving an equitable right, they may incur personal liability to the person suffering loss.

Director and substantial shareholdings
The rule also means that there can be no registration of a trust as such. An entry on the
register such as â€˜The ABC Family Trustâ€™ would be an infringement of s 126. The correct entry
and the share certificate should show merely the names of the individual trustees without any
reference to the fact that they are trustees or the nature of the trusts. If a note of the existence
of the trust is required for administrative purposes this can be recorded outside the register
possibly with a coded cross-reference.
If a trustee of shares is entered on the register, he is personally liable for the calls made by
the company, though he can claim an indemnity to the extent of the trust property and, if this
is not sufficient, from the beneficiaries personally. A company cannot put a beneficiary on the
list of contributories in a winding-up, though it can enforce the trusteeâ€™s right of indemnity
against the beneficiaries by the doctrine of subrogation(perJames LJ in Re European Society
Arbitration Acts(1878) 8 Ch D 679).
A company claiming a lien on its shares will be affected by a notice of any charge which
arose prior to the debt in respect of which the companyâ€™s lien is being exercised. As we have
seen, this is not regarded as a notice of trust, but is more by way of a notice of lien as between
one trader and another (see Bradford Banking CovBriggs, 1886).
Termination of membership
Termination of membership is complete when the name of a former member is removed
from the register. This may occur by:
(a) transfer of the shares to a purchaser or by way of gift (subject to liability to be put on
the list of members for one year if the company goes into liquidation) (see further
âž¨ See p. 593 Chapter 27 âž¨);
(b) forfeiture, surrender, or a sale by the company under its lien;
(c) redemption or purchase of shares by the company;
(d) the registration of a trustee in bankruptcy, or by his disclaimer of the shares;
(e) death of the member;
(f) rescission of the contract to take the shares arising out of fraud or misrepresentation in
the prospectus, or by reason of irregular allotment;
(g) dissolution of the company by winding-up or amalgamation or reconstruction under
âž¨ See p. 530 Insolvency Act 1986, s 110 (see Chapter 24 âž¨);
(h) compulsory acquisition (see further Chapter 24 âž¨);
(i) under the provisions of the companyâ€™s constitution, e.g. expulsion under the articles for
competing with the company (see Sidebottom vKershaw Leese, 1920).
Director and substantial shareholdings
As we have seen, the register of members merely gives the identity of the person in whose
name the shares are registered. No indication is given of any interests in the shares which
persons other than the registered holder might have. Furthermore, no notice of trust is to be
entered on the register of members of a company registered in England. Where share warrants
are in issue the position is, of course, worse since the names of the holders at any point of time
are unknown, there being no form of registration.

Chapter 14 Membership - capacity, registration, director and substantial holdings, annual return
This situation is capable of abuse. For example, it enables directors to traffic in the securities of their companies without this being known, or someone secretly to acquire control of
a sizeable holding on which to base a bid for control.
The Companies Act deals with the above problems as follows.
The purchase and sale of the companyâ€™s securities by the directors
Section 96A(2)(f) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, states that anyone who discharges managerial responsibilities must disclose transactions conducted on their own account
in shares of the company or derivatives or any other financial instrument relating to those shares.
Section 96B(1) goes on to clarify that the term â€˜discharging managerial responsibilitiesâ€™
means a director, a senior executive who has regular access to inside information relating
directly or indirectly to the company, and to a senior executive who has power to make managerial decisions affecting the future development and business prospects of the company.
This wording extends the scope of the regime beyond that outlined by the Companies Act
1985, but it would appear that the term â€˜shadow directorâ€™ has been omitted under the reforms
(see s 324(6), CA 1985).
Nevertheless, s 96B(2) goes on to state that the obligation extends to persons connected
with anyone who discharges managerial responsibilities within the company. This covers
those previously envisaged as falling within the remit of â€˜connected personâ€™ outlined in s 346
of the Companies Act 1985, as well as to a relative who has on the relevant date shared the
same household as that person for at least 12 months, and a body corporate in which a person â€˜discharging managerial responsibilitiesâ€™ is a director or senior executive.
The Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) require information about the transactions
to be disclosed to the company, including under DTR 3.1.3, the price and volume of the transaction, within 4 business days of the transaction taking place (DTR 3.1.2). This information
must then be passed on by the company to both the market as well as to the Financial Services
Authority (FSA) within one business day (DTR 3.1.2 and 3.1.4).
Unlike under s 325 of the Companies Act 1985, the company is no longer required to
maintain a register of directorsâ€™ interests and dealings, or to report the position on directorsâ€™
interests at the end of the financial year in the directorsâ€™ report (Sch 7, CA 1985). However,
the company is required to file an annual statement with the FSA making reference to all the
information made public over the previous 12 months.
Substantial share interests
The current European Community principles regarding the disclosure of interests in share
holdings is contained in Directive 2004/109/EC, known as the Transparency Directive (TD). This
has seen the removal of the automatic disclosure requirements under the Companies Act and
the transfer of a substantial part of these disclosure requirements to the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). Indeed, the Companies Act 2006 has amended the FSMA to permit
the area to be regulated by the FSA. In this respect, s 1266 of the CA 2006 inserts ss 89A-89G
in to the FSMA 2000. In addition, the FSA has introduced the DTR to deal with this area.
This regime applies to companies which trade on a regulated market (Art 9(1) TD) as
opposed to all public companies as pers 198 of the CA 1985. The domestic regime which has
implemented the Directive applies to all companies with securities traded on a prescribed
market, including any market operated by a Recognised Investment Exchange.

The annual return
The disclosure requirements deal with the percentage of voting rights held in a company
as opposed to the actual holdings of shares. Consequently, according to DTR 5, holdings of
non-voting shares do not have to be disclosed under this regime, nor do shares which are only
entitled to vote in certain circumstances (i.e. variation of class rights). However, it should be
noted that those exercising managerial responsibilities within the company are required to
disclose holdings in non-voting shares as this could give rise to insider dealing.
The notifiable percentage is 3 per cent of the total voting rights in the company and every
1 per cent thereafter. Once these thresholds have been crossed, the individual is required to
disclose the interest to the company within two days (DTR 5.8.3).
Notification must be made, therefore, whenever a known change brings about a known
increase or decrease above or below 3 per cent or a known increase or decrease to the next
percentage point occurs in an interest exceeding 3 per cent. Thus, if a person has an interest
in, say, 10.5 per cent of relevant capital, there is no requirement to notify a change in the
interest unless and until it falls below 10 per cent or increases to 11 per cent.
The company must be notified within two days of the change and the company must
record the details in a register of interests in shares. The register must be available for inspection without charge by any member or by any other person.
A person who fails to notify as required or gives false or misleading information is liable to
a fine or imprisonment or both.
Power of public company to investigate interests
Section 1295 of the Companies Act 2006 repealed s 212 of the CA 1985, which had enabled a
public company to previously make enquiries of any person(not merely a member) whom it
knew or had reasonable cause to believe to be interestedin any of its voting shares either at the
present time or at any time during the preceding three years. This repeal impacts on any s 212
notice issued after 20 January 2007.
The annual retu rn
Under s 854 of the Companies Act 2006, a company must file an annual return with the
Registrar. It must be made up to a date 12 months after the previous return or in the case of
the first return 12 months after incorporation (s 854(2)).
The return must be delivered to the Registrar within 28 days of the make-up date
(s 854(3)(b)) and must contain the information required by or under the provisions of
Part 24 of the 2006 Act.
Contents of annual return
Section 855 of the Companies Act 2006 states that every annual return must state the date to
which it is made up and contain the following information:
(a) the address of the companyâ€™s registered office;
(b) the type of company it is and its principal business activities;
(c) the prescribed particulars of (i) the directors of the company, and (ii) in the case of a private company with a secretary or a public company, the secretary or joint secretaries;

Chapter 14 Membership - capacity, registration, director and substantial holdings, annual return
(d) if the register of members is not kept available for inspection at the companyâ€™s registered
office, the address of the place where it is kept available for inspection;
(e) if any register of debenture holders is not kept available for inspection at the companyâ€™s
registered office, the address of the place where it is kept available for inspection.
Furthermore, s 856(1) goes on to provide that the annual return of a company having share
capital must also contain a statement of capital and the particulars required by s 856(3) to 856(6)
about the members of the company. In this regard, s 856(2) states that the statement of capital
must state with respect to the companyâ€™s share capital at the date to which the return is made up:
(a) the total number of shares of the company;
(b) the aggregate nominal value of those shares;
(c) for each class of shares: (i) prescribed particulars of the rights attached to the shares;
(ii) the total number of shares of that class; and (iii) the aggregate nominal value of shares
of that class, and;
(d) the amount paid up and the amount (if any) unpaid on each share.
Section 856(3) goes on to state that the return must contain the prescribed particulars of
every person who: (a) is a member of the company on the date to which the return is made
up, or (b) has ceased to be a member of the company since the date to which the last return
was made up (or, in the case of the first return, since the incorporation of the company).
The subsection also sets down that the return must conform to such requirements as may be
prescribed for the purpose of enabling the entries relating to any given person to be easily found.
In addition, s 856(4) requires that the return must also state: (a) the number of shares of each
class held by each member of the company at the date to which the return is made up; (b) the
number of shares of each class transferred: (i) since the date to which the last return was made up;
or (ii) in the case of the first return, since the incorporation of the company, by each member
or person who has ceased to be a member; and (c) the dates of registration of the transfers.
Finally, s 856 (6) sets out that where the company has converted any of its shares into stock,
the return must give the corresponding information in relation to that stock, stating the
amount of stock instead of the number or nominal value of shares.
Sanctions if return not made
Section 858(1) provides that if a company fails to deliver an annual return before the end
of the period of 28 days after a return date, an offence is committed by the company and,
subject to s 858(4), every director of the company, and in the case of a private company with
a secretary or a public company, every secretary of the company, and every other officer of the
company who is in default.
Section 858(2) goes on to state that a person guilty of such an offence is liable to a fine and, for
continued contravention, a daily default fine. The contravention continues until such time as an
annual return made up to that return date is delivered by the company to the registrar (s 858(3)).
Power to make further provision by regulations
Section 857(1) states that the Secretary of State may by regulations make further provision as
to the information to be given in a companyâ€™s annual return. The section goes on to note that

The statutory derivative action

The statutory derivative action
The following two chapters are concerned with the various remedies available to minority
shareholders. It should be noted from the outset that many of these remedies are
concerned with the actions or conduct of the companyâ€™s officers (e.g. directors), which
infringe the rights or affect the interests of shareholders. Equally, it should be noted that
not all of these remedies provide a personal remedy to the shareholder in question. Rather,
actions under the exceptions to the rule in Foss v Harbottle (now in statutory form), are
referred to as being â€˜derivative actionsâ€™. In other words, the minority shareholder undertakes
such an action on behalf of, and for the ultimate benefit of, the company and not himself/
Chapter 15 will revisit briefly the s 33 statutory contract, the wording of which suggests
that the parties (i.e. shareholders) to it are in a position to enforce the provisions of the companyâ€™s constitution. Therefore, in terms of shareholder remedies, if a member has a right that
is contained in the articles and is a party to the statutory contract, that member may enforce
their right. Equally, if a member has a right contained in the articles that is being thwarted,
that individual may sue for breach of contract, (see Brownev La Trinidad). Consequently, it
is recommended that this heading should be the first option that is considered when addressing issues of shareholder remedies as it is potentially:
1 a straightforward enforcement of a contractual right/obligation;
2 far less expensive and time consuming for the minority shareholder.
Chapter 15 will then go on to examine the rule in Fossv Harbottleand the minority shareholdersâ€™ actions which are permitted by the exceptions to it, as set out in the case of Edwards
v Halliwelland how this rule has, under the Companies Act 2006, been moved into statutory
form. The case of Foss v Harbottle represents the general principle of company law that
minority shareholders cannot sue for wrongs done to the company or complain of irregularities in the conduct of its internal affairs. This rule rests on two related propositions:
1 the right of the majority to bar a minority action whenever they might lawfully ratify the
alleged misconduct (the principle of majority rule); and
2 the normally exclusive right of the company to sue upon a corporate cause of action (the
principle of the prope r plaintiff).
Chapter 16 will continue the discussion of â€˜minority protectionâ€™ with an examination of two
interrelated statutory remedies. First of all, s 994 of the Companies Act 2006, which permits
a member (shareholder) of a company to petition on the ground of unfair prejudice as well
as s 122(1)(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986, which provides a â€˜just and equitableâ€™ ground for a
member to petition to have the company wound up.
These statutory remedies (particularly s 994) evolved in response to the undue technicality and doctrinal obscurity of the rule in Fossv Harbottle, aiming to provide a broader and
more liberal judicial discretion to the area of shareholder remedies (see the case of Oâ€™Neillv
Phillips). However, despite this rather positive development in the law, it should be noted
that their beneficial effect is largely restricted to small and/or medium-sized private companies. Quite simply, these two remedies are not an appropriate method of dealing with
issues such as corporate abuse in public listed companies (see the case of Re Blue Arrow plc
âž¨ See p. 321 in Chapter 16 âž¨).

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
The s 33 contract revisited
Unlike s 14 of the Companies Act 1985, s 33 refers to â€˜a companyâ€™s constitutionâ€™, rather than its
â€˜memorandum and articlesâ€™. This reflects the new division of formation and constitutional information between the memorandum, articles and other constitutional documents noted above.
However, as outlined in earlier chapters, this option is not without its problems. As such,
you should try to address the following issues. First of all, is the individual in question a party
to the statutory contract (Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheepbreeders Association)?
Secondly, does the right in question fall within the scope of enforceable rights under s 33?
(In other words, is it an insider or outsider right (see Quin & Axtensv Salmon, 1909; Eleyv
Positive Life Association, 1876; Beattiev E & F Beattie Ltd, 1938)?)
In many instances, there may not be a straightforward answer to these questions. Nevertheless, you should always consider this process at the beginning of any minority protection
question. Do not automatically dismiss the possibility of enforcement under the statutory
Shareholdersâ€™ agreements
As noted in previous chapters, many small private companies have converted from partnerships where a partnership contractual agreement has governed the business affairs. Such an
agreement has a vital role to play in terms of s 17 of the Companies Act 2006, which now
states that a companyâ€™s constitution consists of the articles of association and any resolutions
and agreements to which Chapter 3 of the 2006 Act applies. In addition, it plays an invaluable
role in terms of evidencing the expectations of a companyâ€™s members at the time the agreement was drawn up as it will normally contain provisions on how decisions are to be made
on matters such as directorsâ€™ pay, dividends and the employment of key staff. The agreement
is designed so that shareho lders with big holdings cannot in all cases impose their will through
majority voting power, and is of particular importance where shareholder voting can result in
damaging deadlock. One of the most important aspects of the agreement will be the provisions for share valuation on the sale of shares, on leaving the company by retirement or by
death (see Chapter 3 above).
The rule in Foss v Harbottle
Although many functions are delegated to the directorate, the eventual power and control in
a company rests with those shareholders who can command a majority of the voting power.
Thus, a person or group of persons controlling three-quarters of the votes would have complete control of the company, and a little more than half the votes would give considerable
influence allowing, for example, control over appointments to the board.
The principle of majority rule is well established and is emphasised in the matter of
litigation by the rule in Fossv Harbottle, 1843 (see below). Generally it does little harm since
most companies are managed fairly, even if at times there is not due concern for the rights of

The rule in Fossv Harbottle
minorities which might lead to oppression. The problem is at its greatest in private companies because the shares of such companies are not listed on the Stock Exchange, the protection of the Stock Exchange rules is not available, and there is rarely any press comment on
their activities.
The rule in Fossv Harbottle, 1843 states that in order to redress a wrong done to a company or to the property of the company, or to enforce rights of the company, the proper
claimant is the company itself, and the court will not ordinarily entertain an action brought
on behalf of the company by a shareholder.
Fossv Harbottle(1843) 2 Hare 461
The claimants, Foss and Turton, were shareholders in a company called â€˜The Victoria Park
Companyâ€™ which was formed to buy land for use as a pleasure park. The defendants were the
other directors and shareholders of the company. The claimants alleged that the defendants had
defrauded the company in various ways, and in particular that certain of the defendants had sold
land belonging to them to the company at an exorbitant price. The claimants now asked the court
to order that the defendants make good the losses to the company.
Held - by Vice-Chancellor Wigram - since the companyâ€™s board of directors was still in existence,
and since it was still possible to call a general meeting of the company, there was nothing to prevent the company from obtaining redress in its corporate character, and the action by the
claimants could not be sustained.
Basis of the rule
Four major principles seem to be at the basis of the rule as the decided cases show:
1 The right of the majority to rule. The court has said in some of the cases that an action by
a single shareholder cannot be entertained because the feeling of the majority of the members has not been tested, and they may be prepared, if asked, to waive their right to sue.
Thus the company can only sue (a) if the directors pass a resolution to that effect where the
power is delegated to them; or (b) if the company expresses its desire to sue by an ordinary
resolution in general meeting, whether the power is delegated to the directors or not, since
the power of the members to bring the company into court as a claimant is concurrent with
that of the directors, and if the members wish to bring the company into court and the
directors do not, the wish of the members by ordinary resolution will prevail.
2 The company is a legal person. The court has also said from time to time that since a
company is a persona at law, the action is vested in it, and cannot be brought by a single
3 The prevention of a multiplicity of actions. This situation could occur if each individual
member was allowed to commence an action in respect of a wrong done to the company.
See James LJ in Grayv Lewis(1873) 8 Ch App 1035 at p 1051 - a judgment which is particularly supportive of the multiplicity problem.
4 The courtâ€™s order may be made ineffective. It should be noted that the court order could
be overruled by an ordinary resolution of members in a subsequent general meeting, provided that the general meeting is not controlled by the wrongdoers (see below). As Mellish
LJ said in MacDougallv Gardiner(1875) 1 Ch D 13 at p 25,

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
[...] if the thing complained of is a thing which in substance the majority of the company are
entitled to do [...] there can be no use in having a litigation about it, the ultimate end of which
is only that a meeting has to be called, and then ultimately the majority gets its wishes.
It will be seen, therefore, that the rule in Foss is in no sense helpful to the minority. This
rule means that, for good or bad, the decision-making power within a company lies with
those in control of more than half of the votes in general meetings or boards of directors.
In fact, if there were no exceptions to the rule, the minority could never bring a claim at all.
It is to the exceptions that we must now turn. Consequently, at common law, if the minority
shareholder disagrees with the majority, he has little room to complain. In many instances,
the unhappy shareholder in a public limited company is encouraged to use his â€˜power of exitâ€™
- in other words to sell his shares on the Stock Market.
However, consider the position of a minority shareholder within a private limited company: Where is the available market? Is the shareholder able to sell his shares to individuals
external to the company? (Consider pre-emption clauses.) How will the shares be valued? The
main exception to this restriction on the ability of the minority shareholder to object to the
actions of the majority arises in instances where there is a â€˜fraud on the minorityâ€™. However,
even in these circumstances success is not guaranteed.
The obscure nature of the rule in Fossv Harbottlehas meant that in the past individuals
have been refused a remedy, despite the merits of the case.
However, since October 2007, minority shareholders have been allowed a new statutory
derivative action. The two rules in Fossv Harbottlewill continue to apply, although the absence
of one or the other will no longer be a bar to commence proceedings. Before exploring the
new statutory derivative action, it is necessary to provide some context for the rule (and the
exceptions to the rule contained in Edwardsv Halliwell) in Fossv Harbottle.
Acts infringing the personal rights of shareholders
These actions are not so much genuine exceptions to the rule in Foss, they are more in the nature
âž¨ See p. 101 of situations which are outside it. Thus, in Penderv Lushingon, 1877 (see Chapter 4 âž¨) the
court dealt with the attemp ted removal of the claimantâ€™s right to vote without suggesting that
the rule in Fossin any way prevented the action from being brought.
Exceptions to the rule - generally
Although the courts have not developed an entirely clear pattern of exceptions, those set out
below appear to be the main areas in which the court will allow claims to be brought by shareholders as an exception to the rule in Foss (which has now been replaced by the new provisions of the CA 2006).
1 Acts which are ultra vires or illegal. No simple majority of members can confirm or
ratify an illegal act. Section 39 of the Companies Act 2006 gives an individual member
a statutory right to ask the court for an injunction to restrain the directors from entering
into ultra vires transactions but not if the members of the company have ratified a particular transaction by special resolution. So far as illegality is concerned, the minority could
bring an action to force the directors to comply with the law restricting, for example,
loans, quasi-loans and credit given by the company to directors and their connected

The rule in Fossv Harbottle
2 Where the act complained of can only be confirmed by a special or extraordinary
resolution. Fossis based on the principle that the majority, i.e. those who can obtain an
ordinary resolution, should decide whether or not a complaint relating to the company
should be brought before the court. Clearly, therefore, a simple majority of the members
cannot be allowed to confirm a transaction requiring a greater majority.
Edwardsv Halliwell[1950] 2 All ER 1064
A trade union had rules, which were the equivalent of articles of association, under which any
increase in membersâ€™ contributions had to be agreed by a two-thirds majority in a ballot of members. A meeting decided by a simple majority to increase the subscriptions without holding a
ballot. The claimants, as a minority of members, applied for a declaration from the court that the
resolution was invalid.
Held- the rule in Fossdid not prevent a minority of a company, or as here, an association of persons, from suing because the matter about which they were suing was one which could only be
done or validly sanctioned by a greater than simple majority. This was broken down as follows:
(i) On the construction of the rules, the alteration in the rates of contribution was invalid;
(ii) The rule in Fossv Harbottledid not afford the trade union a defence because it protected only
irregularities concerning matters which were intra viresthe union and pertained to its internal management; a mere irregularity meant something not involving fraud, oppression or unfairness, but
the action complained of here was strongly tinctured with oppression or unfairness;
(iii) The rule did not apply where a matter was in issue which could only be sanctioned by some
special majority;
(iv) The case was not within the ambit of the rule, for the substance of the complaint was that the
majority had invaded the individual rights of members.
3 Where there is a fraud on the minority. The rule in Fosswould create grave injustice if
the majority were allowed to commit wrongs against the company and benefit from those
wrongs at the expense of the minority simply because no claim could be brought in respect
of the wrong. Thus, there is a major and somewhat ill-defined exception referred to as
â€˜fraud on the minorityâ€™. For example, in Estmanco (Kilner House) Ltdv Greater London
Council[1982] 1 All ER 437, Megarry V-C noted that: â€˜It does not seem to have yet become
very clear exactly what the word â€œfraudâ€ means in this context; but I think it is plainly
wider than fraud at common law...â€™ Equally, in Burlandv Earle[1902] AC 83, the court
stated that a straightforward example of fraud is â€˜...where a majority are endeavouring
directly or indirectly to appropriate to themselves money, property or advantages which
belong to the companyâ€™. However, in Pavlidesv Jensen, 1956 (see below), it was held that
a loss caused to a company through the negligence of its directors who had derived no personal gain through the transaction did not constitute a fraud on the minority. Finally, in
Danielsv Daniels[1978] Ch 406 (below) it was held that a derivative claim arose where a
substantial profit was made upon the resale of company land sold to a director. Therefore,
it should be noted that fraud in this context is not confined to literal or common law fraud
and may include the misappropriation of corporate property; mala fide abuse of power
(refer to directorsâ€™ duties); discrimination against a section of the membership; as well as
errors of judgment from which the directors have benefited. The following headings
describe the main areas of fraud.

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
(a) Where the company is defrauded. Examples of this exception are to be found in the
following cases which involved misappropriation of the companyâ€™s property.
Menierv Hooperâ€™s Telegraph Works Ltd(1874) 9 Ch App 350
Company A (European and South American Telegraph Co) was formed to lay a transatlantic cable
to be made by Hooperâ€™s, the majority shareholder in company A, from Portugal to Brazil. Hooperâ€™s
found that they could make a greater profit by selling the cable to another company B, but B did
not have the government concession to lay the cable which company A had. After much intrigue
with the Portuguese government trustee of the concession, he agreed to transfer the concession
to company B, and company B then bought the cable from Hooperâ€™s. To prevent company A from
suing for loss of the concession Hooper obtained the passing of a resolution to wind up company
A voluntarily and arranged that a liquidator should be appointed whom Hooper could trust not to
pursue the claim of company A in respect of the loss of its contract. Menier, a minority shareholder
of company A, asked the court to compel Hooper to account to company A for the profits made
on the sale of the cable to B.
Held - by the Court of Appeal in Chancery - where the majority shareholders of a company propose to gain a benefit for themselves at the expense of the minority, the court may interfere to protect the minority. In such a case one shareholder has a right to bring a derivative claim to seek
relief and the claim is not barred by the rule in Fossv Harbottle. This was a blatant case of fraud
and oppression and Hooperâ€™s were trustees of the profit and had to account to company A for it.
It seems that in cases like Menierand Cook(below) it is the company which is defrauded. It might
therefore be better to rename the jurisdiction as â€˜fraud upon the companyâ€™. The claim is, after all,
brought on behalf of the company and is therefore derivative (see below), and the company takes
the benefit of any damages recovered. The value of the shares may fall giving a loss to individual
shareholders but since the Court of Appeal held in Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman
Industries[1982] 1 All ER 354 that this loss was not recoverable by individual shareholders, at least
where it is caused by fraud or negligence, it seems that the claim is basically for defrauding the
Cookv Deeks[1916] 1 AC 554
This action was brought in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario by the
claimant, suing on behalf of himself and other shareholders in the Toronto Construction Co Ltd,
against the respondents, who were directors of the company. The claimant sought a declaration
that the respondents were trustees of the company of the benefit of a contract made between the
respondents and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co for construction work. It appeared that the
respondents, while acting on behalf of the company in negotiating the contract, actually made it
for themselves and not for the company, and by their votes as holders of three-quarters of the
issued share capital, subsequently passed a resolution at a general meeting declaring that the
company had no interest in the contract.
Held- by the Privy Council:
(a) that the contract belonged in equity to the company, and the directors could not validly use
their voting powers to vest the contract in themselves, in fraud of the minority;
(b) in cases of breach of duty of this sort, the rule in FossvHarbottledid not bar the claimantâ€™s claim.

The rule in Fossv Harbottle
âž¨ See p. 334 In Industrial Development Consultantsv Cooley, 1972 (see Chapter 17 âž¨) there was a not dissimilar misappropriation of a corporate opportunity. However, in the Cooley case there was no
need to resort to a derivative claim because Mr Cooley had made the profit for himself. The whole
board was not involved and was clearly anxious to bring the company into court in order to sue Mr
Cooley for recovery of the profit.
(b) Where the minority as individuals are defrauded
(i) Expulsion of minority. This will amount to fraud unless it is done bona fide and for the
benefit of the company.
Brownv British Abrasive Wheel Co[1919] 1 Ch 290
The company required further capital. The majority, who represented 98 per cent of the shareholders, were willing to provide this capital but only if they could buy up the 2 per cent minority.
The minority would not agree to sell and so the majority shareholders proposed to alter the articles
to provide for compulsory acquisition under which nine-tenths of the shareholders could buy out
any other shareholders.
Held- by Astbury J - that the alteration of the articles would be restrained because the alteration
was not for the benefit of the company. In addition, the rule in Foss v Harbottle did not bar the
claimantâ€™s claim.
A contrast is provided by Dafen Tinplate Co Ltd v Llanelli Steel Co (1907) Ltd, 1920, and
âž¨ See p. 119 Sidebottomv Kershaw Leese & Co, 1920 (see Chapter 5 âž¨).
(ii) Inequitable use of majority power. An example of this jurisdiction is to be found in the
following case.
Clemensv Clemens Bros[1976] 2 All ER 268
In this case the issued share capital of Â£2,000 in a small but prosperous family company was held
between the claimant (45 per cent) and her aunt (55 per cent), the aunt being one of the five directors of the company. The directors proposed to increase the companyâ€™s share capital to Â£3,650
by the creation of a further 1,650 voting ordinary shares. The four directors, other than the aunt,
were to receive 200 shares each, and the balance of 850 shares was to be placed in trust for the
companyâ€™s long-service employees. The claimant objected to the proposed resolution to put this
scheme into effect since the result would be to reduce her shareholding to under 25 per cent. At
the extraordinary general meeting called to approve the scheme, the aunt voted in favour of the
resolutions which were passed. The claimant sought a declaration against both the company and
the aunt that the resolutions should be set aside on the ground that they were oppressive of the
claimant. The defendant contended that if two shareholders honestly hold differing opinions, the
view of the majority should prevail, and that shareholders in general meeting were entitled to consider their own interests and to vote in any way they honestly believed proper in the interest of the
company. In giving judgment in favour of the claimant, Foster J made it clear that in the circumstances of this case Miss Clemens (the aunt) was not entitled to exercise her majority vote in whatever way she pleased. The judge found difficulty, however, in expressing this as a general principle

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
of law, in terms, for example, of expressions such as â€˜bona fide for the benefit of the company as
a wholeâ€™, â€˜fraud on a minorityâ€™, and â€˜oppressiveâ€™. He came to the conclusion that it would be unwise
to try to produce a principle because the circumstances of each case are infinitely varied. He did say,
âž¨ See p. 40 however, following a phrase of Lord Wilberforce in Westbourne Galleries(see Chapter 1 âž¨), that
the right of a shareholder to exercise voting rights in any way whatever is subject always to equitable considerations which may in particular circumstances make it unjust to exercise votes in a
certain way. Dealing with the facts before him, Foster J then went on to say:
I cannot escape the conclusion that the resolutions have been framed so as to put into the hands of
Miss Clemens and her fellow directors complete control of the company and to deprive the [claimant]
of her existing rights as a shareholder with more than 25 per cent of the votes, and greatly reduce her
rights. They are specifically and carefully designed to ensure not only that the [claimant] can never get
control of the company, but to deprive her of what has been called her negative control. [Here the
judge is referring to her ability to block special and extraordinary resolutions.] Whether I say that these
proposals are oppressive to the [claimant] or that no-one could honestly believe that they are for her
benefit, matters not. A court of equity will in my judgment regard these considerations as sufficient to
prevent the consequences arising from Miss Clemens using her legal right to vote in the way she has
and it would be right for a court of equity to prevent such consequences taking effect.
(i) The case is quoted to show the very wide power which equity reserves to itself to control the
activities of majority shareholders. On the particular facts of this case, of course, the pre-emption
rights given to shareholders by s 89 should prevent the sort of prejudicial conduct towards a
minority which was alleged in this case. The claimant could, of course, have prevented the other
members from effecting the disapplication of pre-emption rights under s 95 because a special
âž¨ See p. 379 resolution is required for this (see further Chapter 19 âž¨).
(ii) Although Foster J was not prepared to put the case into any existing category of Fossexceptions, fraud on the minority seems a possible one.
(iii) The allotment was presumably also invalid because it was an improper exercise of the directorsâ€™ powers.
The exception of fraud on the minority depends where the company is defrauded on
â€˜wrongdoer controlâ€™, i.e. the individual shareholder must show that the wrongdoers control
the company as where they control the board and general meetings and will not permit an
action to be brought in the companyâ€™s name. Furthermore, wrongdoer control is essential
because cases of misappropriation of property and breach of duty can be ratified by a 51 per
cent majority of the members which is not controlled by the wrongdoers. However, how does
a shareholder demonstrate this? In other words, what is the process by which the shareholder
establishes locus standi - the right to bring a derivative action on behalf of the company
against these alleged wrongdoers in a particular case?
The wrongdoers will obviously be in the above position if they have voting control as they
had, for example, in Menierand Cook. However, in Prudential Assurance Co Ltdv Newman
Industries Ltd [1980] 2 All ER 841 Vinelott J held that de facto control was enough, i.e. the
company does what the wrongdoers want even though the wrongdoers do not have voting
control. They are able to persuade the majority to follow them. The Court of Appeal did not
accept this reasoning because it requires a trial to see if there is evidence of control, whereas
voting control is obvious from shares held and voting rights. However, they gave no guidance
as to what might be meant by control. This was followed by Smithv Croft (No 2)[1987] 3 All
ER 909 in which it was noted that the court can investigate the conduct of the voting and
count heads in order to assess the views of other shareholders, independent of the plaintiffs

The rule in Fossv Harbottle
and the wrongdoers, and in essence what they think should be done in the circumstances. In
this scenario the organ capable of reviewing the matter will usually be the General Meeting.
Following this, where the majority of independent shareholders would vote against legal
proceedings, then no claim in the companyâ€™s name should lie.
Smithv Croft(No 2)[1988] Ch 114
The articles of F Ltd provided that a director should be remunerated for his services at the rate of
Â£150 per annum, the chairman receiving an additional Â£100 per annum, but the rate of remuneration could be increased by an ordinary resolution. The directors were also empowered to appoint
one or more of their number to be holders of an executive office, and any director appointed to
such office was to receive such additional remuneration by way of salary, lump sum, commission
orparticipation in profits as the directors might determine. During the course of 1982 the appointed
executive directors and companies with which they were associated acquired sufficient shares in
F Ltd to give them overall voting control. The shares were bought by means of payments made to
three of the associated companies in August 1982 of Â£33,000 each, part of which was then lent
to the fourth to discharge a bank loan taken out for the purpose of obtaining cash to buy shares in
F Ltd and the remainder was used for the purchase of shares by the three associated companies.
The plaintiffs, who held a minority of shares in F Ltd, brought an action against F Ltd, three
executive directors and the chairman, a non-executive director, and four companies closely associated with one or other of the three executive directors, claiming that the directors had paid themselves excessive remuneration, that the payments in 1982 to the associated companies were
contrary to section 42 of the Companies Act 1981 and that certain payments of expenses to directors were excessive. The plaintiffs between them held 11.86 per cent of the issued shares in F Ltd;
the defendants between them held 62.54 per cent; of the remaining shares 2.54 per cent were held
by a company which actively supported the plaintiffs, while 3.22 per cent were held by persons or
companies which, it was common ground, were to be treated as supporting the defendants. W Ltd,
a company not under the control of either the plaintiffs or the defendants, held 19.66 per cent of
the shares in F Ltd and was opposed to the continuance of the plaintiffsâ€™ action.
The chairman and F Ltd sought a motion to strike out the plaintiffsâ€™ action under RSC, Ord 18,
r 19 or under the inherent jurisdiction as vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of process.
Held - (1) that the defendantsâ€™ application raised the issue whether the plaintiffs could proceed
with their minority shareholdersâ€™ action and, although that raised difficult questions of law, the
defendants, by invoking the procedure under RSC, Ord 18, r 9 rather than the procedure for determining a preliminary issue of law under RSC, Ord 33, r 3, had not adopted such an inherently
defective procedure that the court should not proceed to determine the issues raised; and that
since the effect of the court deciding those issues against the plaintiffs would be determinative
of the action, the court would entertain the application and consider whether prima facie the company was entitled to the relief claimed in the action and whether the action was within the exception to the rule in Fossv Harbottle.
(2) That although excessive remuneration paid to directors might be an abuse of power, where the
power to decide remuneration was vested in the board, it could not be ultra vires the company;
and that in view of the uncontradicted evidence about the specialised field in which the company
operated and the high levels of remuneration obtaining there it was more likely that the plaintiffs
would fail than succeed on the issue of quantum; that likewise no prima facie case had been
shown that the executive directorsâ€™ expenses were excessive; and that, prima facie, the payments
to associated companies were not ultra vires since payments at the request of an executive director to an outside entity were capable of being payments in respect of services rendered by the
executive director, save that there was a prima facie case of irregularity regarding certain payments

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
not fully cured by subsequent adoption of the accounts at the annual general meetings at which
those payments should have been disclosed; that since the admitted payments of Â£33,000 to
associated companies had not been shown to be reasonably necessary for the purpose of providing for amounts likely to be incurred by way of directorsâ€™ remuneration there was a prima facie
case of infringement of s 42 of the Companies Act 1981.
(3) That although a minority shareholder had locus standi to bring an action on behalf of a company to recover property or money transferred or paid away in an ultra virestransaction, he did not
have an indefeasible right to prosecute such an action on the companyâ€™s behalf; that it was proper
to have regard to the views of the independent shareholders, and their votes should be disregarded only if the court was satisfied that they would be cast in favour of the defendant directors
in order to support them rather than for the benefit of the company, or if there was a substantial
risk of that happening; that there was no evidence to suggest that the votes of W Ltd would be
cast otherwise than for reasons genuinely thought to be for the companyâ€™s advantage; and that,
accordingly, since the majority of the independent shareholdersâ€™ votes, including those of W Ltd,
would be cast against allowing the action to proceed, the statement of claim should be struck out.
4 Fraud and negligence. It is still not entirely certain whether damage caused by negligence
can be brought under the heading of â€˜fraudâ€™ for the purposes of the exception of â€˜fraud on
the minorityâ€™. In Pavlidesv Jensen, 1956 (below) the court held that negligence, however
gross, was not included. However, in Danielsv Daniels, 1978 (below) Templeman J, in distinguishing Pavlides, said that a minority shareholder who had no other remedy should be
able to sue whenever directors use their powers intentionally or unintentionally, fraudulently or negligently, in a manner which benefits them at the expense of the company.
Vinelott J accepted this view in the Newman case. The Court of Appeal in that case did not
give any guidance but the general approach of the court was restrictive and suggests that
negligence which does not result in personal benefit to the wrongdoers might still be
ratifiable by a general meeting even with the votes of the wrongdoers and, therefore, not
within the definition of fraud on the minority.
Pavlidesv Jensen[1956] 2 All ER 518
The directors of the Tunnel Asbestos Cement Co Ltd sold an asbestos mine to the Cyprus
Asbestos Mines Ltd in which the TAC Ltd held 25 per cent of the issued capital. The mine was
sold for Â£182,000 but the sale was not submitted to a general meeting of TAC for approval. The
claimant, who was a minority shareholder in TAC, claimed that the defendant directors were negligent because the mine was worth Â£1,000,000, and this price or something like it should have been
obtained. He sued the directors with the company as a nominal defendant for a declaration that
the directors were in breach of duty, and for an enquiry into the damage caused to TAC by their
negligence and for payment of that sum by the directors to TAC. On the preliminary point as to the
competence of the claimant as a minority shareholder to bring a derivative action in these circumstances, it was held - by Danckwerts J - that the action was not maintainable because the sale
was intra vires and, since no acts of a fraudulent character were alleged by the claimant, the sale
could be approved by the majority of shareholders and it was a matter for them.
(i) The claimant was alleging negligence which is a common law claim and derivative actions are
creatures of equity, the judiciary being reluctant to extend them to common law claims such as
negligence.

The rule in Fossv Harbottle
(ii) This line of reasoning was followed in Multinational Gasv Multinational Gas Services[1983] 2
All ER 563 where two judges in the Court of Appeal were of opinion that a claim for negligent mismanagement could not be brought even by a liquidator against directors whose actions had been
approved by a majority of the members who were not a disinterested majority because they had
appointed the directors as their nominees.
Danielsv Daniels[1978] 2 All ER 89
Mr Douglas Daniels, Mr Gordon Daniels and Mrs Soule, three minority shareholders in Ideal Homes
(Coventry) Ltd, wished to bring an action against the majority shareholders (who were also the
directors), Mr Bernard Daniels, Mrs Beryl Daniels and the company. In their claim the minority
alleged that in October 1970 Ideal Homes, acting on the instructions of the majority shareholders,
sold and conveyed freehold property in Warwick to Mrs Beryl Daniels for Â£4,250 when they knew,
or ought to have known, that the correct value of the land was higher. The majority, in reply to
these allegations, said that they adopted a valuation made for probate purposes in June 1969 on
the occasion of the death in that month of Mr Joseph Daniels, the father of the minority shareholders and Mr Bernard Daniels. Against this the minority shareholders alleged that probate valuations were conservative as to amount and usually less than the value obtainable on open market
between a willing seller and buyer.
In 1974 the land was sold by Mrs Daniels for Â£120,000 and although the majority had every
intention of denying the allegations, they asked at this stage that the claim of the minority be struck
out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or otherwise as an abuse of the process of the
court. It was argued, on behalf of the majority, that since the minority was not alleging fraud against
the majority no action on behalf of the alleged loss to the company could be brought because
under the decision in Foss v Harbottle, 1843 the court could not interfere in the internal affairs
of the company at the request of the minority. The minority said they were unable to allege fraud
because they were not able to say precisely what had happened beyond the matters set out in
their claim.
Templeman J, who had not been asked to try the action but only to say whether there was
an action at all, reviewed the decisions under the rule in Fossv Harbottle, 1843 and his judgment
made clear that if the bre ach of duty alleged turned out to be a breach of fiduciary duty, then it
should be allowed to proceed under the rule in Cookv Deeks, 1916 because the majority could
control general meetings. Furthermore, if the breach of duty alleged was one of skill and care, i.e.
negligence at common law, then it should also be allowed to proceed as an exception to Fossv
Harbottle, 1843 because the alleged negligence had resulted in a profit to one of the directors
which distinguished this case from Pavlidesv Jensen, 1956.
Procedural aspects
When a shareholder is suing to restrain the majority from acting illegally or continuing
to commit a personal wrong upon him he has a choice. He may sue in his own name or in
the representative form on behalf of himself and other shareholders with whom he enjoys the
right allegedly denied to him. The relief asked for will normally be a declaratory judgment
saying what the law is and by which the parties intend to abide, or an injunction to restrain
the conduct complained of if it is thought the majority will still continue to act unfairly.
Where the individual member is seeking a claim against third parties for the companyâ€™s
benefit so that he is trying to enforce a claim which belongs to the company, his claim is called
derivative.

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
In a personal or representative claim the company is a real and genuine defendant. In a
derivative action the company is joined as a nominal defendant because the directors and the
majority of the members of the company will not bring the company into court as a claimant.
The company is made a party to the action so that the judge may grant it a remedy by being
brought in as a nominal defendant, the claimant naming the company as a defendant in his
claim form.
The remedy of damages is available in a derivative claim. The damages go to the company
and not to the claimant. However, the claimant is entitled to an indemnity for his costs from
the company (Wallersteinerv Moir (No 2)[1975] 1 All ER 849).
A derivative action is not available to challenge the form in which a companyâ€™s accounts
are prepared. The Companies Act requires the appointment of auditors who must report
upon the accounts and this is the protection which statute law gives to the exclusion of other
remedies (Devlinv Slough Estates Ltd[1982] 2 All ER 273). It should be noted, however, that
the courts may distinguish the Devlincase and intervene where the company concerned has
taken advantage of the audit exemption.
A derivative action for fraud in the minority is an equitable remedy. Thus, the plaintiff
must come with clean hands (Towersv African Tug Co[1904] 1 Ch 558). The plaintiff must
not have been involved in the wrongdoing (Nurcombev Nurcombe[1985] 1 All ER 65). This
contrasts with petitions under s 994 where, according to Nourse J in Re London School of
âž¨ See p. 326 Electronics, 1985 (discussed in Chapter 16 âž¨), there is no overriding requirement that the
petitioner should come to court with clean hands.
The rule in Fossis a rule of procedure. It is a matter to be decided before the trial of the allegations as to whether the claimant can be allowed to proceed to a trial under an exception to
There is a firm statement to this effect by the Court of Appeal in Prudential Assurancev
Newman (No 2)[1982] 1 All ER 354 where the court was critical of the approach of the trial
judge in taking evidence in proof of the allegations for many days and at great cost to the
defendants before deciding that a claim could proceed as an exception to Foss.
Prudential Assurance Co Ltdv Newman Industries Ltd(No 2) [1982] Ch 204, CA
Cumming-Bruce, Templeman and Brightman LJ took it in turns to read the following judgment of
the Court of Appeal:
It is commonly said that an exception to the rule in Fossv Harbottlearises if the corporation is â€˜controlledâ€™ by persons implicated in the fraud complained of, who will not permit the name of the company
to be used as plaintiffs in the suit: see Russellv Wakefield Waterworks Co(1875) LR 20 Eq 474, 482.
But this proposition leaves two questions at large, first, what is meant by â€˜controlâ€™, which embraces
a broad spectrum extending from an overall absolute majority of votes at one end, to a majority of
votes at the other end made up of those likely to be cast by the delinquent himself plus those voting
with him as a result of influence or apathy. Secondly, what course is to be taken by the court if, as
happened in Fossv Harbottle, in the East Pant Ducase and in the instant case, but did not happen
in Atwoolv Merryweather, the court is confronted by a motion on the part of the delinquent or by the
company, seeking to strike out the action? For at the time of the application the existence of the fraud
is unproved. It is at this point that a dilemma emerges. If, upon such an application, the plaintiff can
require the court to assume as a fact every allegation in the statement of claim, as in a true demurrer,
the plaintiff will frequently be able to outmanoeuvre the primary purpose of the rule in Foss v
Harbottleby alleging fraud and â€˜controlâ€™ by the fraudster. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has to
prove fraud and â€˜controlâ€™ before he can establish his title to prosecute his action, then the action may

The statutory derivative action
need to be fought to a conclusion before the court can decide whether or not the plaintiff should be
permitted to prosecute it. In the latter case the purpose of the rule in Fossv Harbottledisappears.
Either the fraud has not been proved, so cadit quaestio; or the fraud has been proved and the delinquent is accountable unless there is a valid decision of the board or a valid decision of the company
in general meeting, reached without impropriety or unfairness, to condone the fraud [...]
We desire, however, to say two things. First, as we have already said, we have no doubt whatever
that Vinelott J erred in dismissing the summons of 10 May 1979. He ought to have determined as a
preliminary issue whether the plaintiffs were entitled to sue on behalf of Newman by bringing a derivative action. It cannot have been right to have subjected the company to a 30-day action (as it was
then estimated to be) in order to enable him to decide whether the plaintiffs were entitled in law to
subject the company to a 30-day action. Such an approach defeats the whole purpose of the rule in
Fossv Harbottleand sanctions the very mischief that the rule is designed to prevent...
The second observation which we wish to make is merely a comment on Vinelott Jâ€™s decision that
there is an exception to the rule in Fossv Harbottlewhenever the justice of the case so requires. We
are not convinced that this is a practical test, particularly if it involves a full-dress trial before the test
is applied. On the other hand, we do not think that the right to bring a derivative action should be
decided as a preliminary issue upon the hypothesis that all the allegations in the statement of claim
of â€˜fraudâ€™ and â€˜controlâ€™ are facts, as they would be on the trial of a preliminary point of law. In our view,
whatever may be the properly defined boundaries of the exception to the rule, the plaintiff ought at
least to be required before proceeding with his action to establish a prima facie case (i) that the company is entitled to the relief claimed, and (ii) that the action falls within the proper boundaries of the
exception to the rule in Fossv Harbottle. On the latter issue it may well be right for the judge trying
the preliminary issue to grant a sufficient adjournment to enable a meeting of shareholders to be convened by the board, so that he can reach a conclusion in the light of the conduct of, and proceedings at, that meeting.
The statutory derivative action
The new action is found within ss 260-264 of the Companies Act 2006. It is worth noting
though that in the Explanatory Notes to the CA 2006, it is noted that â€˜the sections in this Part
do not formulate a substantive rule to replace the rule in Fossv Harbottle, but instead reflect
the recommendations of the Law Commission that there should be a â€œnew derivative procedure with more modern, flexible and accessible criteria for determining whether a shareholder can pursue an actionâ€ (Shareholder Remedies, paragraph 6.15).â€™ However, in Stainerv
Lee[2010] EWHC 1539 (Ch), Roth J stated: â€˜The jurisdiction governing derivative claims in
England and Wales is now comprehensively governed by Chapter 1 of Part 11 of the Act:
sections 260-264. Such claims may be brought only under the provisions in that chapter or
pursuant to a court order in proceedings on an â€œunfair prejudiceâ€ petition under section 994;
section 260(2).â€™
Section 260(1) defines a derivative claim as â€˜[...] proceedings by a member of a company
(a) in respect of a cause of action vested in the company, and (b) seeking relief on behalf of
the companyâ€™. Accordingly, there are three elements to the derivative claim: the action is
brought by a member of the company; the cause of action is vested in the company; and relief
is sought on the companyâ€™s behalf. With respect to the term â€˜memberâ€™, while this is defined
in s 112 of the 2006 Act, s 260(5) extends the scope of this to include â€˜a person who is not a
member but to whom shares in the company have been transferred or transmitted by operation of lawâ€™. This would include, for example, where a trustee in bankruptcy or the personal

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
representative of a deceased memberâ€™s estate acquires an interest in a share as a result of the
bankruptcy or death of a member.
Section 260(2) goes on to state that a derivative claim may only be brought under this
chapter (of the 2006 Act) or s 994 (unfairly prejudicial conduct).
However, a key provision in relation to the statutory derivative action is s 260(3) which
states that: â€˜A derivative claim under this chapter may be brought only in respect of a cause
of action arising from an actual or proposed act or omission involving negligence, default,
breach of duty or breach of trust by a director of the company.â€™ This section states that the
cause of action must be against the director or another person (for instance if a third party
dishonestly assisted a director in breaching his fiduciary duties). Therefore, s 260(3) provides
shareholders with a statutory right to sue directors for negligence (in itself a change from preexisting common law; Pavlidesv Jensen[1956 1 Ch 565), default, breach of duty (see directorsâ€™
duties, ss 170-176) or breach of trust.
The remaining subsections in s 260 read as follows. Section 260(4) goes on to state that â€˜it
is immaterial whether the cause of action arose before or after the person seeking to bring or
continue the derivative claim became a member of the companyâ€™. Section 260(5) clarifies
those persons whom may be included within the terms used by the section. For example, for
the purposes of this chapter (of the 2006 Act), the term â€˜directorâ€™ includes a former director;
a shadow director is treated as a director; and references to a member of a company include
a person who is not a member but to whom shares in the company have been transferred or
transmitted by operation of law.
However, it is important to realise that members do not have unfettered discretion to bring
a derivative action. The member must apply to the court for permission to bring the action.
Section 261(1) states that â€˜a member of a company who brings a derivative claim under this
chapter must apply to the court for permission to continue itâ€™. Section 261(2) goes on to note
that if it appears to the court that the application and the evidence filed by the applicant in
support of it do not disclose a prima facie case for giving permission (or leave), the court (i) must
dismiss the application; and (ii) may make any consequential order it considers appropriate.
Section 261(3) goes on to note that if the application is not dismissed under s 261(2) then
the court may give directions as to the evidence to be provided by the company, and may
adjourn the proceedings to enable the evidence to be obtained.
On hearing the application, the court may according to s 261(4) give permission to continue the claim on such terms as it thinks fit; refuse permission and dismiss the claim; or
adjourn the proceedings on the application and give such directions as it thinks fit.
As such, this clause provides that, once proceedings have been brought, the member is
required to apply to the court for permission to continue the claim. This reflects the current
procedure in England and Wales under the Civil Procedure Rules. The applicant is required
to establish a prima facie case for the grant of permission, and the court will consider the issue
on the basis of his evidence alone without requiring evidence to be filed by the defendant.
The court must dismiss the application at this stage if what is filed does not show a prima facie
case, and it may make any consequential order that it considers appropriate (for example, a
costs order or a civil restraint order against the applicant). If the application is not dismissed,
the court may direct the company to provide evidence and, on hearing the application, may
grant permission, refuse permission and dismiss the claim, or adjourn the proceedings and
give such directions as it thinks fit.
Section 262 concerns the alternative scenario of a company commencing an action, only
for a member to take it forward as a derivative action. This section is unlikely to be relied

The statutory derivative action
upon to a great extent. Under both s 261 and s 262, the member must demonstrate two points
before action can commence. First, the member has sufficient evidence to establish a prima
facie case and secondly, the member needs to persuade the court that a derivative action is
appropriate. The advantages of this two-stage test are that it will limit actions and minimise
the initial expenditure of the company.
Section 263 outlines the considerations which the court must weigh up under an application from both s 261 and s 262. Section 263(2) states that a court must refuse permission for
a derivative action if the court is satisfied:
(a) that a person acting in accordance with s 172 would not seek to continue the claim; or
(b) where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that is yet to occur, that the act
or omission has been authorised by the company; or
(c) where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has already occurred, that
the act or omission (i) was authorised by the company before it occurred, or (ii) has been
ratified by the company since it occurred.
If any of these three situations are met, then the court must refuse to allow the derivative
action to proceed.
If the situation the court is presented with does not fall within one of the three situations
as listed in s 263(2), then the court can proceed to consider a number of discretionary factors
listed in s 263(3), which states that in considering whether to give permission (or leave) the
court must take into account, in particular:
(a) whether the member is acting in good faith in seeking to continue the claim;
(b) the importance that a person acting in accordance with s 172 (duty to promote the
success of the company) would attach to continuing it;
(c) where the cause of action results from an act or omission that is yet to occur, whether the
act or omission could be, and in the circumstances would be likely to be -
(i) authorised by the company before it occurs; or
(ii) ratified by the company after it occurs;
(d) where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has already occurred,
whether the act or omission could be, and in the circumstances would be likely to be,
ratified by the company;
(e) whether the company has decided not to pursue the claim;
(f) whether the act or omission in respect of which the claim is brought gives rise to a cause of
action that the member could pursue in his own right rather than on behalf of the company.
The case of Aireyv Cordell[2006] EWHC 2728 (Ch) considers the approach courts should
take in deciding whether or not to permit a derivative action. In this case the court decided
that where a shareholder applies to the court for permission to bring a derivative claim he is
required to establish both that there is a prima facie case that the company is entitled to the
relief sought and that the action falls within the boundaries of one of the exceptions to the
rule that a member cannot bring an action on behalf of a company. If no reasonable board
would bring proceedings then, even if there is a prima facie case, the court should not sanction proceedings. Where, however, the court is satisfied that a reasonable board of directors
could bring the action; the court should not shut out the shareholder on the basis of its own
view of what it would do if it were the board.
Section 263(4) reads as follows: â€˜In considering whether to give permission the court shall
have particular regard to any evidence before it as to the views of members of the company

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
who have no personal interest, direct or indirect, in the matter.â€™ It is interesting to note that
the court must pay particular regard to the views of the â€˜independentâ€™ members of the company and there is not merely a requirement to take into account their views. It could be
argued that this should be the most prevalent thought in the mind of the judges as they decide
whether a derivative action should proceed or not.
Future interpretation and implementation of s 260
During the early stages of the Companies Bill, there was concern that this new statutory
derivative action would open the floodgates to litigation. However, it seems that the â€˜checksâ€™
provided by the court will prevent this. Earlier concerns that the rule, together with the exceptions to Fossv Harbottle, would be removed are unfounded and it seems that the Companies
Act 2006 has merely established a new derivative procedure.
To date, there have been a small number of reported cases which have considered the new
derivative action. In the first couple of reported cases, Franbar Holdings Ltd v Patel and
Others[2008] EWHC 1534 (Ch), Mission Capital plcv Sinclair and Another[2008] All ER (D)
225 (Mar), and Stimpson v Southern Landlords Association [2009] EWHC 2072 (Ch),
permission to continue derivative actions was refused.
Franbar Holdings Ltdv Patel and Others[2008] EWHC 1534 (Ch)
Following consideration of the matters contained within s 263 of the Companies Act 2006, the
court ruled that the claimant had not been shown that the hypothetical director would have
attached great importance to the continuation of the derivative claim at the instant stage in the proceedings. In this regard, considerable weight had to be given to the fact that the claimant could
achieve all that it could properly want through the s 994 petition and the shareholdersâ€™ action.
Accordingly, the application for permission to continue the derivative action would be dismissed.
In this respect, Mr William Trower QC noted:
[...] I am required to take into account is the importance that a person acting in accordance with
section 172 would attach to continuing the derivative claim. I have already concluded that I cannot
be satisfied that such a person would not seek to continue it, but section 263(3)(b) requires me to
form a judgment as to how important the hypothetical director would regard the continuation of the
proceedings as being. This is not a particularly easy exercise, but if he would not attach very much
importance to the continuation of the claim, that is likely to count against the grant of permission.
If, in fulfilling his duty to promote the success of the company, he would attach substantial importance to the continuation of the claim, that factor is likely to count in favour of granting permission.
In my judgment, the hypothetical director acting in accordance with section 172 would take into
account a wide range of considerations when assessing the importance of continuing the claim. These
would include such matters as the prospects of success of the claim, the ability of the company to
make a recovery on any award of damages, the disruption which would be caused to the development of the companyâ€™s business by having to concentrate on the proceedings, the costs of the proceedings and any damage to the companyâ€™s reputation and business if the proceedings were to fail.
A director will often be in the position of having to make what is no more than a partially informed
decision on continuation without any very clear idea of how the proceedings might turn out [...]
In conclusion, I take the view that there is substance in the complaints which have been made
by Franbar and that some of those complaints would, if established, give rise to breaches of duty
which are incapable of ratification on the votes of Casualty Plus. I also take the view that there is work
still to be done in formulating a clear claim for breaches which have caused actionable loss to
Medicentres, and that it would be open to the hypothetical director to decline to proceed with the

The statutory derivative action
derivative claim at this stage. While he may attach importance to its continuation at some stage in the
future, I am not satisfied that he would attach great importance to its continuation now. I also give
considerable weight to the fact that Franbar should be able to achieve all that it can properly want
through the section 994 petition and the shareholdersâ€™ action. Having regard to all of these considerations, and carrying out the balancing exercise as best I can on the information currently available, it
is my judgment that justice is best achieved by refusing permission to continue.
The acquisition of evidence relating to the affairs of an insolvent debtor for use in other proceedings was capable of being a legitimate use of Rule 7.31(4) of the Insolvency Rules so long as that
evidence was probative of (or at least related to) a fact or matter in issue in those proceedings, and
so long as the person to whom material on the court file related was not able to point to any countervailing prejudice. Inspection in those circumstances was consistent with the purpose for which
the right was given, that was to enable persons with a legitimate interest in a particular insolvency
proceeding to discover what had taken place. Those criteria were met in this case.
Accordingly, the order would be made subject to the condition that, in the absence of further
order, the copies and the information obtained were to be used only for the purposes of the s 994
petition and the shareholdersâ€™ action.
Mission Capital plcv Sinclair and Another[2008] All ER (D) 225 (Mar)
The defendants had been the executive directors of the claimant company and clause 16.1.6 of
their contracts provided that the board could terminate them if they engaged in conduct that was
unacceptable in the reasonable opinion of the board. Clause 18 provided that if the defendantsâ€™
contracts were so terminated they were immediately to resign all directorships. At a board meeting in February 2008, the three non-executive directors of the company purported to remove the
defendants from the board pursuant to cl 16.1.6 and on the basis that they had allegedly failed to
submit financial information and to meet financial forecasts. Those allegations were disputed by the
defendants. P was appointed to the board as a new director with executive powers. Subsequently,
the company issued a claim against the defendants and obtained interim injunctive relief. The defendants issued a counterclaim by which they sought injunctions obliging the company to continue to
employ them and to re-appoint them to the board. The defendants also issued a derivative claim
under the Companies Act 2006. A number of interim applications in both actions fell to be determined.
The principal issues that fell to be determined were: (i) whether the defendants were to be
granted interim injunctions restoring them to their positions before the meeting of February 2008;
(ii) whether the non-executive directors and P were to be joined as parties to the defendantsâ€™ counterclaim in the companyâ€™s action; and (iii) whether the defendants were to be granted permission to
continue their derivative action under s 263 of the 2006 Act.
The court ruled that the injunctions sought by the defendants essentially amounted to orders
for specific performance of their service contracts with the company. In relation to the injunction
pertaining to their employment, the defendants had failed to show, on the evidence, that there was
a seriously arguable case that they would succeed in obtaining the relief sought at trial. In relation
to the injunction as regards the directorships, while the defendants had demonstrated an arguable
case, the balance of justice weighed against the grant of the interim injunctions sought. The nonexecutive directors and P would be joined as parties to the defendantsâ€™ counterclaim.
Furthermore, the court held that the basis for the mandatory refusal of permission to continue
the defendantsâ€™ derivative claim under s 263(2) of the 2006 Act had not been made out. However,
having considered the discretionary factors set out in s 263(3)(a)-(f) of the 2006 Act, and the circumstances of the instant case, the defendantsâ€™ application for permission to continue the derivative action would be refused.

Chapter 15 The statutory derivative action
Other cases have included Iesini v Westrip Holdings Ltd [2009] EWHC 2526 (Ch) and
Fanmailuk.com Ltdv Cooper[2008] EWHC 2198 (Ch), in which applications for permission
to continue derivative claim were adjourned. However, in more recent cases, Kianiv Cooper
[2010] EWHC 577 (Ch) and Stainerv Lee[2010] EWHC 1539 (Ch), the courts have appeared
far more open to the prospect of granting permission to minority shareholders to continue
with derivative actions, though permission extended only to the conclusion of disclosure, at
which point further permission to continue should be sought.
Kianiv Cooper[2010] EWHC 577 (Ch)
The applicant shareholder and director (K) of the second respondent company (X) applied under
s 261 of the Companies Act 2006 for permission to continue a derivative claim under s 260 of
the Act on behalf of X against the first respondent shareholder and director (C) of the same
company for breach of duty. K and C were the sole directors and equal shareholders in X, a property development company. C was also the director of another company (D) which billed X for
services. A dispute arose between K and C. K alleged that C had wrongly allowed a judgment in
default to be entered against X in respect of a debt allegedly owed to D. The default judgment
was later withdrawn. K also alleged that, through his control of Xâ€™s accounts, C had caused a
further debt to be entered into Xâ€™s accounts in respect of unsubstantiated services rendered to it
by another company. K further obtained an injunction restraining C from presenting a winding-up
petition in respect of monies allegedly owed to him in his personal capacity by X. Proudman
A derivative claim is defined by s 260 as a claim brought by a member seeking relief on behalf of a
company in respect of a cause of action vested in the company. Although the cause of action may
be against a director of the company or another person or both, it must arise from an actual or proposed act or omission by the director involving negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust
(see s 260(3)).
Permission to continue a derivative action is required by s 261. The court must by that section dismiss the application for permission if there is no prima facie case for giving permission. Otherwise it
may give directions as to the evidence to be provided and adjourn the proceedings to enable such
evidence to be obtained. I t has very wide powers to adjourn the application, to give directions and to
give or refuse permission. It has wide powers to impose terms on the grant of permission.
Section 263 specifies the criteria for permission. Section 263(2) is mandatory and states that
permission must be refused if the court is satisfied that a person acting in accordance with the duty
imposed by s 172 to promote the success of the company would not seek to continue the claim, or
where the cause of action arises from an act or omission which has been pre-authorised or has been
ratified by the company.
Section 263(3) sets out the factors which the court must in particular take into account in deciding whether to give permission. They are: whether the member is acting in good faith in seeking to
continue the claim, the importance that a person acting in accordance with s 172 would attach to continuing it, whether the cause of action could be authorised or ratified by the company, whether the
company has decided not to pursue the claim and whether the act or omission in respect of which
the claim is brought gives rise to a cause of action that the member could pursue in his own right
rather than on behalf of the company. Further, the court is required by s 263(4) to have particular
regard to any evidence before it as to the views of members of the company who have no personal
interest, direct or indirect, in the matter. In this case there are no such persons.
Although Mrs Kiani and Mr Cooper were the only two directors and members of the company,
Mr Kiani was the driving force behind his wifeâ€™s involvement and for present purposes they have an
identity of interest. No question of authorisation or ratification arises or is likely to arise. The crucial

The statutory derivative action
factors of those listed in s 263(3) are therefore likely to be good faith, the availability of an alternative
remedy and, in particular, the attitude of a person acting in accordance with the duties imposed by
s 172 of the Act...
In all the circumstances of this case it seems to me is that Mrs Kiani is acting in good faith in
making the present application.
Another factor prescribed by s 263(3) is the availability to Mrs Kiani of an alternative remedy in
respect of the alleged breaches of duty. Mr Irvin submits that one proper remedy would be a personal
action under the shareholdersâ€™ agreement. However, it seems to me that such an action could meet
real difficulties in that the loss claimed could be viewed as loss reflective of the companyâ€™s loss,
irrecoverable under the principle enunciated in Johnson vGore Wood & Co[2001] BCC 820; [2002]
Mr Irvinâ€™s principal submission is however that Mrs Kianiâ€™s proper remedy is an unfair prejudice
petition under s 994 of the Companies Act 2006. Under s 996 the court has a very wide discretion as
to the relief it may grant, including, by s 996(2)(c), authorising civil proceedings in the name of and on
behalf of the company.
There is a lot to be said for this procedure in a case of a two-person company where the real dispute is between those two persons alone. However, the jurisdiction to make an order under s 996(2)(c)
can only be exercised if the court is first satisfied that the unfair prejudice petition is well-founded.
Mrs Kiani would not therefore have standing on behalf of the company to restrain a winding-up petition. It may well be the case that the court would have jurisdiction on her application to restrain a
winding-up petition pending the outcome of s 994 proceedings. I have not been addressed on that
issue. Moreover, yesterday Mr Cooper and DPM, through Mr Irvin, said for the first time that they were
willing to offer an undertaking not to present creditorsâ€™ petitions pending s 994 proceedings.
Taking all those factors into consideration, it seems to me that Mrs Kianiâ€™s position is this. She
says that she and the company have been deprived of the opportunity to pursue the development
venture. She does not want the company to be wound up on the petition of Mr Cooper, at whose door
she places responsibility for the deadlock which has occurred. She wants her opportunity to be preserved. She wishes to pursue Mr Cooper on behalf of the company in a derivative action. It seems to
me that the fact that she could in a more roundabout way achieve the relief she seeks does not mean
that she ought not to be granted permission in the present case...
It seems to me that, balancing all the relevant factors, Mrs Kianiâ€™s application to continue the
action in the name of the company ought to be granted. However, I am prepared to give permission
only down to disclosure in the action, for the reasons I have already explained.
Held- Application granted.
(1) C had failed to adduce any corroborative evidence in support of his defence to the allegations
against him. In respect of Xâ€™s dealings with D, C should, as one of Xâ€™s signatories, at least have
ensured that cogent evidence of any transaction between those parties was well documented in
light of the possible conflict of interests. In pursuing the case it was clear that K had been acting
in good faith; Câ€™s actions having deprived her of an opportunity to pursue a number of development
ventures. Although it was possible for K to pursue a petition under the Companies Act 2006, s 994
as opposed to bringing her derivative action, the existence of an alternative remedy was only one
factor to consider. Finally, it was obvious that a notional director, acting in accordance with his
duties under s 172 would wish to continue with the claim against C, at least, down to the disclosure stage where corroborative documents might be produced. Balancing those facts together, K
would be allowed to pursue her derivative claim.
(2) In a case where the dispute was between two people, the court ought to take a reasonable view
as to whether to grant the petitioner an indemnity in respect of her costs. In the instant case it was
fair, in light of the courtâ€™s conclusion, that K should be indemnified for her costs but that she should
have no indemnity in respect of a potential adverse costs order.

The applicant (S) applied under the Companies Act 2006, s 261 for permission to continue a
derivative claim seeking relief on behalf of the relevant company (C) against the respondents, being
Câ€™s two directors and a company (E) of which one of the directors (L) was the sole shareholder
and director. S had a small shareholding in C. E had been established by L as a special-purpose
vehicle for the acquisition of shares in C. By 2002, it had acquired a 65 per cent shareholding in
C with the aid of a bank loan exceeding Â£4 million. The discharge of Eâ€™s liability to its bank was
achieved by a loan made by C to E. Between 2002 and 2008, C made substantial additional
loans to E. S argued that L and his fellow director had acted in breach of their duties to C in allowing the lending to E to be on an interest-free basis and in lending sums to E for some purpose
other than discharging or reducing the liability which E had incurred for the acquisition of shares
in C, which purpose had not been approved by Câ€™s members and was not in its interests. E, S
asserted, was a constructive trustee for C as regards the sums received by way of the additional
Held- Application granted.
(1)The test to be applied was that set out by Lewison J in Iesini v Westrip Holdings Ltd [2009]
EWHC 2526 (Ch), [2010] BCC 420, Iesiniapplied. As to the standard to be applied generally under
s 263, Lewison J held that something more than simply a prima facie case was required and that
the court had to form a view on the strength of the claim, albeit on a provisional basis. The
necessary evaluation was not mechanistic and a range of factors would have to be considered
to reach an overall view. If the case seemed very strong, it might be appropriate to continue it
even if the likely level of recovery was not so large, as such a claim stood a good chance of provoking an early settlement or might qualify for summary judgment. On the other hand, it might
be in the companyâ€™s interests to continue a less strong case if the amount of potential recovery
was very large.
(2)The failure to obtain interest over a period of almost nine years on lending to E that rose from
Â£4.6 million to Â£8.1 million constituted very strong grounds for a claim that the directors were in
breach of their fiduciary duties. It had been asserted that the outstanding interest had been repaid,
but it was not clear whether that was so. It would therefore be appropriate to grant S permission
to continue the derivative claim until the conclusion of disclosure.
(3)There was at least a well arguable case that the additional lending to E was made in breach
of the directorsâ€™ relevant duties. Lâ€™s witness statement fell far short of explaining the purpose
of the additional loans or why they were thought to be in Câ€™s best interests. There was no indication whatever of why E needed the sums in question or indeed what it was using the money for.
L had sought to rely on a â€˜new loan agreementâ€™ between C and E, but that did not constitute
ratification of the additional lending. It could not be said that the shareholders who had voted
in favour of the resolution approving the agreement had given their informed consent: they
appeared not to have been told the purpose of the agreement or of Lâ€™s interest in E. If the resolution were vitiated for this reason, the entry into the new loan agreement might itself be contrary
to Câ€™s best interests and the promotion of the agreement might be a further breach of the directorsâ€™ duties.
(4)As the derivative action was to proceed, S was entitled to be indemnified by C as to his reasonable costs, subject to a limit of Â£40,000, Wallersteinerv Moir (No.2)[1975] Q.B. 373 applied.

The protection of minorities

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
There are several other sections in the Companies Act 2006 which enable a number of
shareholders to defy the majority, as discussed in previous chapters (e.g. s 633 where
dissentient holders of 15 per cent of the issued shares of the class can apply for cancellation of
the variation).
Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
Section 994 exists as an alternative to the statutory derivative action discussed in the previous
chapter. This was of particular importance prior to the 2006 Act as it provided a relatively
more accessible and straightforward route for shareholders than the complex and restrictive
rule in Fossv Harbottle. However, given the changes under the 2006 Act, the relative importance of this section could be called into doubt.
Section 994 was originally introduced in the form of s 210 of the Companies Act 1948 (and
subsequently as s 459 of the Companies Act 1985) and was intended to provide more flexible
remedies which were also free from the harshness of s 122(1)(g), also discussed in this chapter.
The Cohen Committee (Cmnd 6659, 1945) had recommended this development in the area
of minority shareholder protection but their views were based on the concept of â€˜oppressionâ€™.
In other words, a member could bring an action where the affairs of the company were being
conducted in a manner oppressive to some of the members (including the petitioner).
However, the wording in s 210 proved to be a problem, resulting in the fact that there were
only two successful cases under the section (Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd v
Meyer[1958] 3 All ER 66; Re H R Harmer Ltd[1958] 3 All ER 689).
Consequently, s 210 was regarded as unsuccessful with the Jenkins Committee subsequently recommending that it should be replaced with a new remedy based on the notion
of â€˜unfairly prejudicial conductâ€™. This led to the introduction of s 459 of the Companies Act
1985, which has been replaced by s 994 of the Companies Act 2006.
Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltdv Meyer[1958] 3 All ER 66
PerLord Denning:
Such being â€˜the matters complained ofâ€™ by Dr Meyer and Mr Lucas, it is said: â€˜Those are all complaints
about the conduct of the co-operative society. How do they touch the real issue - the manner in which
the affairs of the textile company were being conducted?â€™ The answer is, I think, by their impact on
the nominee directors. It must be remembered that we are here concerned with the manner in which
the affairs of the textile company were being conducted. That is, with the conduct of those in control
of its affairs. They may be some of the directors themselves, or, behind them, a group of shareholders
who nominate those directors or whose interests those directors serve. If those persons - the
nominee directors or the shareholders behind them - conduct the affairs of the company in a manner
oppressive to the other shareholders, the court can intervene to bring an end to the oppression.
What, then, is the position of the nominee directors here? [...] It is said that these three directors
were at most only guilty of inaction - of doing nothing to protect the textile company. But the affairs
of a company can, in my opinion, be conducted oppressively by the directors doing nothing to defend
its interests when they ought to do something - just as they can conduct its affairs oppressively by
doing something injurious to its interests when they ought not to do it.
The question was asked: What could these directors have done? They could, I suggest, at least
on behalf of the textile company, have protested against the conduct of the co-operative society.

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
They could have protested against the setting up of a competing business. But then it was said: What
good would that have done? Any protest by them would be sure to have been unavailing, seeing that
they were in a minority on the board of the co-operative society. The answer is that no one knows
whether it would have done any good. They never did protest and it does not come well from their
mouths to say it would have done no good, when they never put it to the test [...] So I would hold
that the affairs of the textile company were being conducted in a manner oppressive to Dr Meyer and
Mr Lucas [...]
One of the most useful orders mentioned in the section - which will enable the court to do justice
to the injured shareholders - is to order the oppressor to buy their shares at a fair price: and a fair
price would be, I think, the value which the shares would have had at the date of the petition, if there
had been no oppression. Once the oppressor has bought the shares, the company can survive. It can
continue to operate. That is a matter for him. It is, no doubt, true that an order of this kind gives to
the oppressed shareholders what is in effect money compensation for the injury done to them: but I
see no objection to this. The section gives a large discretion to the court and it is well exercised in
making an oppressor make compensation to those who have suffered at his hands.
True it is that in this, as in other respects, your Lordships are giving a liberal interpretation to
section 210. But it is a new section designed to suppress an acknowledged mischief. When it
comes before this House for the first time it is, I believe, in accordance with long precedent - and particularly with the resolution of all the judges in Heydonâ€™s case - that your Lordships should give such
construction as shall advance the remedy and that is what your Lordships do today. I would dismiss
the appeal.
Any member or personal representative may petition the court on the grounds that the affairs
of the company are being, or have been, or will be, conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial
to the interests of its members generally, or of some part of its members, including the petitioner
himself. The court must, among other things, be satisfied that the petition is well founded.
The provision relating to a petition by personal representatives of a deceased shareholder
is important because a major form of abuse in private companies has been the refusal by
the board, under powers in the articles, to register the personal representatives of a major
deceased shareholder and also to refuse to register the beneficiaries under the will or on intestacy. Although personal representatives have some rights, e.g. to receive dividends, they
cannot vote unless they are registered, nor can a beneficiary. The holding is therefore rendered powerless and the motive of the board is often to purchase the holding themselves at an
advantageous price.
The provisions apply to conduct past, present or future. In Re Kenyon Swansea Ltd (1987)
The Times, 29 April, the High Court decided that it was sufficient to support a petition that
an act had been proposed which if carried out or completed would be prejudicial to the
petitioner. Thus the giving of notice of a meeting at which the directors propose to use their
majority power to introduce policies allegedly unfair to the minority is probably enough for
the minority to commence a claim under s 994. The court also decided that it was enough that
the affairs of the company had, in the past, been conducted in such a way as to be unfairly
prejudicial to the petitioner, even though at the date of the petition the unfairness had been
remedied. The court could still make an order to check possible future prejudice.
The use of the word â€˜conductâ€™ is important since it covers both acts and omissions, e.g. failure to pay proper dividends when profits allow.
Of even greater importance, however, at least in terms of the case law, is the interpretation
placed by the courts, in particular by Mr Justice Hoffmann in Re A Company (No 00477 of

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
1986)[1986] PCC 372, on â€˜interests of its membersâ€™. Many of the petitions presented under
the unfair prejudice provisions have been in regard to the removal of a director from the
board of a private company. The director concerned has been able to establish that the conduct relating to him as a director was also unfairly prejudicial to him as a member because the
â€˜interestâ€™ of a member in a private company legitimately includes a place on the board.
The requirement that the petition be â€˜well foundedâ€™ is to ensure that the provisions are not
abused or used for a wrongful purpose. An earlier case under different legislation provides
a valid illustration. In Re Bellador Silk Ltd[1965] 1 All ER 667 a member of the company presented a petition to the court for relief, but mainly as a form of harassment of the board in
order to make them pay an alleged debt to one of his companies. The court decided that the
petition had a collateral purpose and dismissed it as not a bona fide attempt to get relief.
The test for unfairness is objective and thus the fact that the minority feel that they are
being unfairly treated is not enough. The starting point is whether or not the conduct of the
majority is in accordance with the articles (as Hoffman LJ said in Saul D Harrison[1995] 1
BCLC 14). The matter often turns upon whether the powers which the shareholders have
entrusted to the majority shareholder/directors which are fiduciary powers have been exercised for the benefit of the company as a whole.
Re Saul D Harrison and Sons plc[1995] 1 BCLC 14
Hoffman LJ observed:
â€˜Unfairly prejudicialâ€™ is deliberately imprecise language which was chosen by Parliament because its
earlier attempt in s 210 of the Companies Act 1948 to provide a similar remedy had been too restrictively construed. The earlier section had used the word â€˜oppressiveâ€™, which the House of Lords in
Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society v Meyer [1959] AC 324 said meant â€˜burdensome, harsh
and wrongfulâ€™. This gave rise to some uncertainty as to whether â€˜wrongfulâ€™ required actual illegality or
invasion of legal rights. The Jenkins Committee on Company Law, which reported in 1962, thought
that it should not. To make this clear, it recommended the use of the term â€˜unfairly prejudicialâ€™, which
Parliament somewhat tardily adopted in s 75 of the Companies Act 1980. This section is reproduced
(with minor amendment) in s 994 (previously s 450 of the Companies Act 1985) [...]
In deciding what is fair or unfair for the purposes of s 994 (previously 459), it is important to have
in mind that fairness is being used in the context of a commercial relationship. The articles of association
are just what their name implies: the contractual terms which govern the relationships of the
shareholders with the company and each other. They determine the powers of the board and the
company in general meeting and everyone who becomes a member of a company is taken to have
agreed to them. Since keeping promises and honouring agreements is probably the most important
element of commercial fairness, the starting point in any case under s 994 (previously 459) will be to
ask whether the conduct of which the shareholder complains was in accordance with the articles of
association [...]
Although one begins with the articles and the powers of the board, a finding that conduct was not
in accordance with the articles does not necessarily mean that it was unfair, still less that the court
will exercise its discretion to grant relief. There is often sound sense in the rule in Fossv Harbottle.
In choosing the term â€˜unfairly prejudicialâ€™, the Jenkins Committee (at para 204) equated it with Lord
Cooperâ€™s understanding of â€˜oppressionâ€™ in Elder v Elder & Watson 1952 SC 49 at p 55: â€˜a visible
departure from the standards of fair dealing, and a violation of the conditions of fair play on which
every shareholder who entrusts his money to a company is entitled to relyâ€™. So trivial or technical
infringements of the articles were not intended to give rise to petitions under s 994 (previously 459).
Not only may conduct be technically unlawful without being unfair: it can also be unfair without
being unlawful. In a commercial context, this may at first seem surprising. How can it be unfair to act

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
in accordance with what the parties have agreed? As a general rule, it is not. But there are cases in
which the letter of the articles does not fully reflect the understandings upon which the shareholders
are associated...
Thus, the personal relationship between a shareholder and those who control the company may
entitle him to say that it would in certain circumstances be unfair for them to exercise a power conferred by the articles upon the board or the company in general meeting. I have in the past ventured
to borrow from public law the term â€˜legitimate expectationâ€™ to describe the correlative â€˜rightâ€™ in the
shareholder to which such a relationship may give rise. It often arises out of a fundamental understanding between the shareholders which formed the basis of their association but was not put into
contractual form, such as an assumption that each of the parties who has ventured his capital will
also participate in the management of the company and receive the return on his investment in the
form of salary rather than dividend. These relationships need not always take the form of implied
agreements with the shareholder concerned; they could enure for the benefit of a third party such as
a joint venturerâ€™s widow. But in Re Westbourne GalleriesLord Wilberforce went on to say: â€˜It would
be impossible, and wholly undesirable, to define the circumstances in which these considerations
may arise. Certainly the fact that the company is a small one, or a private company, is not enough.
There are very many of these where the association is a purely commercial one, of which it can safely
be said that the basis of association is adequately and exhaustively laid down in the articles. The
superimposition of equitable considerations requires something more [...]
Thus, in the absence of â€˜something moreâ€™, there is no basis for a legitimate expectation that the
board and the company in general meeting will not exercise whatever powers they are given by the
articles of association.
In this case, as the judge emphasised, there is nothing more. The petitioner was given her shares
in 1960 pursuant to a reorganisation of the share capital which vested the entire control of the company in the A shareholders and the board whom they appointed. This scheme is binding upon her and
there are no special circumstances to modify its effects. Although the petition speaks of the petitioner
having various â€˜legitimate expectationsâ€™, no grounds are alleged for saying that her rights are not
â€˜adequately and exhaustivelyâ€™ laid down by the articles. And in substance the alleged â€˜legitimate
expectationsâ€™ amount to no more than an expectation that the board would manage the company in
accordance with their fiduciary obligations and the terms of the articles and the Companies Act.
Essentially a minority claim - s 994
Section 994 of the Companies Act 2006 is essentially designed to protect the minority against
unfairly prejudicial conduct by the majority. Indeed, s 994(1) states â€˜A member of a company
may apply to the court by petition for an order under this Part on the ground (a) that the
companyâ€™s affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to
the interests of members generally or of some part of its members (including at least himself);
or (b) that an actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.
The provisions will not normally be available to enable the majority to acquire the shares
of a minority under a court order, even though there is evidence that the minority concerned
is acting in an unfairly prejudicial way. This is because the majority control the company and
can remove directors and so on and, in effect, put matters right without the aid of the court.
Thus in Re Legal Costs Negotiators Ltd[1998] CLY 695 two partners converted their business
into a limited company in which one held 75 per cent of the shares and the other 25 per cent.
The majority shareholder alleged that the minority shareholder was not carrying out his
dutiesproperly and obtained his resignation from the board. He was also dismissed from his
employment with the company. The majority shareholder then asked the court to use s 994
to grant him an order requiring the minority to sell his shares to him. The High Court refused

the claim as an inappropriate use of the provisions. After all, the majority shareholder had
removed his ex-partner from the board and from his employment, and to that extent had
removed any problems to the company that might have resulted from the alleged conduct of
the minority.
Relief available under s 996
(a) Specific relief
This is as follows:
(i) The court may make an order regulating the companyâ€™s affairs for the future (s 996(2)(a)).
(ii) The court may restrain the doing of or the continuing of prejudicial acts (s 996(2)(b)).
The above two heads are illustrated quite validly by the following case decided under earlier
legislation.
Re H R Harmer Ltd[1958] 3 All ER 689
The company was formed in July 1947, to acquire a business founded by Mr H R Harmer, who was
born in 1869. The business of the company was stamp auctioneering and dealing in and valuing
stamps. Two of Mr Harmerâ€™s sons, Cyril and Bernard Harmer, went into the business on leaving
school. The nominal capital of the company was Â£50,000, and Mr Harmer senior and his wife were
between them able to control the general meetings of the company, and could even obtain special and extraordinary resolutions. Mrs Harmer always voted with her husband. The father and his
two sons were life directors under the articles, the father being chairman of the board with a casting vote. The sons claimed that their father had repeatedly abused his controlling power in the conduct of the companyâ€™s affairs so that they were bound to apply for relief. Mr Harmer senior had,
they said, always acted as though the right of appointing and dismissing senior staff was vested
in him alone, and this right he also extended to the appointment of directors. He also considered
that no director should express a contrary view to that expressed by himself, and had generally
ignored the views of his sons and the other directors and shareholders. In particular he had opened
a branch of the company in Australia in spite of the protests by the other directors, and the branch
had not proved profitable. In addition, he dismissed an old servant and procured the appointment
of his own â€˜yes menâ€™ to the board. He drew unauthorised expenses for himself and his wife and
engaged a detective to watch the staff. He also endeavoured to sell off the companyâ€™s American
business which severely damaged its goodwill. Roxburgh J, at first instance, granted relief under
s 210 (see below), and the Court of Appeal confirmed the order, saying that the relief was properly
granted because the circumstances were such that the court would have been justified in ordering a winding-up. Roxburgh Jâ€™s order provided inter aliathat the company should contract for the
services of Mr Harmer senior as philatelic consultant at a salary of Â£2,500 per annum; that he
should not interfere in the affairs of the company otherwise than in accordance with the valid decisions of the board; and that he be appointed president of the company for life, but that this office
should not impose any duties or create any rights or powers to him.
The courtâ€™s order had the effect of changing the provision in the articles under which Mr Harmer
was a director for life with a casting vote. The order also restrained him for the future from interfering with the valid decisions of the board.

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
(iii) The court may authorise a claim to be brought by the company under s 996(2)(c). This
would appear to allow a minority to obtain redress for the company where it had been
injured by the wrongful acts of the majority. It seems to provide another approach to
that found in Foss v Harbottle, though the claim would not be derivative because the
court would authorise the company to commence the action as a claimant.
(iv) The court may, according to s 996(2)(e), order the purchase of the minority shares at a
fair price either by other members or by the company itself, in which case the court
would also authorise a reduction of capital. This remedy has been by far the most popular and has largely substituted for winding-up under the just and equitable rule which
was formerly the only real way of compelling the majority to return the share capital of
the minority (see below). The court will also give directions as to the basis of the valuation of the shares to produce a fair value. The court will often, for example, direct that
the shares should not be valued as a minority interest for this purpose since this would
depress the value in view of the lack of power in minority shareholders. Since the companies being dealt with by the courts in these minority problem areas are usually private
companies with no stock market share price, the valuation is normally carried out by the
companyâ€™s auditors.
(b) General relief
In addition to the above, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for giving relief
in respect of the matters complained of under s 996(1). Thus, in Re a Company (No 005287
of 1985)[1986] 1 WLR 281, the controlling shareholder took all the profits in management
fees and was ordered to account for the money to the company and this although at the time
of the action he had sold all his shares in the company concerned to his Gibraltar company.
Thus, a petition can be presented even against a person who has ceased to be a member.
Where the shareholding is equal
The court has been faced with a claim under the unfair prejudice provisions where the
members of a private company were equal shareholders and in deadlock in terms of their
relationship. They could not agree who should buy out whom where each had made an offer
to buy the otherâ€™s shares.
Westv Blanchet and Another[2000] 1 BCLC 795
The companyâ€™s business was teaching English under the name of Leicester Square School of
English Ltd. It was a joint venture between Jason West, the petitioner, and Stephen Blanchet. The
nominal capital was Â£100 divided into 100 Â£1 shares. The paid-up capital was Â£2, of which West
and Blanchet held one share each. West was responsible for marketing and Blanchet for management. The second respondent, who was a director with no shares, was responsible for teaching.
The partiesâ€™ relationship broke down and the respondents terminated Westâ€™s employment. He
played no part in management after this but continued as a director/shareholder. West later offered
to buy Blanchetâ€™s shares and Blanchet made an offer for Westâ€™s. However, they could not agree who
should leave the company. West applied to the court for an order under s 996 that Blanchet be
required to sell him the shares, alleging that the two respondents had conducted the companyâ€™s
affairs in a manner prejudicial to him in that they had excluded him from the companyâ€™s affairs and
management decisions. The respondents asked the court to strike out the claim as an abuse of
court process.

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
The judge reached the conclusion that in a case such as this the issue was which offer was the
more reasonable and realistic. Blanchet had funds readily available to buy Westâ€™s shares, but West
had no available personal funds and his offer was short on details. Blanchetâ€™s offer was therefore
the more reasonable and realistic, so the court should strike out Westâ€™s claim.
The case perhaps illustrates the need to resolve disputes such as these by alternative dispute
resolution. The High Court decision does not resolve the deadlock problem in the context of this
case. It simply identifies a good defence against a s 994 claim brought with a request for an order
for the purchase of the respondentâ€™s shares. To avoid being forced out of the company, all the
respondent needs to do is make a more reasonable and realistic counter-offer, and then ask the
court to strike out the petitionerâ€™s claim.
Maybe the petitioner in this case will now accept the respondentâ€™s offer. However, he has not
been ordered to do so. The court was merely asked to strike out his claim.
The motives of the minority: abuse of procedure
The unfair prejudice procedures cannot be used where they would achieve a collateral purpose, as where the board of a company would be required to make a takeover bid at a higher
price than that intended.
Re Astec (BSR) plc[1999] 2 BCLC 556
In 1989, Emerson Electric, a US company, acquired 45 per cent of the Astec shares. It made further acquisitions over the subsequent period so that in March 1997 it held 51 per cent of Astec. In
January 1998, Emerson issued a press release stating that it would buy the remainder of the shares
in Astec at no premium to market value, and would stop making dividend payments.
The minority shareholders petitioned the court under s 459, accusing Emerson of bullying
tactics and asking the court to order it to purchase the remaining shares in Astec at a fair value -
in effect, to undertake a takeover of Astec at an increased price.
Mr Justice Jonathan Parker decided, among other things, that the petition was an abuse of
process and should be struck out. He said:
I fully accept that the petitioners genuinely desire the relief claimed, that is to say an order for the buyout of their own shares. Equally, however...they desire that relief not for itself but because they
hope that, if granted, it will lead to something else, that something else being something which the
court would not order under s 459, namely a takeover bid by Emerson. The petition is, in my judgment, being used for the purposes of exerting pressure in order to achieve a collateral purpose, that
is to say, the making of a takeover bid by Emerson.
The courtâ€™s ruling was a severe blow for the minority, who had costs awarded against them, and
should give pause for thought to those minorities who may see the unfair prejudice procedures as
available, not merely to achieve their own purposes, but to accomplish wider aims.
It is also an abuse of the unfair prejudice procedures to seek to obtain an order for purchase of shares simply because the claimant has lost trust and confidence in the way in which
the company is being run by the other members. There must be some breach of the terms on
which it has been agreed the company should be run.

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
Oâ€™Neill and Anotherv Phillips and Others[1999] 1 WLR 1092
The company, which provided specialist services for stripping asbestos from buildings, employed
Mr Oâ€™Neill as a manual worker in 1983. Mr Phillips, who held the entire issued share capital of 100
Â£1 shares, was so impressed by Mr Oâ€™Neill that in 1985 he gave him 25 shares and appointed him
a director. Shortly afterwards, Mr Phillips had informally expressed the hope that Mr Oâ€™Neill would
be able to take over the day-to-day running of the company and would allow him to draw 50 per
cent of the profits. Mr Oâ€™Neill took over on Mr Phillipsâ€™ retirement from the board, and was duly
credited with half the profits.
In 1991, the industry went into recession, the company struggled and Mr Phillips, who had
become concerned by Mr Oâ€™Neillâ€™s management, resumed personal command. He told Mr Oâ€™Neill
that he would only be receiving his salary and any dividends on his 25 shares, but would no longer
receive 50 per cent of the profits.
In January 1992, Mr Oâ€™Neill petitioned the court for relief against unfair prejudice in respect both
of his termination of equal profit-sharing and the repudiation of an alleged agreement for the allotment of more shares.
The House of Lords unanimously allowed an appeal by Mr Phillips and others from the Court of
Appeal. Lord Hoffmann said that, as to whether Mr Phillips had acted unfairly in respect of equality
of shareholding, the real question was whether in fairness or equity Mr Oâ€™Neill had had a right
to the shares. On that point, one ran up against the insuperable obstacle of the judgeâ€™s finding that
Mr Phillips had never promised to give them. There was no basis consistent with established principles of equity for a court to hold that he had behaved unfairly in withdrawing from the negotiations. The same applied to the sharing of profits.
A member who had not been dismissed or excluded from management could not demand that
his shares be purchased simply because he felt that he had lost trust and confidence in the others
and in the way the company was run.
PerLord Hoffman:
In section 459 Parliament has chosen fairness as the criterion by which the court must decide whether
it has jurisdiction to grant relief. It is clear from the legislative history (which I discussed in In re Saul
D. Harrison & Sons plc[1995] 1 BCLC 14, 17-20) that it chose this concept to free the court from
technical considerations of legal right and to confer a wide power to do what appeared just and equitable. But this does not mean that the court can do whatever the individual judge happens to think
fair. The concept of fairn ess must be applied judicially and the content which it is given by the courts
must be based upon rational principles. As Warner J said in In re J.E. Cade & Son Ltd[1992] BCLC
213, 227: â€˜The court [...] has a very wide discretion, but it does not sit under a palm tree.â€™
Although fairness is a notion which can be applied to all kinds of activities its content will depend upon
the context in which it is being used. Conduct which is perfectly fair between competing businessmen may not be fair between members of a family. In some sports it may require, at best, observance
of the rules, in others (â€˜itâ€™s not cricketâ€™) it may be unfair in some circumstances to take advantage of
them. All is said to be fair in love and war. So the context and background are very important.
In the case of section 459, the background has the following two features. First, a company is an
association of persons for an economic purpose, usually entered into with legal advice and some
degree of formality. The terms of the association are contained in the articles of association and
sometimes in collateral agreements between the shareholders. Thus, the manner in which the affairs
of the company may be conducted is closely regulated by rules to which the shareholders have
agreed. Secondly, company law has developed seamlessly from the law of partnership, which was
treated by equity, like the Roman societas, as a contract of good faith. One of the traditional roles of
equity, as a separate jurisdiction, was to restrain the exercise of strict legal rights in certain relationships in which it considered that this would be contrary to good faith. These principles have, with
appropriate modification, been carried over into company law.
The first of these two features leads to the conclusion that a member of a company will not
ordinarily be entitled to complain of unfairness unless there has been some breach of the terms on

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
which he agreed that the affairs of the company should be conducted. But the second leads to the
conclusion that there will be cases in which equitable considerations make it unfair for those conducting the affairs of the company to rely upon their strict legal powers. Thus, unfairness may consist
in a breach of the rules or in using the rules in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to
good faith [...].
In In re Saul D. Harrison & Sons plc[1995] 1 BCLC 14, 19, I used the term â€˜legitimate expectationâ€™, borrowed from public law, as a label for the â€˜correlative rightâ€™ to which a relationship between
company members may give rise in a case when, on equitable principles, it would be regarded as
unfair for a majority to exercise a power conferred upon them by the articles to the prejudice of
another member. I gave as an example the standard case in which shareholders have entered into
association upon the understanding that each of them who has ventured his capital will also participate in the management of the company. In such a case it will usually be considered unjust,
inequitable or unfair for a majority to use their voting power to exclude a member from participation
in the management without giving him the opportunity to remove his capital upon reasonable terms.
The aggrieved member could be said to have had a â€˜legitimate expectationâ€™ that he would be able to
participate in the management or withdraw from the company.
It was probably a mistake to use this term, as it usually is when one introduces a new label to
describe a concept which is already sufficiently defined in other terms. In saying that it was â€˜correlativeâ€™ to the equitable restraint, I meant that it could exist only when equitable principles of the kind I
have been describing would make it unfair for a party to exercise rights under the articles. It is a consequence, not a cause, of the equitable restraint. The concept of a legitimate expectation should not
be allowed to lead a life of its own, capable of giving rise to equitable restraints in circumstances to
which the traditional equitable principles have no application. That is what seems to have happened
in this case.
As seen in Re Astec (BSR) plc(above), the unfair prejudice provisions are not a â€˜cure-allâ€™ remedy
for shareholders who are not satisfied for a variety of reasons with the way in which the company
is run. In a quasi-partnership company, one â€˜partnerâ€™ should not be entitled at will to require the
other partners to buy his shares at a fair value. There is no support in previous decisions for such
a right of unilateral withdrawal under the provisions. The courts will not construe the requirement
of â€˜unfairly prejudicial conductâ€™ so narrowly.
However, it is worth noting that such a breach does not have to be as straightforward as
the breach of a prior agreement (either written or oral) as to the way in which the company
is to be run. As per Mann J in Halev Waldock[2006] EWHC 364 (Ch),
Lord Hoffman was demonstrating that unfairness does not arise only out of a failure to comply
with prior agreements or to fulfil prior expectations. The relationships between shareholders
are more subtle than that, and Lord Hoffman was recognizing that unfairness can come out of
a situation where the game has moved on so as to involve a situation not covered by the previous arrangements and understanding. In those circumstances the conduct of the affairs of the
company can be unfairly prejudicial within [s 994] notwithstanding the absence of the prior
arrangements, and the court can thus intervene.
Application in a public limited company
Re Blue Arrow plc(below) is one of the rare cases which involved the application of s 994 to
a public limited company. It is worth noting that in this case the court took a far more restrictive view of the way in which the company was to be run and less willing to look beyond the
companyâ€™s memorandum and articles of association.

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
Re Blue Arrow plc[1987] BCLC 585
Vinelott J held:
The petitioner claims that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way unfairly prejudicial
to some part of the members - that is herself - in that putting the resolution and the proposed amendments to the articles of association to the members, and if they are passed then removing her from
the office of president, would be the culmination of the efforts of Mr Berry to exclude her.
Mr Heslop, on behalf of the petitioner, has put forward three grounds in support of the petition.
The first is that, it is said, her right to remain as president is a class right, and he referred me to a
decision of Scott J in Cumbrian Newspapers Group Ltd v Cumberland & Westmorland Herald
Newspaper & Printing Co Ltd[1987] Ch 1; (1986) 2 BCC 99, 227. I can see nothing in that case which
supports the proposition that a right conferred on an individual by the articles of a company to remain
as president until removed in general meeting, and which is unrelated to any shareholding, can, by
any stretch, be described as a class right. A class right is a right attaching, in some way, to a category of the shares of the company. So far as that decision is material at all, it seems to me plainly
against the submission advanced by Mr Heslop. The right claimed, to remain as president, falls, to
my mind, quite clearly within the second category distinguished by Scott J and explained at p 99, 236
of the report. The article did not confer any right on the petitioner as a member of the company.
She would in fact retain the right, even if she sold all her shares; and the office is not, in fact, an exclusive one.
The second ground is that if the article is looked at in the light of the whole of the history, it
becomes clear, it is said, that the petitioner has a legitimate expectation that she will remain president, unless and until she is removed by the machinery provided - that is by resolution of the members - and that an alteration to the articles which gives the power to the directors transgresses that
legitimate expectation.
As was pointed out by Hoffmann J in Re a Company No 00477 of 1986(1986) 2 BCC 99, 171, the
interests of a member are not limited to his strict legal rights under the constitution of the company.
There are wider equitable considerations which the court must bear in mind in considering whether
a case falls within s 459, in particular in deciding what are the legitimate expectations of a member.
If I may say so, I respectfully accept that approach, but it is to my mind impossible, on the face of
the allegations in the petition, to apply it here. Of course, the petitioner had a legitimate expectation
that the affairs of the company would be properly conducted within the framework of its constitution.
I wholly fail to understand how it can be said that the petitioner had a legitimate expectation that
the articles would not be altered by special resolution in a way which enabled her office to be terminated by some different machinery. No doubt there are cases where a legitimate expectation may
be inferred from arrangements outside the ambit of the formal constitution of the company, but
it must be borne in mind that this is a public company, a listed company, and a large one, and
that the constitution was adopted at the time when the company was first floated on the USM.
Outside investors were entitled to assume that the whole of the constitution was contained in the
articles, read, of course, together with the Companies Acts. There is in those circumstances no room
for any legitimate expectation founded on some agreement or arrangement between the directors
and kept up their sleeves and not disclosed to those placing the shares with the public through the
As regards those first two grounds, therefore, I think that the petition, on its face, is so hopeless
that the only right course would be to strike it out.
The Jenkins Committee and unfair prejudice
Section 994 of the Companies Act 2006 (previously s 459, CA 1985) results from recommendations made by the Jenkins Committee which advocated the repeal of s 210 of the 1948 Act
and the substitution of new statutory arrangements. It is of value, therefore, to consider what

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
sort of conduct the Jenkins Committee thought would be â€˜unfairly prejudicialâ€™. It mentioned
the following:
(a) directors appointing themselves to paid posts within the company at excessive rates of
remuneration, thus depriving the members of a dividend or an adequate dividend - and
indeed it was exactly this sort of scenario which caused the court to find unfair prejudice
to a non-director member in Re Sam Weller [1989] 3 WLR 923;
(b) directors refusing to register the personal representatives of a deceased member so that,
in the absence of a specific provision in the articles, they cannot vote, as part of a scheme
to make the personal representatives sell the shares to the directors at an inadequate
(c) the issue of shares to directors and others on advantageous terms;
(d) failure of directors to declare dividends on non-cumulative preference shares held by a
Obviously, some matters affect all the shareholders and not merely a minority, e.g. nonpayment of dividends. However, the provisions as reworded by the Companies Act 2006
clearly now include acts affecting the members generally.
It is not clear, however, whether failure to pay a dividend would amount to unfair prejudicial conduct in every case. Much will depend upon the circumstances. It could be argued,
for example, that ploughing back profits into building up the assets of the company was not
in the circumstances of the case a breach of duty by the directors.
Illustrative case law
In Re a Company (No 004475 of 1982)[1983] 2 WLR 381 Lord Grantchester QC held that no
prejudice arose under what is now s 994 of the Companies Act 2006 simply because the directors of a company refuse to exercise their power to buy the companyâ€™s shares; nor because
they fail to put into effect a scheme which would have entitled the petitioners to sell their
shares at a higher price than they might have been able to otherwise; nor because they proposed to dissipate the companyâ€™s liquid resources by investing them in a partly owned subsidiary. Lord Grantchester also said that it would usually be necessary for a member claiming
unfair prejudice to show that his shares had been seriously diminished in value. However,
in Re R A Noble (Clothing) Ltd[1983] BCLC 273, Nourse J said that the jurisdiction under
s 994 was not limited to such a case and that diminution in the value of shares was not essential. In Re Garage Door Associates[1984] 1 All ER 434, Mervyn Davies J held that a member
could present a petition for a winding-up on the just and equitable ground and petition for
the purchase of his shares under ss 994-996. Such a procedure is not an abuse of the process
of the court. (However, the current Practice Direction indicates that the two claims should
not be made as a matter of course but only where there is a chance that one or the other
will fail.)
With respect to the valuation to be placed on an individualâ€™s shareholding, a member cannot force other shareholders to buy him out at the proportionate share of the companyâ€™s value
which his investment represents (Re Phoenix Office Supplies Ltd [2003] BCC 11). The issue
of valuation was explored further in Sethiv Patel[2010] EWHC 1830 (Ch). The court ordered
one of two shareholders in a company to buy the shares of the other where unfair prejudice
was conceded for the purposes of a petition under s 994. The court also gave directions as to
the basis on which the shares should be valued.

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
Re Phoenix Office Supplies Ltd[2003] BCC 11
This was an appeal against a decision of Blackburne J that by treating a director of a quasipartnership company as if he had resigned as a director and refusing him access to certain financial information to enable him to ascertain whether an offer by the majority to buy his shares was
fair, the majorityâ€™s actions were unfairly prejudicial to his interests as a member under s 459 of the
Companies Act 1985 and the majority was ordered to purchase his shares under s 461 valued as
at the date of the court order at full value with no discount for the minority holding.
Held- allowing the appeal - (1) The unfair prejudice for which ss 459 and 461 provided a remedy
was that suffered in the capacity of a company member but a partner in a quasi-partnership company who had not been dismissed or excluded could not require his partners to purchase his
shares at a fair value simply because he had lost trust and confidence in them (dicta of Lord
Hoffmann in Oâ€™Neillv Phillips[1999] BCC 600 applied).
(2)In ruling that a consequence of the quasi-partnership was that L was entitled to the full undiscounted value of his shares, the judge appeared to have proceeded on the basis that it had been
P and O who had taken the initiative to sever the association rather than, as was the case, L. It was
true that P and O refused to recognise L as a director after 14 September 2000, or to give him
access to certain company information, but that was only after he had made plain that he wanted
to sever all relationship with the company and them and to take the value of his shareholding with
him. Accordingly it did not follow from the fact the company was a quasi-partnership that L was
entitled to insist on leaving with an undiscounted value of his minority holding, and the judge was
wrong so to find and, in large part on the basis of such finding, to conclude that P and Oâ€™s denial
of such entitlement amounted to unfair prejudice entitling L to relief.
(3)To the extent that L might have been unfairly prejudiced by lack of information as to the valuation of his interest in the company, his remedy under s 461(2)(b) would have been for the wrong
done in failing to furnish that information, not for the refusal to acknowledge his claim for a â€˜putoptionâ€™ for his shares.
(4)It was common ground that s 459 would afford protection to a member of a quasi-partnership
company who had been unfairly excluded from participating in the management of the company.
But that did not happen in the instant case; L made crystal clear in his resignation letter that he
wanted to sever all connection with the company and start a new life, with a new job, elsewhere.
In these circumstances it was impossible to place the instant case in that category of cases which
typically qualified for relief under s 459, where a member who wished to participate in the management of a company was unfairly prevented from doing so.
(5)The issue was whether s 459 extended to affording a member of a quasi-partnership company
who wished, for entirely his own reasons, to sever his connection with the company (and who de
facto had done so) an opportunity to â€˜putâ€™ his shareholding onto the other members as its full
undiscounted value when he had no contractual right to do so. There was no basis for concluding
that s 459 could have such an effect. Further, L could not assert his rights as a director, by complaining of a failure on the part of his co-directors to supply him with financial information to which
he was entitled as a director, in circumstances where it was plain that he had no intention whatever of discharging any of his duties as a director. The plain inference was that L was using his
position as a director simply as an aid to achieving as high a price as possible for his shares. Even
if unfair prejudice had been established by reason of the withholding of financial information to
which L was entitled as a director, the remedy which the judge granted - a buy-out of his shares
at their full, undiscounted, value - was wholly disproportionate to any possible prejudice suffered.
In Re Bird Precision Bellows [1984] 2 WLR 869 and again in Re London School of
Electronics[1985] 3 WLR 474, Nourse J said that the removal of a member from the board

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
was unfairly prejudicial conduct within what is now s 994, CA 2006. He made an order for the
purchase of the shares of the petitioners in both cases by the majority shareholders and
decided that in valuing the shares there should be no discount in the price because the holdings were minority holdings, unless the minority were in some way to blame for the situation
giving rise to the alleged unfair prejudice. Indeed, Nourse Jâ€™s approach for the valuation of
shares has become a popular view.
Re Bird Precision Bellows[1984] 2 WLR 869
The question in this case is whether the price of shares in a small private company which were
ordered to be purchased [...] should be fixed pro rata according to the value of the shares as a whole
or should be discounted on the ground that they constitute a minority in number [...] Although both
sections 210 and 75 are silent on the point, it is axiomatic that a price fixed by the court must be fair.
While that which is fair may often be generally predicated in regard to matters of common occurrence,
it can never be conclusively judged in regard to a particular case until the facts are known. The general observations which I will presently attempt in relation to a valuation of shares by the court under
section 75 are therefore subject to that important reservation.
Broadly speaking, shares in a small private company are acquired either by allotment on its incorporation or by transfer or devolution at some later date. In the first category it is a matter of common
occurrence for a company to be incorporated in order to acquire an existing business or to start a
new one, and in either event for it to be a vehicle for the conduct of a business carried on by two or
more shareholders which they could, had they wished, have carried on in partnership together.
Although it has been pointed out on the high authority to which I will soon refer that the description
may be confusing, it is often convenient and it is certainly usual to describe that kind of company as
a quasi-partnership. In the second category, irrespective of the nature of the company, it is a matter
of common occurrence for a shareholder to acquire shares from another at a price which is discounted because they represent a minority holding. It seems to me that some general observations
can usefully be made in regard to each of these examples [...]
I would expect that in a majority of cases where purchase orders are made in relation to quasipartnerships the vendor is unwilling in the sense that the sale has been forced upon him. Usually he
will be a minority shareholder whose interests have been unfairly prejudiced by the manner in which
the affairs of the company have been conducted by the majority. On the assumption that the unfair
prejudice has made it no longer tolerable for him to retain his interest in the company, a sale of his
shares will invariably be his only practical way out short of a winding-up. In that kind of case it seems
to me that it would not merely not be fair, but most unfair, that he should be bought out on the fictional
basis applicable to a free election to sell his shares in accordance with the companyâ€™s articles of
association, or indeed on any other basis which involved a discounted price. In my judgment the correct course would be to fix the price pro rata according to the value of the shares as a whole and without any discount, as being the only fair method of compensating an unwilling vendor of the equivalent
of a partnership share [...]
Next, I must consider the example from the second category of cases in which, broadly speaking,
shares in a small private company are acquired. It is not of direct relevance for present purposes, but
I mention it briefly in order finally to refute the suggestion that there is any rule of universal application to questions of this kind. In the case of the shareholder who acquires shares from another at a
price which is discounted because they represent a minority it is to my mind self-evident that there
cannot be any universal or even a general rule that he should be bought out on a more favourable
basis, even in a case where his predecessor has been a quasi-partner in a quasi-partnership [...]
In summary, there is in my judgment no rule of universal application. On the other hand, there is a
general rule in a case where the company is at the material time a quasi-partnership and the purchase
order is made in respect of the shares of a quasi-partner.

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
The dismissal of a member of a quasi-partnership from the post of director may amount
to unfairly prejudicial conduct if it breaches a mutual understanding that the member in
question would be a director (Re Ghyll Beck Driving Range Ltd [1993] BCLC 1126; Brownlow
v GH Marshall Ltd [2000] 2 BCLC 655; Shahv Shah[2010] EWHC 313 (Ch)). However, in
Re R A Noble (Clothing) Ltd, 1983 (see above), Nourse J decided that a director who had been
excluded from management could claim unfair prejudice but not in the particular circumstances of the case because his exclusion was to a large extent due to his own disinterest in the
companyâ€™s affairs so that the other members of the board felt that they had to manage without him. Similarly, if such an alleged breach of mutual understanding (legitimate expectation)
is undertaken with a view to protecting the company from that personâ€™s conduct which would
prove detrimental to the company (Gracev Biagioli [2005] EWCA Civ 1222) or that memberâ€™s misconduct which would impact on the companyâ€™s viability (Woolwichv Milne [2003]
EWHC 414 (Ch)), then the court will not regard such breaches as being unfair. More recently,
the case of Re Phoenix Contracts (Leicester) Ltd [2010] EWHC 2375 (Ch) highlighted the fact
that unfairly prejudicial conduct arose for the purposes of the s 994 CA where an individual,
who was one of two shareholders and executive directors and was also an employee of a company, was suspended and later made redundant after he contacted a potential customer of the
company and informed it that the company was being investigated by the Office of Fair
Trading. The court held that he could not be criticised for his actions and his exclusion from
the company was prejudicial to his interests as a shareholder.
In Re a Company (No 008699 of 1985)[1986] PCC 296, the High Court held that it was
unfairly prejudicial to minority shareholders where, on a takeover bid for the company, the
directors recommended acceptance of a bid by a company in which they had an interest while
ignoring a much more favourable alternative offer.
In Re Mossmain Ltd (1986)Financial Times, 27 June, four persons agreed to form a company. Two of these were husband and wife. Because the husband had a restrictive covenant in
a contract of employment which might be infringed if he became a member/director of the
company, his shares were held by his wife for the duration of the covenant, he becoming an
employee only for the time being. The wife was made a director. Later the husband was dismissed and his wife was removed from the board. Husband and wife petitioned under s 994
and the court held that the husbandâ€™s name must be struck out of the petition. He did not
qualify to petition since he was not a member as s 994 requires.
In Re a Company (No 007623 of 1984) [1986] BCLC 362 it was held that there was
no unfair prejudice where the company made a rights issue to all members pro ratato their
shareholding which the petitioner could not afford even though his interest in the company
after the issue would be reduced from 25 per cent to 0.125 per cent. The company genuinely
needed capital. The case can be contrasted with Clemensv Clemens Bros Ltd, 1976 where the
fresh issue of shares was not a rights issue offered to all members but to members other than
Miss Clemens in order to reduce her voting power in the company.
In certain circumstances, serious mismanagement of a company may justify the court
providing relief to a minority shareholder as per Re Macro (Ipswich) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 354,
in which Arden J stated:
All of these matters are within the responsibility of Thompsons as the companiesâ€™ managing
agent but they are attributable to the lack of effective supervision by Mr Thompson on behalf
of the companies. It is this conduct of the companiesâ€™ affairs by Mr Thompson which, in my
judgment, is prejudicial in the respects I have mentioned. As the conduct is prejudicial in a

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
financial sense to the companies, it must also be prejudicial to the interest of the plaintiffs as
holders of its shares...In my judgment, viewed overall, those acts are sufficiently significant
and serious to justify intervention by the court under s 461.
In Re London School of Electronics, 1985 (see above), Nourse J held that there was no overriding requirement under what is now ss 994-996, CA 2006 that the petitioner should come
to court with clean hands.
Finally, as seen in the case of Gamlestaden Fastigheter AB v Baltic Partners Ltd [2007]
UKPC 26 (Privy Council), the remedy for unfair prejudice may be used to protect the interests of creditors.
Gamlestaden Fastigheter ABv Baltic Partners Ltd[2007] UKPC 26
Lord Scott of Foscote observed:
Baltic is insolvent and the main issue for decision is whether it is open to a member of a company to
make an unfair prejudice application for relief in circumstances where, as here, the company in question is insolvent, will remain insolvent whatever order is made on the application and where the relief
sought will confer no financial benefit on the applicant quamember. The main relief now sought by
Gamlestaden on its art 141 application is an order under art 143(1) ordering the directors to pay damages to Baltic for breaches of the duty they owed to Baltic as directors. But it is accepted that the
damages, assuming the claim succeeds, will not restore Baltic to solvency. It will, however, if it does
succeed, produce a considerable sum which will be available to Balticâ€™s creditors. Gamlestaden,
either itself or as representing its parent company Gamlestaden AB, is a substantial creditor. The
indebtedness in question was a major part of Gamlestadenâ€™s investment in Balticâ€™s business ventures.
So, it is said, Gamlestaden has a legitimate interest, in the particular circumstances of this case,
justifying the making of the art 141 application.
The directors, however, applied to have the application struck out on the ground that it was bound
in law to fail. They contended before the Bailiff of the Royal Court and before the Court of Appeal, and
have repeated the contention before the board, that the alleged improprieties in the management of
Baltic of which Gamlestaden complain cannot be shown to have caused Gamlestaden any financial
loss in its capacity as sha reholder. Its loss, if any, is suffered as a creditor. An application under art
141 (or under s 459 of the 1985 Act) is, it is argued, a shareholderâ€™s remedy, not a creditorâ€™s remedy.
Once it becomes clear that the only benefit to be derived from the relief sought in an unfair prejudice
application would be a benefit to the companyâ€™s creditors, and that no benefit would be obtained by
the companyâ€™s shareholders, it becomes clear that the application is an abuse of process, cannot
succeed and should be struck out. The learned Bailiff agreed and struck out the application. The
Court of Appeal dismissed Gamlestadenâ€™s appeal. The point is now before the board for a final
decision. It must be emphasised that, since this appeal arises out of a strike out of the art 141 application, the facts pleaded in support of the application must be taken as true (save for any that can be
shown by incontrovertible evidence to be untrue). The Bailiff and the Court of Appeal approached the
case on that footing and so must their Lordships.
The point at issue depends, first, upon the scope of the power of the court under arts 141 and 143,
properly construed, in dealing with the unfair prejudice application and, secondly, upon the particular circumstances that are relied on for bringing this application within that scope...
The first question to be addressed, therefore, is whether an order for payment of damages to the
company whose affairs have allegedly been conducted in an unfairly prejudicial manner can be
sought and made in an unfair prejudice application....
There is nothing in the wide language of art 143(1) to suggest a limitation that would exclude the
seeking or making of such an order: the court â€˜may make such order as it thinks fit for giving relief in
respect of the matters complained ofâ€™.

Statutory protection against unfair prejudice
That leaves the important issue regarding Balticâ€™s insolvency. Here, too, it is appropriate to start
by noting the breadth of the art 143(1) discretion conferred on the court. The court â€˜may make such
order as it thinks fit for giving relief in respect of the matters complained of...â€™.
Bar the relatively trivial sum that Gamlestaden must have paid in subscribing for its 1,100 shares
in Baltic, Gamlestadenâ€™s investment took the form of the provision of loans to Baltic to enable
Baltic to fund SPK. Baltic was the corporate vehicle through which the joint venture enterprise of
Gamlestaden and Mr Karlsten of investment in German commercial property was to be pursued.
If mismanagement by the directors of that corporate vehicle has led to loss it seems to their Lordships
somewhat artificial to insist that the qualifying loss, for art 141 (or s 459) purposes, must be loss
which has reduced the value of the investorâ€™s equity capital and that it is not sufficient to show that it
has reduced the recoverability of the investorâ€™s loan capital...
Mr Moss Q.Câ€™s...submission comes to this, that it is a fatal and insurmountable bar in any and
every application for art 141 (or s 459) relief if the relief sought cannot be shown to be of some benefit
to the applicant shareholder in his capacity as shareholder.
Mr Moss supported his submission by reference, in particular, to the well-established rule that a
shareholder cannot petition for a winding-up order to be made in respect of a company that is insolvent. The reason is that the petitioning shareholder cannot obtain any benefit from the winding-up.
The companyâ€™s assets will be realised; dividends may be paid to creditors but nothing, if the company is insolvent, will go to the members. The rule that Mr Moss prays in aid is a long-established one
and one on which their Lordships cast no doubt. But there is a significant difference between a creditorâ€™s winding-up petition and an art 141 (or s 459) application. The former is seeking an order to put
the company into an insolvent liquidation that will affect the interests of all creditors as well as of all
members. It will involve the administration of the liquidation either by the Viscount [of the Royal Court
of Jersey] (or, in England, the official receiver) and his officials or by a professional liquidator who, in
carrying out his duties, will be an officer of the court. The liquidation, although from a financial point
of view carried out for the benefit of creditors, is a public act or process in which the public has an
interest. It seems to their Lordships quite right that a member with no financial interest in the process
or its outcome should be denied locus standito initiate the process.
Where relief is sought via an unfair prejudice application, on the other hand, the position is quite
different. There is no public involvement or interest in the proceedings, other than the natural interest
that may attend any proceedings heard in open court. The purpose of art 141, or of s 459, or of their
counterpart in Hong Kong, is to provide a means of relief to persons unfairly prejudiced by the management of the company in which they hold shares. If the company is a joint-venture company and
the joint venturers have arranged that one, or more, or all of them, shall provide working capital to the
company by means of loans, it would, in their Lordshipsâ€™ opinion, be inconsistent with the purpose of
these statutory provisions to limit the availability of the remedies they offer to cases where the value
of the share or shares held by the applicant member would be enhanced by the grant of the relief
sought. If the relief sought would, if granted, be of real, as opposed to merely nominal, value to an
applicant joint venturer, such as Gamlestaden, in facilitating recovery of some part of its investment
in the joint-venture company, that should, in their Lordshipsâ€™ opinion, suffice to provide the requisite
locus standifor the application to be made.
Mr Moss placed reliance on Re J E Cade & Son Ltd [1991] BCC 360 where Warner J refused
s 459 relief because the applicant was â€˜pursuing his interests as a freeholder of the farm and not his
interests as a member of the companyâ€™ (p 374C). But there was no counterpart in that case with the
feature in this case that the loans made by Gamlestaden were made pursuant to and for the purposes
of the joint venture to be carried on by Gamlestaden and Mr Karlsten via Baltic.
There are several cases in which judicial approval is given to affording a wide scope to s 459.
Some of these were referred to by Robert Walker J in R & H Electrical Ltd(supra)...And in Oâ€™Neill
v Phillips[1999] BCC 600 at p 612; [1999] 1 WLR 1092 at 1105 Lord Hoffmann said that: â€˜As cases
like R & H Electrical Ltdv Haden Bill Electrical Ltd[1995] BCC 958 show, the requirement that prejudice must be suffered as a member should not be too narrowly or technically construed.â€™
In their Lordshipsâ€™ opinion arts 141 and 143 properly construed do not ipso factorule out the grant
of relief simply on the ground that the relief sought will not benefit the applicant in his capacity as

Chapter 16 The protection of minorities
member. In many cases such a feature might justifiably lead to the refusal of relief...Their Lordships
do not accept that the benefit must be a benefit to Gamlestaden in its capacity as a shareholder but
they do accept that there must, where the only purpose of the application is to obtain payment
of a sum of money to Baltic, be some real financial benefit to be derived therefrom by Gamlestaden.
In particular, in a case where an investor in a joint-venture company has, in pursuance of the jointventure agreement, invested not only in subscribing for shares but also in advancing loan capital, the
investor ought not, in their Lordshipsâ€™ opinion, be precluded from the grant of relief under art 143(1) (or
s 461(1)) on the ground that the relief would benefit the investor only as loan creditor and not as member.
In the present case the provision of loan capital to Baltic seems to have been mainly, if not wholly,
made by Gamlestaden AB, rather than by Gamlestaden, although procured by Gamlestaden pursuant
to its obligation to do so under its joint-venture agreement with Mr Karlsten. But their Lordships, in
agreement with the view expressed by Robert Walker J in relation to similar arrangements made by
the applicant for s 459 relief in the R & H Electrical Ltdcase, conclude that that feature should not
bar Gamlestaden from relief under art 141.
Their Lordships take the view that the learned Bailiff and the Court of Appeal construed art 143(1)
too narrowly and that this appeal against the strike-out of Gamlestadenâ€™s art 141 application ought to
be allowed.
Minority petition for a just and equitable winding-up
The court has a jurisdiction under s 122(1)(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986 to wind up a company on the petition of a minority on the ground that it is â€˜just and equitableâ€™ to do so.
This ground is subjected to a flexible interpretation by the courts. In the context of minority rights, however, orders have been made where the managing director who represented the
majority shareholder interests in his management of the company refused, for example, to
produce accounts or pay dividends (Lochv John Blackwood Ltd[1924] AC 783) and where,
in the case of a small company, formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship,
involving mutual confidence and which is in essence a partnership, the person petitioning is
excluded from management participation and the circumstances are such as would justify the
dissolution of a partnership. This, it will be remembered, was the approach in Ebrahimi v
âž¨ See p. 29 Westbourne Galleries (see Chapter 1 âž¨). However, since the enactment of the unfair prejudice provisions and following the case of Re a Company (No 002567 of 1982)[1983] 2 All
ER 854 other matters have been brought to the fore. These are:
(a) that if the majority make an offer to buy out the shares of the director who has been
removed at a fair price, e.g. to be decided on by the companyâ€™s auditor, the court is not
perhaps likely to wind up the company because the ex-directorâ€™s capital is available by
other means. No such offer was made in Ebrahimiv Westbourne Galleries[1973] AC 360;
(b) that even if no such offer is made the better approach these days might be by petition
under the unfair prejudice provisions. The court can, as we have seen, order the purchase
of the ex-directorâ€™s shares, at a fair price, either by the other members or by the company
in reduction of capital.
However, the procedure through just and equitable winding-up is not specifically repealed
and there is no rule of law preventing that approach, and indeed it was held in Jesnerv Jarrad
(1992)The Times, 26 October, that a lack of unfair prejudice under s 944 (formerly s 459 of
the CA 1985) will not prevent the court from winding-up a company on the just and equitable

Essay questions
ground. In that case a family company was being run in good faith and without prejudice to
the claimant who was a family member. Nevertheless, the claimant and his brother and the
other members of the family had lost that mutual confidence required in what was really a
quasi-partnership, and on the basis of the Westbourne Galleries case it was just and equitable
that it should be wound up, given the disputes within the family as to how it should be run.
Further instances where the courts have considered that it was just and equitable to order
the winding-up of the company include cases where the company was promoted fraudulently
(Re London and County Coal Co(1866) LR 3 Eq 355); situations where there was a â€˜deadlockâ€™;
where the management and conduct of the company are such that it is unfair to require the
petitioner to remain a member (Re Five Minute Car Wash Service Ltd[1966] 1 All ER 242);
as well as cases where the company is a quasi-partnership and where there has been a
sufficiently serious breach of mutual understanding not expressed on the company constitution (Virdiv Abbey Leisure Ltd[1990] BCLC 342).
Finally, it is worth briefly mentioning that the â€˜winding-upâ€™ by the court commences on
presentation of the petition (s 129(2)) and as soon as a prayer for winding-up has been made,
the company becomes paralysed, resulting in the fact that no transactions relating to the companyâ€™s property can be entered into after this point. Consequently, this is a drastic course of
action and as such should be viewed as one of last resort for any minority shareholder. This
is reinforced by the fact that the court, under s 125(2), may refuse to grant a winding-up order
if it is of the opinion that (i) some other remedy is available to the petitioners; and (ii) the
petitioners are acting unreasonably by seeking to have the company wound up instead of
pursuing that other remedy.
There are other procedural limitations. A â€˜contributoryâ€™ has standing to make an application to the court with a view to obtaining the winding-up of the company (s 124). According
to s 79 of the Insolvency Act 1986, a contributory is any person who is liable to contribute to
the assets of a company in the event of its being wound up.
As this is an equitable remedy, the petitioner must come with â€˜clean handsâ€™ (Ebrahimiv
Westbourne Galleries), which may be contrasted with s 994 of the Companies Act 2006,
whereby the petitioner does not have to come with â€˜clean handsâ€™.

Directors and management - generally

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
The management of a company is usually entrusted to a small group of persons called
directors, supported, in the main, by the company secretary and the company accountant.
It should be noted that a private company does not have to have a secretary (CA 2006,
s 270(1)). Part 10 of the CA 2006 sets forth the provisions with respect to directors.
A company must have a board of directors numbering at least two in the case of a public
company; one will suffice in the case of a private company (CA 2006, s 154). The previous
exception for public companies registered before 1 November 1929 (or before 1 January 1933
in Northern Ireland) has been eliminated.
Apart from this, the number of directors and the way in which they are to be appointed
is left to be regulated by the articles. Given the fact that the articles of association used
âž¨ See p. 664 by the vast majority of companies, to date, will follow Table A (see Appendix 2 âž¨), this
chapter will continue to outline these provisions alongside those of the new Model Articles which apply to companies incorporated after 1 October 2009 (for further discussion
âž¨ See p. 95 see Chapter 4 âž¨). Table A (replaced by the new Model Articles in newly incorporated
companies) provides that unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution, the number of
directors (other than alternate directors) shall not be subject to any maximum but shall
âž¨ See p. 618 not be less than two. Table A, as well as the new Model Articles (see Appendix 1 âž¨), provides, in effect, that the company may from time to time by ordinary resolution increase
or reduce the number of directors, and determine in what rotation the increased number is
to retire.
Definition
Although the persons managing the company are usually called directors, other names are
sometimes used, e.g. managers, governors, or committee of management. In this connection
it is important to note the provisions of CA 2006, s 250 which are that the term â€˜directorâ€™
when used in the Act is taken to include any persons occupying the position of director by
whatever name called. Thus a director is anyone occupying the role of director regardless of
his title within the company. This could include a person not actually appointed to the board,
i.e. a de facto director. Thus, CA 2006, s 162 provides that the acts of a director are valid
regardless of any defect in his or her appointment and this must of necessity apply to de facto
directors (or directors in fact). A director is also an officer of the company.
It was held in Re Sykes (Butchers) Ltd[1998] 1 BCLC 110 that a person who denied that
he was a director and whose appointment had not been notified to Companies House could
nevertheless be disqualified as a de factodirector following various defaults, including a preference in which he paid off a bank overdraft with the companyâ€™s money to the detriment of
other creditors where he had guaranteed the overdraft. He then went on trading with the
company in a situation of inevitable insolvency. The court said that it was difficult to lay down
one decisive test of whether a person is a de factodirector. All the relevant facts relating to an
involvement in management must be considered.
However, in Secretary of State for Trade and Industryv Tjolle[1998] 1 BCLC 333 a woman
who called herself a director was not regarded as such for the purposes of disqualification
because, on the facts of the case, she had no involvement with anything financial and did not
form part of the companyâ€™s real governance.

Definition
Shadow directors
It should also be noted that s 251 extends certain provisions of the CA 2006 to a â€˜shadow
directorâ€™, being a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of
a company are accustomed to act unless the directors are accustomed so to act only because
the person concerned gives them advice in a professional capacity. Professional advisers
such as accountants and lawyers are not, therefore, for that reason alone, shadow directors.
However, those who give advice other than purely in a professional capacity may be included.
In Secretary of State for Trade and Industryv Deverell[2000] 2 BCLC 133 the Court of Appeal
gave a ruling that appears to extend the definition. The court said that the concepts of â€˜directionâ€™ and â€˜instructionâ€™ in the definition did not exclude the concept of the giving of advice.
The company concerned was in the travel business. It went into voluntary liquidation owing
creditors an estimated Â£4.46 million. Disqualification proceedings were brought against three
of its directors and two of its advisers or consultants who were persons with experience in the
travel business. The consultants were held to be shadow directors and disqualification orders
could be made against them.
Whether a person is or is not a shadow director is a matter of fact to be decided on the
circumstances of the case, but some indications are: (a) being a signatory to the companyâ€™s
bank account and/or attendance at interviews with bank officials; (b) the ordering by the
person concerned of goods and/or services for the company; (c) the signing of contracts and/or
letters in the capacity of director; (d) attendance at meetings of the board; (e) possession of
detailed information about the company.
The case of Secretary of State for Trade and Industryv Laing[1996] 2 BCLC 324 strengthens
and points to the fact that it is not easy to persuade a court that a person has acted either
as a shadow or de facto director. It is necessary to present to the court specific evidence of the
alleged â€˜directionsâ€™ given by the person concerned, plus evidence that they were acted upon
by the company to satisfy the test for a shadow director and, for a defacto director, that there
was a sufficient pattern of activities which could constitute acting as a de facto director. Thus
in Laing, one of the directors had actually signed a contract on behalf of the company but the
court concluded that this was not enough to make him a de facto director. The evidence did
not establish that he had continued to act as a director for a sufficiently long period of time
after that act.
The significance of being a shadow director is that such persons are caught by certain statutory provisions in the same way as a formally appointed or de factodirector. The provisions are:
(a) long-term service contracts;
(b) substantial property transactions;
(c) loans and similar dealings;
(d) interests in contracts made with the company;
(e) requirements relating to disclosures in the accounts;
(f) the rules relating to wrongful trading;
(g) entry on the register of directors and secretaries.
In addition, it is necessary for a company to keep, generally at its registered office, a copy
of any service contract made with a shadow director (see later in this chapter).
The CA 2006 statutory duties will apply to shadow directors where, and to the extent that,
the common law rules or equitable principles which they replace so apply (CA 2006, s 170(5)).

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
In other words, if there is a common law rule or equitable principle that currently applies to
a shadow director, the statutory duty replacing that common law rule or equitable principle
will also apply to the shadow director (in place of that rule of principle). However, where the
rule or principle does not currently apply to a shadow director, the statutory duty replacing
that rule or principle will not apply either. (For further discussion of directorsâ€™ duties refer to
âž¨ See p. 378 Chapter 19 âž¨)
Different types of director may exist on a single board. There may be full-time executive
directors employed for their expertise under a contract of service, e.g. a finance director.
Other non-executive directors may be appointed not to work full time under a contract of
service, but to give general advice and business skill and experience to the board or the goodwill attached to their name. They may also carry out a service for the company below board
level as in Buchanv Secretary of State for Employment(1997) 565 IRLB 2 where Mr Buchan
who was a director of Croydon Scanning Centre Ltd was also the operator of the scanner and
the sales manager.
Appointment of directors
Directors may be appointed in the following ways:
(i) By being named in the articles
This method is sometimes used for the appointment of the companyâ€™s first directors as an
alternative to following the procedure laid down in the articles.
(ii) By the subscribers to the memorandum
As we have seen, the subscribers (or subscriber in the case of a single-member company) to
the memorandum, or a majority of them, may appoint directors; and again this method is
sometimes used to appoint the first directors of the company.
However the first appointment is made, it is not effective unless the person concerned is
named in the statement of officers which is required by CA 2006, s 12. This statement which
is filed with other documents on incorporation must be signed by or on behalf of the subscribers (or subscriber) of the memorandum and must contain a consent signed by each of
the directors named in it to act in that capacity. Any appointment by any articles delivered
with the memorandum of a person as director is void unless he is named as a director in the
statement.
CA 2006, s 12 replaces CA 1985, s 10 and makes two modifications: first, directors now
have an option to withhold their home address from public access and, second, the requirement for private companies to have a secretary was eliminated.
(iii) By an ordinary resolution of the members in general meeting
In a public company the appointment of each director must be by a separate resolution, unless
the meeting resolves with no dissentients that a composite resolution appointing several
directors be put forward. This is to prevent the board from coercing members into voting for
the appointment of an unpopular director by putting him up for election along with others who
are more popular. The directors of a private company may by implication be appointed by a
composite resolution and the written resolution procedure could be used (CA 2006, s 160).

Appointment of directors
In addition, subject to any restrictions in the articles, which would be improbable, all
members of companies, whether public or private, can vote on a resolution for the election
of directors whether they are themselves directors or not (see: Article 17 of the new Model
Articles for private limited companies and Article 20 for public limited companies).
(iv) By the board of directors
The board may make appointments in two cases:
(a) to fill casual vacancies which may occur on resignation, disqualification, removal or death;
(b) to appoint additional directors up to a given maximum which may be set out in the companyâ€™s articles. Any such appointment in excess of the permitted maximum is void.
Persons appointed in these two ways usually hold office until the next annual general
meeting. However, if Table Aapplies the director concerned is not automatically eligible for
re-election. The usual procedure under Table A requires that the director concerned be
recommended by the board or that, before voting on the appointment the members have
received, usually with the notice of the meeting, details of the person to be appointed which,
if an appointment was made, would have to appear in the companyâ€™s register of directors
and secretaries. Private companies using the written resolution procedure would circulate
the relevant information.
Table A, Reg 78 gives the members a concurrent power to appoint directors to fill casual
vacancies and appoint additional directors, but this would involve the calling of a general
meeting unless the written resolution procedure was followed. The new Model Articles for
private companies is far more straightforward, with the process being covered by Article 17
âž¨ See p. 618 (see Appendix 1 âž¨).
Qualifications
No general qualifications are required in order to become a company director. However,
the Institute of Directors has introduced a professional qualification for directors. They are
called â€˜Chartered Directorsâ€™, and are able to use the letters â€˜CDirâ€™ after their names. There
is an examination and normally three yearsâ€™ board experience before obtaining the title.
Candidates also need a proposer and two seconders, and undergo a one-hour interview. After
reaching chartered status, directors have to submit to 30 hours of professional development
courses each year. The Institute of Directors also has power to discipline directors who fail to
keep up proper standards. The Institute is considering offering some form of accreditation
for non-executive directors. The object of the qualification is to enable qualified directors to
distinguish themselves from those without any recognised training, or from those who run
smaller companies, who may call themselves directors but who do not attend formal board
meetings with agendas and formal procedures as would be required in larger companies.
Contractual rights to appoint directors
If by a companyâ€™s articles directors are to be appointed by the members in general meeting,
the board cannot make a valid contract by which an outsider is empowered to appoint directors (Jamesv Eve(1873) LR 6 HL 335).
However, if the company is governed by Table A it seems that the board may delegate its
power to appoint additional directors and this may prove useful when the board wishes, for

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
example, to raise a loan or share capital from persons who are only willing to lend or invest if
they can nominate a certain number of directors to the board to protect their interests.
If the articles expressly empower an outsider to appoint directors, the power to do so is
undoubtedly valid, but whether the court would enforce the power by specific performance is
doubtful. Generally, the court will not enforce contracts of personal service in this way.
However, if the company refuses to accept an appointee in these circumstances there is, of
course, always the solution in a quasi-partnership company of asking for a winding-up. This
method was adopted in the following case.
Re A & B C Chewing Gum Ltd[1975] 1 All ER 1017
The petitioners, Topps Chewing Gum, held one-third of the ordinary shares in A & B C on the basis
of a shareholdersâ€™ agreement that they should have equal control with the two Coakley brothers,
Douglas and Anthony, who were directors of and held a two-thirds interest in the ordinary shares
of A & B C. In order to achieve equality of control, the company adopted a new set of articles which
allowed Topps to appoint and remove a director representing them in A & B C, and for board decisions to be unanimous. On the same day Topps, the Coakleys and A & B C signed and sealed
the shareholdersâ€™ agreement setting out the terms referred to above. Topps appointed Douglas
Coakley to represent them but later removed him and appointed John Sullivan, their marketing
director. Douglas and Anthony Coakley refused to accept the change so that Topps were effectively prevented from participating in management.
Held- by Plowman J - that it was just and equitable that the company be wound up under what
is now s 122(1)(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986. The Coakleys had repudiated the relationship in
the agreement and the articles. The case was one of expulsion and Westbourne Galleries (see
âž¨ See p. 29 Chapter 1 âž¨) applied. It is interesting to note that in applying Westbourne Galleries Plowman J
took the view that Lord Wilberforceâ€™s judgment spoke of entitlement to management participation
as being an obligation so basic that if broken the association must be dissolved, even though it is
not a company arising out of a partnership.
(i) Although Plowman J purported to be applying the equitable principles of Westbourne, he was
in fact merely enforcing the petitionerâ€™s contract rights set out in the shareholdersâ€™ agreement. He
could have granted an injunction to prevent the breach of that contract by the Coakley brothers,
a less drastic remedy than winding the company up.
(ii) Also less drastic, if return of share capital was required, would be an application to the court by
petition for unfair prejudice. It will be recalled that in Chapter 14 we gave cases in which the courts
had decided that in a private company, such as this was, it was part of the interest of a member
(such as Topps) to have a place on the board. Presumably this ruling would be applied to a corporate member in terms of entitling the company to have a nominee on the board where this has
been agreed.
Alternate directors
These can be useful if the director has many outside commitments which may from time to
time result in prolonged absences from the board. The appointment of an alternate can solve
problems relating to quorum, cheque-signing and so on. There is no statutory authority for
a director to appoint an alternate to act in his place in the event of his absence and alternate

Appointment of directors
directors can only be appointed if the articles so provide. Table A provides that any director
(other than an alternate director) may appoint any other director, or any other person
approved by the directors and willing to act, to be an alternate director and may remove from
office an alternate director so appointed by him. (This procedure is replicated in the new
âž¨ See p. 618 Model Articles for public limited companies - see Appendix 1 âž¨). An alternate director is
entitled to receive notice of all meetings of directors and of all meetings of committees of
directors of which his appointer is a member, to attend and vote at any such meeting at which
the director appointing him is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointer as a director in his absence but is not entitled to receive any remuneration from the company for his services as an alternate director. But it is not necessary to give
notice of such a meeting to an alternate director who is absent from the United Kingdom.
An alternate director ceases to be an alternate director if his appointer ceases to be a director, but, if a director retires by rotation or otherwise but is reappointed or deemed to have
been reappointed at the meeting at which he retires, any appointment of an alternate director
made by him which was in force immediately prior to his retirement continues after his
reappointment. Any appointment or removal of an alternate director is by notice to the company signed by the director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner
approved by the directors. Finally, and save as otherwise provided in the articles, an alternate
director is deemed for all purposes to be a director and is alone responsible for his own acts
and defaults and is not deemed to be the agent of the director appointing him.
An alternate director is a director of the company in his own right and his particulars
should be lodged with the Registrar if he is not already a director of the company. All the other
provisions relating to directors in company legislation apply to an alternate including, for
example, disclosure of interests in shares and debentures and material contracts.
Persons who cannot be appointed
This is to some extent a matter for the articles and they may, for example, provide that a
minor or an alien shall not be appointed a director of the company. Table Adoes not contain
any such restrictions, but the following statutory provisions apply.
(i) Age limit
CA 2006, s 157 requires that a person may not be appointed director of a company unless he
has attained the age of 16. One may be appointed director below the age of 16. However, one
may not serve as director until the age of 16 is reached. CA 2006, s 158 provides for certain
exceptions to s 157 of the CA 2006. CA 2006, s 159 requires that a person already a director
but is not the age of 16 as of the date CA 2006, s 157 comes into force (1 October 2008) must
cease to be a director. There is no statutory maximum age limit for a director.
(ii) Bankruptcy
The Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, s 11 makes it an offence for an undischarged bankrupt to act as a director of a company unless the court gives him the necessary
permission to act. If he has such permission, he may take up an appointment unless the
articles forbid his appointment with or without permission, in which case he cannot take
the appointment. Table Aprovides that a director who becomes bankrupt vacates office. The
article does not prevent the appointment of a director who is already bankrupt, but such an
appointment would not normally be made since the director could not act in that capacity.

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
The offence created by s 11 is one of strict liability which means that it does not require a
guilty mind. Therefore it is no defence for the director concerned to claim that he or she did
not realise that management functions were being performed.
Thus, in Rv Doring(2002) 33 LS Gaz R 21 the defendant said in her defence that she was
only concerned with publicity and design in regard to the products of Cabouchon Europe Ltd
of which she was a director. She said that she did not hire or fire staff or make financial decisions or contracts on behalf of the company. The judge directed the jury that since the offence
was strict they were not required to consider whether the defendant had acted dishonestly in
carrying out her duties (which she had not) but only whether her acts looked at objectively
amounted to being concerned in the management of the company. The jury found her guilty
and she was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. Her appeal to the Court of Appeal
was dismissed.
(iii) Persons disqualified by court order
The court may, and in some cases under s 6 of the 1986 Act must, make a disqualification
order. This is an order to the effect that a named person may not (unless the court gives leave)
perform any of the following activities during the period specified by the order:
(a) be a director (or liquidator, or administrator receiver, or receiver and manager) of a
(b) be concerned with or take part in, directly or indirectly, the promotion, formation or
management of a company (s 1 of the 1986 Act).
The 1986 Act requires the Registrar of Companies to keep a register of all persons against
whom disqualification orders are made and they remain on the register for the period in
which the order is in force. The register is open to inspection by members of the public.
(iv) Articles of association
Further disqualifications may be imposed by a companyâ€™s articles. Neither Table A nor the
Model Articles impose such disqualifications, merely specifying the grounds on which directors will vacate office. Thus, unless there are such express provisions, a person is not disqualified merely because he is a minor or an alien and a company may be a director of another
(v) Directors
Section 155 of the CA 2006 states that a company must have at least one director who is a
natural person.
Directors and employment law: generally
Directors may be fee-paid supervisors acting in some ways as trustees for the shareholders, or
senior executives or managers who work the whole time as directors of the company and who
sometimes combine this with the giving of a professional service to the company, as in the
case of an accountant who takes up an appointment as finance director. Under Table Adirectors are allowed to enter into service contracts which may be made by the board. They then
become known as executive directors.
Under Article 70 of Table Athe directors are empowered to enter into a service contract
with an executive director, provided that the term is not for more than five years when

Appointment of directors
member approval is required (see below). In addition, the normal procedures relating to the
appointment of the executive as a director must be followed.
In making the contract of appointment, the board must follow requirements of the companyâ€™s articles (see below).
UK Safety Group Ltdv Heane[1998] 2 BCLC 208
The problem in this case arose because of a failure by the directors to observe provisions in the
companyâ€™s articles. In this connection, the directors of the company can in general terms bind the
company and a third party in contractual rights and duties only if the provisions of the articles in
regard to contractual agreements are followed.
The main relevant article of UK Safety provided as follows in terms of the appointment of directors to an executive office. â€˜Any such appointment, agreement or arrangement may be made upon
such terms as the directors determine and they may remunerate any such director for his services
as they think fit.â€™
It appeared that an agreement between Mr Nicholas Heane as sales and marketing director
and UK Safety was made in effect by the chief executive of UK Safety, a Mr Newman, on his own
initiative and not by following the relevant article of the company. In evidence he said that he did
not feel it appropriate to discuss the terms at a board meeting but that the contract and its contents had been made known to, and approved by, the remuneration committee of the board - but
not the full board.
Mr Heane resigned to set up another company, which was the second defendant and UK Safety
was, in this action, seeking to enforce covenants in the alleged contract with Mr Heane restraining
his activities after leaving the company and in particular restraining his use of confidential information.
The judge accepted that it may not be necessary for a board to meet formally in order to transact business. He said:
I entirely accept [...] that it may not be necessary for a company to have a formal board meeting and,
consistently with the decision in Re Bonelliâ€™s Electric Telegraph Co, Cookâ€™s Claim (No 2)(1874) LR 18
Eq 656 it may be possible for all the directors informally to consider the terms of a contract [...] That,
however, is not what occurred in the present case. The initiative for the contracts came from
Mr Newman himself.
He went on to hold that the agreement with Mr Heane was not binding on him and, therefore, the
restraints were unenforceable.
It is all too easy for the directors of a busy company to neglect corporate formalities but this may
result in unfortunate consequences for the company, such as in this case an inability to protect the
companyâ€™s confidential information.
The case also makes clear that if the appointment is to the office of director or executive director
of a subsidiary approval by the group board is not enough. This, of course, does not mean that
the matter of the appointment by the subsidiary should not be raised with the group board in order
to satisfy corporate governance requirements.
The termination of the contract of service, of itself, does not terminate the directorship. It
is therefore advisable for the contract of service of an executive director to provide that the
director concerned will resign the directorship on termination of the contract of employment
for any reason. That failing, the director would have to be removed under a provision in the
articles, if any (there is no such provision in Table A) or under s 168 of the CA 2006.

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
Removal does not prevent the director concerned from bringing an action for damages for
wrongful dismissal. As regards claims for redundancy before employment tribunals, directors
who are employed under service contracts may have been engaged for a fixed term of two
years or more and may have been required in the contract to waive the right to claim for
redundancy.
However, from 1 October 2002 it has not been possible to make a contract of fixed-term
employment where the right to a redundancy payment is waived (see Fixed-Term Employees
(Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2034)).
It had been assumed that a director serving under a contract as an executive of the company could claim unfair dismissal. However in Cobley vForward Technology Industries plc
[2003] All ER (D) 175 the Court of Appeal ruled that the chief executive of a public listed
company was not unfairly dismissed when the shareholders removed him from office by a
resolution in general meeting. This effected his dismissal as CEO because his contract said that
he could not continue as CEO unless he was also a director of the company. His dismissal was,
ruled the court, â€˜for some other substantial reasonâ€™ under s 98 of the Employment Rights Act
1996. The removal followed a successful hostile takeover and business reorganisations are
capable of amounting to â€˜some other substantial reasonâ€™. The judgment notes that Mr Cobley
had reserved his right to claim at common law for wrongful dismissal by breach of contract.
This was not an issue before the Court of Appeal.
Presumably therefore where the company can establish one of the reasons justifying dismissal
under the 1996 Act, i.e. incapability, misconduct, redundancy, contravention of statutory
provision or â€˜some other substantial reasonâ€™ a claim for unfair dismissal will fail. Since removal from the board is a substantial reason as a â€˜business reorganisationâ€™ and presumably
always will be the claim for unfair dismissal seems ruled out. The statutory defence of substantial reason does not apply in wrongful dismissal claims though misconduct does. Claims
for wrongful dismissal can be brought before employment tribunals but there is a cap on the
award of Â£25,000. There is no cap in claims before the County Court or High Court.
Employee/directors may claim a redundancy payment (if they have not contractedout before 1 October 2002) or insolvency payment as a preferential creditor. The fees of an
officeholder/director are not so protected. Director/employees are also covered by the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976, the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 and regulations relating to discrimination on the grounds of sexual
orientation and religion or belief and employment legislation generally. The wider definition
of â€˜employeeâ€™ in the discrimination legislation brings within their scope directors who have a
contract for services, as where they contract with the company to act as a consultant.
Directorsâ€™ contracts of employment
As regards contracts of employment of directors, both public and private companies may not
incorporate into any agreement a term under which a directorâ€™s employment with the company or, if he is a director of a holding company, his employment with the group is to continue, or may be continued, except by the agreement of the members by ordinary (or written)
resolution, for a period that exceeds five years, if during that period the company cannot
terminate his contract by notice or his employment can be terminated by notice but only in
specified circumstances.

Appointment of directors
A contract for services is included and so the provisions relating to contracts of employment cannot be circumvented by directors who enter into long-term consultancy arrangements instead of contracts of employment. These arrangements could nullify to a large
extent the provisions of the CA 2006, s 168 in that directors could be removed from office
under that section but long-term arrangements which they may have given themselves could
involve massive compensation so that the company would, in practice, be unable to remove
The prohibition on long-term contracts applies to agreements between a director of a
holding company and any of its subsidiaries. Thus a director is prevented from avoiding the
provisions by entering into agreements with a company that is controlled by the company of
which he is a director.
There are provisions to prevent avoidance of the long-term contracts rules by the device
of entering into a series of agreements. Thus, if a director during the first year of a five-year
contract which cannot be terminated by notice enters into a further five-year contract which
cannot be terminated by notice, the period for which he is employed would be regarded as
10 years and, therefore, a term would be implied into both contracts making the employment
terminable by reasonable notice.
The provisions do not apply if the agreement continues after five years, but once five years
have passed, it can be terminated at the instance of the company by notice. In addition, a term
longer than five years may be valid if it has been first approved by a resolution of the company and in the case of a director of a holding company, by a resolution of that company also.
However, in such a case a written memorandum setting out the proposed agreement and
incorporating the term regarding length, must be available for inspection by the members of
the company at the registered office for not less than 15 days ending with the date of the meeting and also the meeting itself, or circulated in the case of a written resolution. Finally, the
provisions do not apply to contracts given to the directors of a wholly owned subsidiary. The
Act regards the subsidiary as a mere unit of management of the holding company so that the
directors of these management units can have their conditions of service settled by the directors of the holding company. If a director of a wholly owned subsidiary is also a director of
the holding company, any contract in excess of five years will be caught by the above provisions and will be affected unless one of the exceptions applies.
A contract which contravenes the above provisions is void and can be terminated by the
company at any time after reasonable notice. Reasonable notice is not defined by the Act but
in Jamesv Kent & Co Ltd[1950] 2 All ER 1099 it was held to be an implied term of a company directorâ€™s contract that he should be entitled to three monthsâ€™ notice.
Any term in the agreement, e.g. salary, which is distinct from the term relating to duration
is valid and enforceable.
Sections 188-189 of the CA 2006 require member approval of long-term service contracts.
Contracts under which a director is guaranteed at least two years of employment with the
company of which he is a director or with any subsidiary of that company are required to be
approved by members. The length of term was reduced from five years to two years for this
requirement.
The desirability of written contracts
As we have seen, executive directors can have a double function - one as an officer of the company and the other as an employee. However, the general attitude of the courts has been to

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
regard them as holders of an office rather than employees unless there is satisfactory evidence
to the contrary (see Eatonv Robert Eaton Ltd and Secretary of State for Employment[1988]
IRLR 83 and McLeanv Secretary of State for Employment(1992) 455 IRLIB 14). These cases
emphasise the general desirability of executive directors, particularly in small businesses,
having written contracts of service. Where this is so, the court would normally recognise
the employee aspect of the dual role and, in particular, allow claims to be made under s 166
of the Employment Rights Act 1996 to the Department of Trade and Industry (rebranded
the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) (DTI) for a redundancy
payment if the business goes insolvent. The written contract of service should not exclude
employment protection rights if it is for a fixed term. Once the DTI has made the payment,
the remedies of the employee against the employing company are transferred to the Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry for what they might be worth. The right of an employee to
apply directly to the DTI thus becomes very important in an insolvency situation. However,
this right only applies to employees and many directors of small family companies who are
acting in an executive role but without written contracts of employment may find themselves
without any financial recompense if the business fails.
Controlling members as employed directors
Before leaving the topic of directors as employees, it is worth mentioning that a director who
has a controlling interest in the shares of a company may not be regarded as an employee of
the company. Control is still a major factor in establishing a contract of employment and
a majority shareholder is not, as a worker, subject to any effective control by the company
(see Ottonv Secretary of State for Employment(1995) 7 February, EAT 1150/94). More recent
case law appears below. The provisions referred to above were then administered by the
Department of Employment.
Buchan vSecretary of State for Employment(1997) 565 IRLB 2
Mr Buchan was one of two working directors of Croydon Scanning Centre Ltd. He was also the
operator of the scanner and the sales manager and had a 50 per cent shareholding in the company. He worked full time for a salary of Â£35,000 pa and had an entitlement of five weeksâ€™ holiday
per year. He had no written contract of service and no written record of his engagement or conditions of service. The company went into administrative receivership and Mr Buchan tried unsuccessfully to obtain from the Secretary of State a redundancy payment from the National Insurance
Fund under ss 166 and 182 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. As we have seen, this course of
action is available to an employee where, for example, the employer is insolvent and the whole or
any part of a redundancy payment remains unpaid. If the Secretary of State makes a payment, he
takes over the employeeâ€™s rights and remedies in the insolvency.
An employment tribunal upheld the Secretary of Stateâ€™s decision and Mr Buchan appealed to
the EAT. The EAT dismissed Mr Buchanâ€™s appeal, concluding on the evidence that he was not an
employee. As beneficial owner of 50 per cent of the shares, he could block any company decisions
with which he did not agree, including decisions as to his own terms of service or dismissal. The
appointment of an administrative receiver did not and could not alter Mr Buchanâ€™s status within
the company. The EAT distinguished the case of Leev Leeâ€™s Air Farming Ltd[1960] 3 All ER 420
âž¨ See p. 10 (see Chapter 1 âž¨) where a controlling shareholder was held to be an employee. He was killed
while crop-spraying and a claim was brought against the company for workmenâ€™s compensation,
the company being indemnified in this respect by an insurance company. The claim succeeded

Appointment of directors
but the EAT did not think it would have done if it had been made under employment protection
legislation. Policy considerations were involved. Employment protection claims on insolvency are
met by the state and not by a company backed up by an insurer.
(i) The EAT followed this decision in a case heard contemporaneously with Buchan, i.e. Ivey v
Secretary of State for Employment(1997) 565 IRLB 2 where Mr Ivey was managing director owning 99 per cent of the company shares and also had a written contract. The two decisions were
then followed in Hefferv Secretary of State for Trade and Industry(EAT 355/96) where it was held
that an individual with a 70 per cent shareholding in the company was not an employee.
(ii) There was a further development in Flemingv Secretary of State for Trade and Industry(1998)
588 IRLB 10. The decision in Buchanhad carried the suggestion that there was a rule of law that
a controlling shareholder could never be an employee. That proposition was rejected by the Court
of Session in Fleming. The court held that the fact that a director holds a majority shareholding in
the company is a relevant factor in deciding whether he is or is not an employee for the purposes
of employment protection legislation but it is not in itself decisive. Nevertheless, the court held that
Fleming was not an employee because, even though he worked alongside the companyâ€™s employees, he was a majority shareholder and, in addition, had guaranteed the companyâ€™s debts. The
Flemingapproach was also approved by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry v Bottrill [1998] IRLR 120 where Morison J said that the reasoning in
Buchanand Iveywas â€˜unsoundâ€™.
(iii) The decision of the EAT was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for Trade
and Industryv Bottrill(1999) 615 IRLB 12. The Court of Appeal stated that whether or not a controlling shareholder could also be an employee can be decided only by having regard to all the
relevant facts. His controlling shareholding is likely to be a significant fact in all situations and in
some cases may be decisive. However, it is only one of the relevant facts and is not to be taken
as determining the relationship without taking into account all the relevant circumstances.
(iv) Following Bottrill, the EAT has ruled that a controlling shareholder of a company could be
regarded as an employee even though he stood to gain if the company did well. The fact that he
was a skilled entrepreneur was also irrelevant to the question of whether or not he was an
employee. He had a contract of employment with the company that was not a sham and he had
been treated and reward ed as an employee (see Connolly v Sellers Arenascene Ltd (2000) 633
(v) It seems that a director will be regarded as an employee where there is a written contract of
employment and all the usual hallmarks of employment are present. Certainly the original, almost
blanket, ban on controlling shareholders as employees has been considerably eroded.
Statutory employment claims
Directors are, in general, the best paid employees in a company and they have in the past
shown little interest in claims for unfair dismissal because of the existence of a cap on the
amount of compensation recoverable. This limit was increased under the Employment Rights
(Increase of Limits) Order 2008 in force from February 2009, to Â£66,200. Since a claim for
wrongful dismissal may be limited to the sum which the director would have received during
the relevant period of notice, there may be more claims by directors of smaller companies for
unfair dismissal where this can be sustained in the circumstances of the case.
However, in this context the decision of the Court of Appeal in Cobley and the comment
thereto should be noted.

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
Directorsâ€™ share qualification
The articles may require the directors to take up a certain number of shares as a share
qualification. The general purpose of this is said to be that, since they are to manage the companyâ€™s affairs on behalf of the other shareholders, they should have a stake in it themselves
to induce them to act diligently to ensure the companyâ€™s progress. However, since it is not
possible to ensure that directors have a beneficial interest in their qualification shares it seems
that no useful purpose is served by a requirement of qualification shares.
It is the duty of every director who is required to hold a share qualification, and who is not
already qualified, to obtain the necessary shares within two months after his appointment, or
such shorter time as may be fixed by the articles.
A director must be entered on the companyâ€™s register as the holder of his qualification shares,
but he need not hold them beneficially and could, for example, hold them on trust for others
so long as his name appears on the register of members in respect of them. A director is not
allowed to hold his qualification shares in the name of a nominee, since it would involve the
company receiving notice of trust which is forbidden by CA 2006, s 127. A director is not
qualified by holding a share warrant.
The modern trend is for articles of association not to require a share qualification for directors since it is now a generally held view that no useful purpose is served by the requirement.
It does, of course, help to ensure a quorum at general meetings, though it carries a distinct
risk that directors will become disqualified and therefore automatically vacate office, either by
transfer, or during the currency of a takeover bid, where they have accepted an offer in respect
of their own holdings.
It is almost certain that far more cases of disqualification occur than might be supposed
and that when the fact comes to light the directors concerned merely buy sufficient shares and
carry on as before. In fact, of course, having been disqualified, and thereby vacated office, they
ought to be reappointed by the board or the members as the case may be, but probably very
few are so reappointed and it is unlikely that CA 2006, s 162 can be relied upon. The section
does admittedly provide th at the acts of a director shall be valid, notwithstanding any defect
that may afterwards be discovered in his appointment or qualification. However, it is possible
that CA 2006, s 162 does not apply if there is no attempt at reappointment, though the rule
in Turquandâ€™s case may be of assistance. An unqualified person acting as director may be
fined for each day that he continues to act.
Division of power - directors and members
The board of directors and meetings of members of a company can between them exercise all
of the companyâ€™s powers. In a private company there is the option of a unanimous written
resolution of members. The distribution of those powers as between the members and the
directors is, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, left entirely to the discretion of
those who frame the articles of association.
The boardâ€™s powers can be as broad or as narrow as is desired, but if Table A, Reg 70
applies, then this confers on the board all the powers of the company, except those which the

Division of power - directors and members
Companies Acts and the articles require to be exercised by the members. Under the new
Model Articles, Article 3 confers the same powers for both public and private limited com-
âž¨ See pp. 618 panies (See Appendix 1 âž¨).
and 635 The powers reserved to the members by the Companies Acts are mainly the power to alter
the memorandum and articles, the power to alter share capital, the power to appoint auditors
âž¨ See p. 94 and remove directors and the power to put the company into liquidation (see Chapter 4 âž¨).
Additionally, Table A reserves to the members the power to fix the rights to be attached to a
new issue of shares and to effect variations of such rights, the power to appoint directors and
the power to declare dividends, though not in excess of the percentage recommended by the
board, and to capitalise profits and reserves.
In addition, directors of public and private companies must have the authority of the
members by ordinary resolution in general meeting, or written resolution, or of the companyâ€™s articles, before they exercise a power of allotment of shares or grant rights to subscribe
for, or convert securities into, shares. Furthermore, public and private companies must offer
new shares to existing members before they are allotted to others. However, a private company may exclude this requirement by its memorandum or articles or by special (or written)
resolution and a plc may achieve the disapplication of pre-emption rights by a special resolution of its members.
Concurrent powers
Certain powers, even though given to the directors, will be regarded as concurrent and exercisable by the members unless the articles make it clear that the power is exclusive to the
directors. Thus a power for directors to appoint additional directors and to fill casual vacancies on the board or to fix the remuneration of the managing director will be treated as concurrent powers, unless the articles clearly show that it is to be exclusive to the directors (which
Table Adoes not) and so resolutions passed by the members in respect of such matters will
prevail over the directorsâ€™ own decision. Although the directors have power to sue in the companyâ€™s name, there is also a concurrent power in the members so that if the board decides not
to sue in a particular cas e the members may by ordinary resolution resolve that the company
shall sue.
Control of the companyâ€™s business
If the members are dissatisfied with the way in which the directors are running the companyâ€™s
business, there are the following ways in which the members can deal with the situation:
(a) by overriding decisions of the board by ordinary (or written) resolution where the power
is concurrent. Thus if the directors have refused to bring a claim to court on behalf of the
company the members may initiate it by ordinary (or written) resolution; or
(b) by altering the memorandum by special (or written) resolution to take away the companyâ€™s capacity to continue the activity concerned; or
(c) by altering the companyâ€™s articles by a special (or written) resolution so as to cut down
the directorsâ€™ powers; or
(d) by refusing to re-elect directors of whose actions they disapprove. The procedure would
involve replacing the directors by others with different policies and this would require an
ordinary (or written) resolution; or

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
(e) by recourse to the provisions of CA 2006, s 169, which provides that a company may
by ordinary resolution remove a director before the expiration of his period of office,
notwithstanding anything in the articles or in any agreement between the company and
him. Such a resolution requires special notice of 28 days to be given to the company of the
intention to propose it. The section does not deprive a director so removed of any claim
he may have for damages or compensation payable to him as a result of the termination
of his appointment. The section would be satisfied by a majority of one, but a small
minority would be unlikely to succeed in carrying such a resolution, and removal may be
impossible if the directors have weighted voting rights on the resolution to remove them
(Bushellv Faith, 1969). Company legislation does not allow the use of a written resolution by private companies for removal of directors.
In addition, Pedleyv Inland Waterways, 1977 decides that a minority wishing to remove
a director must be of sufficient size to comply with CA 2006, ss 314 and 315 (if the directors are to be compelled to put a resolution on the agenda for removal at an AGM), or
CA 2006, s 303 (if the directors are to be required to call an extraordinary general meeting to consider the removal);
(f) where there is a regulation such as Article 70 of Table A, the members may give a direction
by a special (or written) resolution under which the directors are required to act differently
for the future. Article 70 provides that subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the
memorandum and the articles, and to any directions given by special resolution, the business of the company shall be managed by the directors who may exercise all the powers
of the company. (This is replicated in Article 3 of the new Model Articles for both public
âž¨ See pp. 618 and private limited companies - see Appendix 1 âž¨.) No alteration of the memorandum
and 635 or articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would
have been valid if that alteration had not been made or that direction had not been given.
Directorsâ€™ irregular acts - validation
Directors who carry out acts which are initially defective can have them validated by an
ordinary (or written) resolution. If the transaction is ultra vires the company, a special (or
âž¨ See p. 94 written) resolution is required (see Chapter 4 âž¨).
Grantv United Kingdom Switchback Railways Co(1888) 40 Ch D 135
The articles of association of Thompsonâ€™s Patent Gravity Switchback Railways Co (the second
defendant) disqualified any director from voting at a board meeting in regard to any contract in
which he was interested. The directors of Thompsonâ€™s agreed to sell the companyâ€™s undertaking
to the United Kingdom Co (the first defendant) despite the fact that they were also the promoters
of the purchasing company. An action was brought by a shareholder in Thompsonâ€™s for an injunction to restrain Thompsonâ€™s from carrying into effect the contract of sale on the grounds that they
had no authority to enter into it since the articles prohibited a director from voting upon a contract
in which he was interested, and here all the directors but one were interested. However, it
appeared that a general meeting of the shareholders of Thompsonâ€™s had been properly held and
that they had passed an ordinary resolution approving and adopting the agreement and authorising the directors to carry it into effect.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that the contract was valid and an injunction was refused.

Division of power - directors and members
The directors cannot cure acts which are in breach of their fiduciary duty to the company
by obtaining an ordinary resolution of the members in general meeting if they control the
âž¨ See p. 289 voting at general meetings (Cookv Deeks, 1916, see Chapter 15 âž¨) or possibly control general meetings in fact, even though they do not have a majority of voting shares (Prudential
âž¨ See p. 276 Assurancev Newman, 1980, see Chapter 14 âž¨).
A unanimous written resolution would presumably cure such acts in the sense that there
would be no member wishing to object. However, in a situation of insolvency the creditors,
through an insolvency practitioner, may wish to contest the validity of a written resolution as
a cure for the directorsâ€™ breach of duty.
Delegation of powers by the directors
The well-known maxim of the law of agency - â€˜delegatus non potest delegareâ€™ (a delegate cannot delegate) - applies to directors, so that they cannot delegate their functions and powers to
others without the permission of the members or the articles. Articles do usually allow delegation of powers to a committee of the board (as per Table A and the new Model Articles),
though such delegation is revocable even if made for a fixed period of time (Manton v
Brighton Corporation[1951] 2 All ER 101). Table A also allows delegation to any managing
director or any director holding any other executive office of such of the directorsâ€™ powers as
they consider desirable to be exercised by him.
In addition, Table A also allows the board to employ agents and professional persons to carry
out any functions which the board may itself carry out. In many respects this is covered by
âž¨ See p. 664 Article 5 of the new Model Articles for public and private companies - see Appendix 2 âž¨).
Board unable or unwilling to act
This situation may arise in the following circumstances:
(a) Where the act is beyond the powers of the board
Authority for the transaction must be sought from the members in general meeting and the
authorisation may be given by ordinary (or written) resolution.
The members may authorise directors to do an act which is outside the directorsâ€™ own
powers, but within the companyâ€™s power, by passing an ordinary (or written) resolution
either before or after the directorsâ€™ act (per Bowen LJ in Grantv United Kingdom Switchback
Railways Co, 1888, see above). In such a situation the members can, of course, revoke or vary
the authority by ordinary (or written) resolution at any time. It is only necessary to amend
the articles if the members wish to add the particular power to the powers of the board.
(b) Lack of quorum at board meetings
Directors may be unable to exercise the powers given to them by the articles because they have
become so few in number that they cannot constitute a quorum, or because so many of them
are, in a legal sense, interested in the transaction in question and are consequently disabled
from voting by the articles, that a quorum of competent directors cannot be found.
As regards quorum, Table A empowers the remaining directors to fill vacancies so as to
make up a quorum (this is replicated in Article 11 of the new Model Articles). If there are no
directors at all, or if the remaining directors are unwilling to fill the vacancies, the members
may exercise their powers until a board is properly constituted.

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
When a quorum of competent directors (i.e. directors who are not interested in the
transaction) cannot be found, the boardâ€™s powers temporarily revert to the members who
may then authorise the remaining directors to act either in advance of their acting or by
ratification afterwards.
(c) The proper purpose rule
If directors are unable to exercise their powers in a lawful manner because to do so would
be a breach of their duty to exercise those powers for the purpose for which they were given,
i.e. for the benefit of the company (alternatively expressed as the proper purpose rule), the
members may by ordinary (or written) resolution ratify what the directors have in fact done
(Bamfordv Bamford[1969] 2 WLR 1107), and it would seem that they may also authorise the
directors in advance to do the act in question (Bamford v Bamford, 1969, per Russell LJ).
It appears from cases such as North-West Transportation Co Ltdv Beatty(1887) 12 App Cas
589 that the directors are not under any legal duty to abstain from voting in order to achieve
ratification or authorisation.
If there is no such ratification or authorisation by the members and the act of the board
contravenes the proper purpose rule, it is invalid.
It is important to note that directors may fall foul of the proper purpose rule even when
they are exercising a power for the benefit of the company.
Gallowayv HallÃ© Concerts Society[1915] 2 Ch 233
The defendant society was registered in 1899 as a company limited by guarantee without the addition of the word limited to its name, as being formed for the promotion of art and with the intention that its profits should be applied in promoting its objects without payment of dividends to its
members. Its object was the promotion of concerts known as the â€˜HallÃ© Concertsâ€™ in Manchester.
Under the provisions of the memorandum each member was to contribute on a winding-up such
amount as should be required to pay the companyâ€™s liabilities, not exceeding Â£5 per member.
Article 7 of the companyâ€™s articles provided that each member should be liable to contribute, and
should pay on demand to the society, any sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate Â£100
(called the contribution) as and when called. The claimants, Galloway and Holt, were members of
the society but disagreed with certain of its policies. They objected to calls being made upon them
in respect of the contribution and had not paid previous calls made, although one such call had
been recovered by the society in a county court. On 31 March 1915, the committee of the society
resolved to call up the whole of the contributions of Galloway and Holt, but no corresponding call
was made on the other members. The claimants sought a declaration that the resolution was
invalid and the call unenforceable.
Held- by Sargant J - there is an implied condition of equality between shareholders in a company,
and it is generally improper for directors to make a call on part of a class of members without
making a similar call on all the members of the class. Further, even if the articles give power to discriminate, the fact that the members are dilatory in paying previous calls would not be sufficient
reason for enforcing a discriminatory power in the articles.
(i) It should be noted that the act of making the call was not in any sense beyond the powers of
the directors and was even in a sense exercised for the benefit of the company because, having
called up the whole of the share capital of Galloway and Holt, they could have been sued once and
for all for its recovery if they had not paid it. However, in spite of the fact that the directors had the

The chairman and executive directors
power and were probably motivated in the companyâ€™s benefit, the power was not exercised for the
proper purpose and was struck down for this reason.
(ii) More commonly perhaps the proper purpose rule is used where the directors have used
their powers for a purpose which does not benefit the company as in the Rolled Steelcase (see
âž¨ See p. 129 Chapter 6 âž¨).
(d) Dissension between members of the board
If directors are unable to act because of a dissension between themselves, the members
may exercise the powers of the board until a board is elected which can act. However, the
dissension must result in deadlock before the members can intervene. It must, for example,
be shown either that so many directors persistently absent themselves from board meetings
that a quorum cannot be found, or that the dissenting parties have equal voting power at
board meetings and resolutions cannot therefore be passed.
(e) Powers of the court
Where the board is unable to act because the directors are so few in number that a quorum
cannot be found, or because of deadlock between the directors, the court may appoint a
receiver of the companyâ€™s business to manage it until a competent board can be constituted.
Furthermore, if the power of the board which the members wish to have exercised is one
which the court can conveniently exercise itself, the court may exercise the power and give
any decision which the board could have given (see Re Copal Varnish Co Ltd[1917] 2 Ch 349
where the court exercised a power to approve the transfer of shares).
The chairman and executive directors
Consideration will now be given to the special position of the chairman and executive directors.
Companies are not required by the law to appoint a chairman and, given the fact that the
requirement for a private company to hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) has been
abolished by the Companies Act 2006, there would appear to be little need for a chairman to
âž¨ See p. 379 control proceedings (see further Chapter 19 âž¨).
However, a chairman is appointed. Table A gives the board specific power to appoint a
chairman of the board and states that the chairman of the board shall preside as chairman of
general meetings, though provisions are made in each case for the chairmanâ€™s absence and in
practice a deputy chairman is often appointed. This approach has been repeated in Article 12
âž¨ See p. 618 of the new Model Articles for private and public limited companies - see Appendix 1 âž¨).
The chairman is normally regarded as a non-executive director even though he may
be closely involved with the affairs of the company. Where he is in receipt of fees and is not
employed at a salary but is concerned solely with running the board and representing the
company as a figurehead, he is properly described as a non-executive director. However,
he may not qualify as an â€˜independentâ€™ director where such independence may be required.
There is in recent times a tendency to refer to non-executive directors as â€˜outside directorsâ€™
and in many cases the chairman would not truly fit that description.

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
Managing director
It is usual to make one or more of the full-time directors managing director (or directors) and
to give him powers relating to the management of the business which are exercisable without
reference to the full board.
Before such an appointment can be made, the articles must so provide. Table A provides
for the appointment of a member of the board to the office of managing director, and further
states that he shall not be subject to retirement by rotation, but that he shall cease to be a managing director if for any other reason he ceases to be a director, e.g. where he is removed or
âž¨ See p. 94 becomes disqualified (Southern Foundries v Shirlaw, 1940, see Chapter 4 âž¨). Thus, under
Table A, a managing director must also be a director, as must the chairman of the board. Table
A allows the directors to fix the managing directorâ€™s remuneration and in Article 72 allows the
board to delegate any of their powers to him, subject to a right to review these powers from
time to time. Where the articles are in the form of Table A, then the managing director is
not wholly independent of the board, as he will be if his powers are outlined expressly in the
articles. In practice, Table Agives the board flexibility to give a managing director a specific
portfolio of powers and review the situation from time to time.
The fact that Article 72 allows the board to delegate any of its powers to the managing
director has given the holder of such office wide ostensible or usual authority as an agent on the
assumption perhaps by the outsider that the relevant powers have been delegated. This means
that the managing director may bind the company, at least in business contracts, even where
he exceeds actual authority. However, the case of Mitchell & Hobbs (UK) Ltdv Mill[1996] 2
BCLC 102 decides that such ostensible or usual authority does not extend to instructing solicitors to commence an action on behalf of the company without the consent of the board.
It is worth noting that the new Model Articles for public and private limited companies do
not make specific provision for the role of managing directors. However, it is arguable that
the broad wording of Article 5, coupled with Article 19 for private companies or Article 23 for
public companies, may permit companies to pursue a similar course of management of the
âž¨ See p. 618 companyâ€™s affairs as that set down by Article 72 of Table A(see Appendix 1 âž¨).
Appointment of directors to executive posts
Under Table A the directors may appoint one or more of their number to any executive office,
e.g. finance director, under the company and may enter into an agreement or arrangement
with any director for his employment by the company or for the provision by him of any
services outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a director. Any such appointment, agreement or arrangement may be made on such terms as the directors determine, and they may
remunerate any such director for his services as they think fit. Any appointment of a director
to an executive office will terminate if he ceases to be a director but without prejudice to any
claim for damages for breach of the contract of service between the director and the company.
A director holding executive office is not subject to retirement by rotation.
Furthermore, the board may delegate to any director holding executive office such of their
powers as they consider desirable to be exercised by him. Any such delegation may be subject
to any conditions the directors may impose and either collaterally with, or to the exclusion of,
their own powers may be revoked or altered. This extension of the power of delegation to
directors holding executive office may well have increased their ostensible or usual authority
âž¨ See p. 129 (see further Chapter 6 âž¨).

Publicity in connection with directors
Publicity in connection with directors
Certain provisions of the Companies Act 2006 are designed to make available details regarding
the executive of the company which may be of assistance to members and persons dealing
with it. The following should be noted:
(a) The register of director
The company must keep at its registered office a register of directors and secretaries and
must notify the Registrar of any changes within 14 days of the happening thereof (CA 2006,
The contents of the register as to directors are set forth in s 163 of the CA 2006 and include:
(i) present name and nationality;
(ii) any former name;
(iii) a service address which may be stated to be â€˜The companyâ€™s registered officeâ€™;
(iv) business occupation (if any);
(v) date of birth;
(vi) the country or state (or part of the United Kingdom) in which he is usually resident.
The register must be open to inspection by members free and to other persons on payment
of a fee. Shadow directors are included in the above provisions.
CA 2006, s 165 covers the present status with respect to the use of directorsâ€™ residential
address which is a noted change from the CA 1985 position.
A service address must have a physical presence which excludes a Post Office box number
but does not preclude the use of the companyâ€™s registered office as the service address.
(b) Trade catalogues and circulars
Every company registered on or after 23 November 1916 must state on all letter headings, on
which the companyâ€™s name appears, the names of all their directors or none of them. This does
not apply to a name quo ted in the text of a letter or to the signatory. Companies incorporated
before 23 November 1916 do not come within these provisions and may, if they wish, show
some and not all of the names of the directors.
(c) Register of directorsâ€™ interests in shares and debentures
The provisions relating to this register were considered previously.
(d) Inspection of directorsâ€™ service contracts
Every company must keep a copy of each of its directorsâ€™ service contracts at its registered
office or at its principal place of business in England, Scotland or Wales (depending on where
it is registered), or the place where its register of members is kept.
If a director has no written contract, a written memorandum of the terms on which
he serves must be kept instead. This means, in practice, that directors are given written
contracts if they are employed (or executive) directors. There is little point in employing a
director under an oral contract if it is necessary, as it is, to draft a written memorandum of
its terms.
The copy or memorandum must show all changes in the terms of the contract made since
it was entered into.

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
The company must notify the Registrar of Companies where the copies or memoranda of
its directorsâ€™ service contracts are kept unless they are kept at its registered office.
There is no need for a copy or memorandum to be kept if the contract has less than
12 months to run, or if it can be brought to an end by the company within that time without
payment of compensation.
Members of the company may inspect such copies or memoranda without charge. If
inspection is refused, the person wishing to inspect the contract may apply to the court which
will make an order compelling inspection.
The intention of the above provisions is to assist members who wish to remove a director
under s 168 of the CA 2006. This publicity enables members to see what the cost of removal
The CA 2006 also provides that:
(i) A directorâ€™s service contract with a subsidiary (or a memorandum of it if it is not in
writing) must also be open for inspection.
(ii) The contractof a director who works with the company or a subsidiary wholly or mainly
outside the United Kingdom need not be available for inspection. In such a case there
need only be available for inspection a memorandum containing:
(a) the directorâ€™s name;
(b) the name and place of incorporation of the subsidiary (if any) with which the contract is made; and
(c) the provisions in the contract as to its duration.
(iii) Shadow directors, i.e. persons other than professional advisers, in accordance with
whose instructions directors of a company are accustomed to act, are to be treated as
directors for the purposes of this section.
The secretary
The CA 2006 sets forth a statutory basis for a company secretary. Part 12 of the CA 2006 deals
with company secretaries and draws a distinction between the role of the secretary in the
private company and the public company. There are common provisions that are applicable
to both the private and public company secretary. The status of the company secretary has
been greatly diminished under the CA 2006 for the private company.
A secretary owes fiduciary duties to the company which are similar to those of a director.
Thus he must not make secret profits or take secret benefits from his office and if this happens
he can be required to account for them to the company as a constructive trustee (Re Morvah
Consols Tin Mining Co, McKayâ€™s Case (1875) 2 Ch D 1).
The criminal law regards him as an organ of the company and a higher managerial
agent whose fraudulent conduct can be imputed to the company in order to make it
liable along with him for crimes arising out of fraud and the falsification of documents
and returns.
Under CA 2006, s 270, a private company need not have a company secretary (though
the new Model Articles do, nevertheless, make several references to the post of â€˜secretaryâ€™).
Under CA 2006, s 271, a public company must have a secretary. CA 2006, s 273 sets forth the

The secretary
qualifications of the secretaries of public companies. A public company must keep a register
of secretaries. There is no requirement that a company secretary be a natural person.
Appointment
It is usual for the secretary to be appointed by the directors who may fix his term of office and
the conditions upon which he is to hold office. Table A confers such a power upon the board
together with the power to remove him. The secretary is an employee of the company. He is
regarded as such for the purpose of preferential payments in liquidation (Insolvency Act 1986,
s 175 and Sch 6). The secretary is also within the CA 2006, s 1173â€™s definition of â€˜officerâ€™ of a
The civil courts now recognise that the modern secretary is an important official who enjoys
the power to contract on behalf of the company, even without authority. This is, however,
confined to contracts in the administrative operations of the company, including the employment of office staff and the management of the office together with the hiring of transport (Panorama Developments (Guildford) Ltd v Fidelis Furnishing Fabrics Ltd, 1971, see
âž¨ See p. 129 Chapter 6 âž¨). However, his authority is not unlimited. He cannot without authority borrow
money on behalf of the company (Re Cleadon Trust Ltd [1939] Ch 286). He cannot without
authority commence litigation on the companyâ€™s behalf (Daimler Co Ltdv Continental Tyre
and Rubber Co Ltd[1916] 2 AC 307). He cannot summon a general meeting himself (Re State
of Wyoming Syndicate [1901] 2 Ch 431) nor register a transfer without the boardâ€™s approval
(Chida Mines Ltdv Anderson(1905) 22 TLR 27) nor may he without approval strike a name
off the register (Re Indo China Steam Navigation Co [1917] 2 Ch 100). These are powers
which are vested in the directors.
Certain duties are directly imposed upon the secretary by statute. These include the submission of certain statutory declarations, e.g. before commencing business, in order to obtain

âž¨ See p. 554 to an administrator and administrative receiver respectively (see further Chapter 25 âž¨).
Qualifications of the secretary of a public company
CA 2006, s 273 updates the requirements of a public company secretary. It is the duty of the
directors of a public company to take reasonable steps to secure that the company secretary or
each joint secretary, where appropriate, has the requisite knowledge and experience and
comes within one of the following categories:
(a) He has been the secretary of a public company for at least three out of the five years
immediately preceding his appointment as secretary.
(b) He is a member of either the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales, or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, or the Association of

Chapter 17 Directors and management - generally
Chartered Certified Accountants, or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland,
or the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, or the Chartered Institute
of Management Accountants, or the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy.
(c) In addition, he will be suitable if he is a barrister, or an advocate, or a solicitor who
qualified in the UK. Furthermore, a person who â€˜by virtue of his holding or having held
any other position or his being a member of any other body, appears to the directors to
be capable of dischargingâ€™ the duties and functions of a secretary is also acceptable.
Thus, the directors of a public company may appoint a person who does not hold any of
the specified formal qualifications.
It would seem that the duty of the board in regard to the secretaryâ€™s qualification is a continuing one. Thus, if the secretary, being a member of one of the professional bodies listed,
was struck off, then the directors would probably have to reconsider his position.
The word â€˜personâ€™ in the above provisions includes a company.
Table A allows the directors to remove the secretary before his term of office has expired but,
depending on the circumstances, the secretary will retain a right to sue for damages for breach
of his contract, provided that this was a separate contract and not merely contained in the
âž¨ See p. 94 articles (see further Chapter 4 âž¨).
Assistant and deputy secretary: joint secretaries
Statutory recognition of these offices is given by CA 2006, s 274, the relevant part of which
provides â€˜Anything required or authorised to be done by or to the secretary may, if the office
is vacant or there is for any other reason no secretary capable of acting, be done by or to any
assistant or deputy secretaryâ€™.
Special articles may delegate the power to appoint assistant or deputy secretaries to the
secretary. Otherwise the a ppointment and removal can be effected by the board in the same
way as for the secretary but there is no need to notify appointment, removal or resignation
to Companies House. Companies which have joint secretaries are required to give details
of them in the register of directors and secretaries and notify Companies House of any
appointments and changes in particulars within 14 days of the occurrence.
The company accountant
The accountant is an officer of the company. He owes a contractual duty to the company to
prepare the accounts properly and like the auditor may, in some cases, owe a duty of care to
third persons who act in reliance on his skill in their preparation. Seemingly, the accountant
can acknowledge a debt on behalf of the company (Jonesv Bellgrove Properties[1949] 2 All

Financial arrangements with,
and fair dealing by, directors

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
In this chapter we shall first consider those provisions of company law which relate to
payments to directors, e.g. by way of remuneration and compensation for loss of office.
Consideration will then be given to requirements relating to transactions with directors and
persons connected with them which provide a legal safeguard against directors abusing their
position in the company.
Remuneration
If a director is to receive remuneration by way of fees, the articles must expressly provide for
it, and in the absence of such provision, no remuneration is payable even if the members
resolve in general meeting that it shall be (Re George Newman & Co[1895] 1 Ch 674). Their
proper procedure is to alter the articles or give the director concerned a contract so that he no
longer relies on fees.
The Model Articles for Private Companies Limited by Shares, the Model Articles for
Private Companies Limited by Guarantee and the Model Articles for Public Companies set
forth the regulations concerning directorsâ€™ remuneration in their respective Article 19for the
two kinds of private companies and Article 23 for public companies. Directors may undertake
any services for the company that the directors decide. Directors are entitled to such remuneration as the directors determine: (a) for their services to the company as directors, and (b)
for any other service which they undertake for the company. A directorâ€™s remuneration may
(a) take any form, and (b) include any arrangements in connection with the payment of a
pension, allowance or gratuity, or any death, sickness or disability benefits, to or in respect of
that director. Unless the directors decide otherwise, directorsâ€™ remuneration accrues from day
to day. Unless the directors decide otherwise, directors are not accountable to the company
for any remuneration which they receive as directors or other officers or employees of the
companyâ€™s subsidiaries or of any other body corporate in which the company is interested.
Article 20 of the Model Articles for private companies andArticle 24 for public companies
governs directorsâ€™ expenses in that the company may pay any reasonable expenses which the
directors properly incur in connection with their attendance at: (a) meetings of directors or
committees of directors, (b) general meetings, or (c) separate meetings of the holders of any
class of shares or of debentures of the company, or otherwise in connection with the exercise
of their powers and the discharge of their responsibilities in relation to the company.
Table A provides that the remuneration of the directors shall from time to time be determined by the company in general meeting. It should be noted that a provision in the articles
is not enough; there must also be an authorising resolution by the company in general meeting
âž¨ See p. 334 (In Re Duomatic Ltd, 1969, see Chapter 17 âž¨). A written resolution will suffice. The ability
to fix the fees of directors is not within Reg 70 of Table A (delegation of powers to board) (see
Foster vFoster[1916] 1 Ch 532). However, special articles could allow the directors to fix their
own remuneration by a specific provision.
Directors are not entitled to any remuneration unless the articles so provide and if they pay
themselves remuneration out of the companyâ€™s funds they may be compelled to restore it,
even though they believed that the payment was permissible (Brown and Green Ltdv Hays
(1920) 36 TLR 330). The directors cannot evade the rule by appointing themselves to salaried
posts within the company. If they do, the appointment is valid but it appears that the

Remuneration
director would not be entitled to the salary applicable to the post (Kerr vMarine Products Ltd
(1928) 44 TLR 292). Table A provides for the payment of directorsâ€™ expenses of office.
Where there is a provision for remuneration, it is payable whether profits are earned or not (Re
Lundy Granite Co(1872) 26 LT 673), and in a winding-up the directors rank for their remuneration with ordinary creditors and are not deferred, though they are not preferential creditors,
except in respect of a salary which may be payable to them as where they occupy a non-board
managerial position, e.g. a company secretary, in addition to membership of the board.
Whether a director who vacates office before completing a year in office is entitled to a
proportionate part of his yearly remuneration will depend upon the wording of the articles.
Where Table A applies (replaced by the new Model Articles in newly incorporated companies), there is no problem since under Table A directorsâ€™ remuneration accrues from day to
day so that they are entitled to a proportionate part of yearly remuneration.
If the director works for the company without a contract, he can recover a sum of money
for his service under a quantum meruit but this remedy is not available where the director has
a contract which has used inappropriate words.
Craven-Ellisv Canons Ltd[1936] 2 KB 403
The claimant was employed as managing director by the company under a deed which provided
for remuneration. The articles provided that directors must have qualification shares, and must
obtain these within two months of appointment. The claimant and other directors never obtained
the required number of shares so that the deed was invalid. However, the claimant had rendered
services, and he now sued on a quantum meruit for a reasonable sum by way of remuneration.
Held - by the Court of Appeal - he succeeded on a quantum meruit, there being no valid contract.
Re Richmond Gate Property Co Ltd[1964] 3 All ER 936
The company was incorp orated on 19 January 1962, and a resolution for a voluntary winding-up
was passed on 20 September 1962, a declaration of insolvency being filed. Walker, one of the two
joint managing directors, lodged proof of a salary claim which the liquidator rejected. Walker was
appointed on terms that he should receive â€˜such remuneration as the directors may determineâ€™,
and in fact no remuneration was fixed. He claimed Â£400 either in contract or on quantum meruit.
Held- by Plowman J - the liquidator was right in rejecting the proof. There was no claim under the
contract which was only for â€˜such remuneration as the directors may determineâ€™ and none had
been so determined. Moreover, the existence of an express contract in regard to remuneration
automatically excluded a claim on a quantum meruit.
Although the decision seems harsh and represents the law, in this case there had been an understanding that until the company got on its feet, which it never did, no remuneration should be paid.
Contract of service
Remuneration by way of contract of service is governed by different rules. Table A provides that
service contracts may be made by the board with individual directors thus ousting the general

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
fiduciary rule that a director may not contract with his company. Table A allows the director
concerned to be counted in the quorum at the meeting at which the company through
its board decides to contract with him, though he cannot vote on his own appointment.
Directors have, therefore, even under Table A, a largely unsupervised freedom to fix their own
salaries and other terms of employment by using the contract of service approach.
The Model Articles for Private Companies Limited by Shares, the Model Articles for
Private Companies Limited by Guarantee and the Model Articles for Public Companies set
forth the regulations concerning conflict of interest and directorsâ€™ contracts in Articles 14 (for
the first two) and Article 19 (for the last). All three Model Articles specifically exempt a directorâ€™s contract from being considered a conflict of interest. A director who is interested in an
actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum and voting purposes when the directorâ€™s
conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause such as arrangements pursuant to which
benefits are made available to employees and directors or former employees and directors of
the company or any of its subsidiaries which do not provide special benefits for directors or
former directors.
In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code (Financial Reporting Council, June
2010) which applies to all companies with a Premium Listing of equity shares regardless of
whether they are incorporated in the UK or elsewhere also contain provisions concerning the
level and make-up of directorsâ€™ remuneration and the procedure for determining an individual directorâ€™s remuneration. LR 9.8.8R of the Listing Rules also has information that a report
to shareholders by the board must contain on directorsâ€™ remuneration.
CA 2006, s 227 has introduced a definition of a directorâ€™s service agreement for the purposes
of Part 10 of the CA 2006 which includes contracts of service, contracts for services and letters
of appointment to the office of director. While s 227(1)(a) covers contract between the director
and the company to perform services for the company and s 227(1)(b) covers those services
the director might make available through a third party entity such as his or her personal services
company, in either case, the contract must require the director personally to perform the service or services in question. Moreover, s 227(2) ensures that the definition includes arrangements under which the director performs duties within the scope of the ordinary duties of the
director, and contracts to perform duties outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a director.
CA 2006, ss 228 to 230 replaced CA 1985, s 318 which provided that directorsâ€™ service
agreements must be open to inspection by the shareholders, unless at the relevant time the
unexpired portion of the term was less than 12 months or the company could terminate the
contract within 12 months without payment of compensation. A company must keep available for inspection copies of all directorsâ€™ service agreements (or, where the contracts are not
in writing, memoranda of their terms) entered into by the company or one of its subsidiaries
for a period of at least one year from the date of termination or from the date they expire. The
copies must be retained at the companyâ€™s registered office (or a place specified in regulations
made under CA 2006, s 1136). This includes directorsâ€™ services agreements regardless of the
length of any service agreement, e.g. whether or not it is terminable within 12 months as well
as those in respect of directors working overseas. On payment of a fee, shareholders have the
right to inspect a directorâ€™s service agreement pursuant to CA 2006, s 229 and those of shadow
directors as well under CA 2006, s 230.
CA 2006, s 188 requires shareholder approval for directorsâ€™ service agreements that are
fixed for at least two years replacing CA 1985, s 319. However, such approval is not required
by the members of a company which is either a non-UK company or a wholly owned

Remuneration
subsidiary. CA 2006, s 189 provides that if the company agrees to a provision in contravention
of s 188, the provision is void to the extent of the contravention, and the contract is deemed
to contain a term entitling the company to terminate it at any time on reasonable notice.
Taxation of directorâ€™s fees
As an â€˜office holderâ€™ for tax purposes, a non-executive directorâ€™s fees must be paid after deduction of tax and national insurance contributions at source under the HMRCâ€™s PAYE scheme.
CA 2006, s 1177 provides that it is now possible for a company to agree to pay fees gross to a
director, or to guarantee a fixed net value, although the obligation under PAYE remains.
Waiver of remuneration
If in, say, difficult times the directors wish to waive all or any of their remuneration, then in
order to protect the company from possible claims, e.g. by personal representatives following
the death of a director who had waived, the waiver should be absolute and by irrevocable deed
since the company will not normally be able to show that it gave consideration for the waiver.
A mere minute of the waiver following a resolution at a board meeting is not enough.
Reporting on directorsâ€™ pay - listed companies
CA 2006, s 412 mandates disclosure of information about directorsâ€™ benefits with special reference to remuneration. CA 2006, s 413 mandates disclosure of information about directorsâ€™
benefits such as advances, credit and guarantees. Together they replace CA 1985, s 232. CA
1985, s 232 with Schedules 6 and 7A mandated disclosure of specified information on directorsâ€™ remuneration in notes to a companyâ€™s annual report.
CA 2006, s 412 provides that the Secretary of State may make provision by regulations
requiring information to be given in notes to a companyâ€™s annual accounts about directorsâ€™
remuneration including: (a) gains made by directors on the exercise of share options; (b) benefits
received or receivable by directors under long-term incentive schemes; (c) payments for loss
of office (as defined in CA 2006, s 215); (d) benefits receivable, and contributions for the
purpose of providing benefits, in respect of past services of a person as director or in any other
capacity while director; and (e) consideration paid to or receivable by third parties for making available the services of a person as director or in any other capacity while director.
Chapter 6 of Part 15, CA 2006 deals with quoted companies directorsâ€™ regulations. Section
420 of the CA 2006 requires the directors of a quoted company to prepare a directorâ€™s remuneration report for each financial year of the company. Section 421 of the CA 2006 states that
the Secretary of State may promulgate regulation as to what may be included in the report.
CA 2006, s 421(3) requires that the directors and any person who was a director in the previous five years must provide information to the company to be included in the directorsâ€™
remuneration report. CA 2006, s 421(4) provides that failure to do so is an offence punishable by a fine. Section 422 of the CA 2006 sets forth the requirements for approval and signing of a directorsâ€™ remuneration report.
Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports)
Regulations 2008 (2008/410) replaced The Directorsâ€™ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (SI
2002/1986)(the 2002 Regulations) which were introduced to improve disclosure on quoted
companiesâ€™ pay policies for directors and to give shareholders a say on those policies at the
AGM by introducing a compulsory annual shareholdersâ€™ vote on directorsâ€™ remuneration
packages as set out in the directorsâ€™ remuneration report.

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
Directorsâ€™ remuneration reports must contain the following information:
â— The names of the persons on the companyâ€™s remuneration committee who have considered matters relating to directorsâ€™ remuneration and the name of any person who provided
material advice or services to the committee.
â— The companyâ€™s policy on directorsâ€™ remuneration for future financial years, including
details and explanations of performance criteria for share options and long-term incentive
â— A statement of how pay and employment conditions of employees of the company and of
other undertakings within the same group as the company were taken into account when
determining the directorsâ€™ remuneration for the relevant financial year.
â— A performance graph providing historic information on the companyâ€™s performance
against the relevant criteria showing the companyâ€™s total shareholder return compared
with that of a broad equity market index over a period of the five most recent financial
years (or, if fewer, the number of years since the company obtained its listing).
â— Details of the directorsâ€™ service contracts (such as date, unexpired term, notice periods,
compensation provisions, provisions on companyâ€™s liability for early termination, significant
awards made to former directors).
â— The amount of each directorâ€™s emoluments and compensation.
â— Details of the directorsâ€™ share options.
â— Details of long-term incentive schemes.
â— Details of pensions.
â— The amounts of excess retirement benefits of directors and past directors.
â— Details of significant compensation for former directors.
â— Details of sums paid to third parties in respect of a directorsâ€™ services.
Part of the directorsâ€™ remuneration report is subject to audit and this is the information
that is required by Part 3 of Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies Regulations,
e.g. the amount of each directorâ€™s emoluments and compensation in the relevant financial year;
details on share options, long-term incentive schemes and pensions. CA 2006, s 498(1)(c)
requires the companyâ€™s auditor to investigate and confirm that the auditable part of the
directorsâ€™ remuneration report is in line with the companyâ€™s accounting records and
returns and to include any information that has been omitted and which was required to be
included. CA 2006, s 422(1) requires that the board must approve the directorsâ€™ remuneration report and it must be signed on behalf of the board by a director or the company
secretary.
CA 2006, s 427 requires quoted companies to lay copies of its annual accounts and reports
before the company in general meeting. Additionally, CA 2006, s 439 provides that a quoted
company must, prior to its accounts meeting, give its members notice of an ordinary resolution approving the directorsâ€™ remuneration report, although entitlement of a person to remuneration is not conditional on the resolution being passed.
CA 2006, s 439(4) requires all persons who were directors of the company immediately
before the general meeting to ensure that the resolution is put to the vote of the meeting. As
with other fine provisions in the CA 2006, failure to comply with s 439 makes every officer in
default liable to a fine. Moreover, as with other fault schemes in the CA 2006, s 440(2) provides that if the resolution is not put to the vote of the accounts meeting, an offence has been
committed by each existing director subject to a â€˜reasonable stepsâ€™ defence provided for under
CA 2006, s 440(3).

The power to pay directors
CA 2006, s 463 provides that directors will be liable to the company in relation to the whole
of the directorsâ€™ remuneration report (or summary financial statement derived from it) but
will not have liability to anyone else relying on these reports in the absence of civil penalties
or criminal liability.
CA 2006, s 430 mandates that quoted companies now must also make their annual
accounts and reports available to the public on their website, until their accounts and reports
for the next financial year are so made available.
Paragraph 686 of the Explanatory Notes to CA 2006provides that s 440 restates the requirement under s 241A of CA 1985 that a quoted company circulate a resolution approving
the directorsâ€™ remuneration report for the preceding financial year to its shareholders prior to
its annual general meeting. However, the comment emphasises that the vote is advisory: â€˜as
such, it does not require directors to amend contractual entitlements, nor to amend their
remuneration policy, but the result of the vote will send a very strong signal to directors about
the level of support among shareholders for the boardâ€™s remuneration policy. In practice,
directors will wish to take notice of the views of the companyâ€™s members, and to respond
appropriately.â€™
The power to pay directors
As regards the power to pay, a company may remunerate its directors where this is â€˜reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the companyâ€™s businessâ€™, perBowen LJ in Hutton vWest
Cork Railway(1883) 23 Ch D 654.
Directors and the national minimum wage
It may be that while a business is being built up a director pays himself nothing while paying
other employees a reasonable wage. The director may have a spouse at work or savings, or
may simply get by on very little until the business is established. What is the position in regard
to the payment to the director of the minimum wage (NMW)?
The NMW does not apply to company directors unless they also have contracts that make
them workers. Company directors are office holders in common law and can do work and be
paid for it in that capacity. This is true no matter what sort of work is done or how it is
rewarded. However, company directors who also have employment contracts will need to be
paid the NMW for work done under that contract.
Guidance on the NMW and directors and family members working for a family company
is given in Issue 50 of the Inland Revenue Tax Bulletin. It is in the form of an article written
by the Tax Faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The guidance confirms that directors and company secretaries who are paid less than the minimum
wage should ensure that there is no contract of employment with them. That being so, the
NMW is unlikely to apply. Other family members working in a family company who are not
office holders may need to have their wages increased to comply with the NMW. There is, of
course, the possibility that the law might imply a contractwith a working office holder, such
as a director. However, the DTI (now BIS) has informed the Revenue (now HMRC) that if

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
there is no written contract of employment or other evidence of an intention to create an
employer/employee relationship, it will not contest the relationship on the implied-contract
Where the power to pay remuneration is expressly set out in the companyâ€™s constitution,
as it is in Table Aor the Model Articles, it would seem that it can be made even though the
company is not a going concern. There is no requirement that directorsâ€™ remuneration should
be paid only from distributable profits.
Re Halt Garage (1964) Ltd[1982] 3 All ER 1016
The entire issued share capital of the company was owned by a husband and wife, Mr and Mrs
Charlesworth, who were also the only directors. During its early years the company prospered.
Both husband and wife worked very hard. Later, the company got into financial problems and went
into what eventually became compulsory insolvent liquidation.
The liquidator issued a summons against husband and wife under what is now s 212 of the
Insolvency Act 1986. He wanted the court to decide that they were jointly and severally liable to
repay to him certain sums paid to them both as directors under an express power now in Reg 82
of Table Awhich provides that: â€˜The directors shall be entitled to such remuneration as the company may by ordinary resolution determine [...]â€™ during the period when the company had been
making a loss. In regard to the husbandâ€™s remuneration, the liquidator wanted repayment of that
part of it which it was alleged had exceeded the market value of the work he had done. In regard
to the wife, repayment was sought of the whole of her remuneration during the periods when
she could not work by reason of illness. Counsel for the liquidator said quite simply that the payments to Mr and Mrs C were presents which the company had no power to make and which could
not be ratified by the shareholders. Counsel for Mr and Mrs C said that the company had an
express power to determine and pay directorsâ€™ remuneration and that in the absence of fraud
on the creditors or on minority shareholders, the amount of such remuneration was a matter for
the company.
Mr Justice Oliver (as he then was) decided that:
(i) The amount of remuneration awarded to a company director was a matter of company management. Provided there ha s been a genuine exercise of the companyâ€™s power to award remuneration and in the absence of fraud on the creditors or minority shareholders, it was not for the
court to determine it or to decide to what extent it was reasonable.
(ii) Since there was no evidence, having regard to the companyâ€™s turnover, that Mr Câ€™s drawings
were obviously excessive or unreasonable or that they were disguised gifts of capital, the court
would not enquire whether it would have been more for the benefit of the company if he had taken
less. That was a matter for the company. The claim for misfeasance in regard to Mr Câ€™s drawings
(iii) As regards Mrs Câ€™s drawings, the companyâ€™s articles (now Reg 82 of Table A) gave power to
award remuneration to a director on the mere assumption of office. It was not necessary that he
should be active in any sense. To this extent the liquidatorâ€™s claim that he should recover everything paid to Mrs C during periods of absence failed. However, where a director was not active,
the court could examine the amount of the drawings. In the circumstances Mrs C was entitled to
Â£10 per week (she had drawn Â£30) merely for being a director even during the period in which she
was not active. Amounts drawn in excess of this were repayable to the liquidator.
It would appear from this decision, which affirms Re Lundy Granite Co Ltd, Lewisâ€™s Case(1872)
26 LT 673, that there is no need for directorsâ€™ remuneration to come from profits. Any requirement

that it must would bring some companies to a standstill and prevent those which had fallen on hard
times from being brought round. The creditorsâ€™ right to have the capital kept intact is subject to the
consideration that directors may be paid remuneration.
Compensation for loss of office
CA 2006, ss 215-222 set out the provisions on payments for loss of office. These scenarios
might include the retirement of a director from a company or other situation when an individual loses his position as director. It is important to note that the sections cover both loss
of employment in connection with the management of company affairs as well as the loss of
office as director including both payments made in connection with retirement and non-cash
benefits which count towards compensation under CA 2006, s 215(2). Shareholder approval
(CA 2006, ss 217(1) and 218(1)) is required where a company wishes to make a payment for
loss of office to a director of the company or a payment for loss of office to a director of the
company in connection with the transfer of the whole or any part of the undertaking or property of the company. CA 2006, s 219 mandates shareholder approval for payments for loss of
office to a director in connection with a share transfer in relation to shares in the company or
a subsidiary, resulting from a takeover bid. CA 2006, s 220 exempts payments made in good
faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation, e.g. damages for breach of such an obligation
by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination
of a personâ€™s office or employment from approval by shareholders. If the company or any of
its subsidiaries is making only a small payment to the director which does not exceed Â£200
then this payment needs no shareholder approval pursuant to CA 2006, s 221. All payments
made to directors for loss of office or for anything to which a director is entitled under the
service agreement are not included in the substantial property transaction regime to be discussed below whereby shareholdersâ€™ approval is required.
If a payment is not disclosed and approved by shareholders where required, the director
holds the money on trust for the company, and must repay the sum involved to the company
âž¨ See p. 334 (In Re Duomatic Ltd, 1969, see Chapter 17 âž¨). Furthermore, a director is also by reason of
CA 2006, s 219 under a duty to disclose payment for loss of office made in connection with a
transfer of shares on an offer, for example, to take over the company. In so far as the amount
a director is to receive is not disclosed and approved by the shareholders, the director concerned holds the money on trust for persons who have sold their shares as a result of the offer.
The director concerned must bear the expense of distributing the compensation to them.
A payment will be treated as compensation for loss of office only if the company is under
no legal obligation to make it. Thus payment of damages to a director who is dismissed in
breach of his service contract, whether the damages are settled out of court or assessed by the
court, does not require the approval of members. It was held in MercervHeart of Midlothian
plc2001 SLT 945 that payments by way of compensation are not confined to cash payments
but can cover also the transfer of a company asset.
In addition, an amount which a director receives under the terms of his service contract on
his resignation or removal from office in terms of severance pay is not treated as compensation for loss of office because the company is obliged by the contract to pay it. Thus, it is
payable unconditionally when the resignation or removal takes place and it does not require

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
the approval of the members in general meeting (Taupo Totara Timber Co LtdvRowe[1977]
3 All ER 123). The decision of the Privy Council in Taupo was affirmed by the Court of
Session in Lander vPremier Pict Petroleum Ltd [1998] BCC 248.
Fair dealing by directors
This section is concerned with the basic rules relating to loans, quasi-loans and credit to directors, along with material interests and substantial property transactions. CA 2006, ss 197-214
(replacing CA 1985, ss 330-342) introduced major changes some of which we will explore herein.
Most critically, the CA 2006 abolished the general prohibition on loans to directors and
replaced it with a requirement of shareholder approval for all companies. CA 2006 also introduced provisions to ensure that public companies, and any private company associated with
a public company, may only make quasi-loans to directors, loans or quasi-loans to connected
persons or enter into credit transactions with directors or connected persons, if shareholder
approval is obtained. CA 2006 also abolished the criminal penalty for breach of the provisions
on loans, raised the maximum amounts for the exceptions for expenditure on company business, small loans, small quasi-loans and small credit transactions, abolished the maximum
amounts for the money lending companies exception and allowed for affirmation of loans,
quasi-loans and credit transactions entered into by the company in line with the substantial
property transaction provisions. Most critical to note is that the CA 2006 made significant
changes to the regime that applies to loans made by a company to its directors by replacing
the general prohibition on loans to directors with a requirement for member approval.
Loans, etc. to directors
CA 2006 made significant reforms to the regulatory structure that applies to loans made by
a company to its directors. It replaced the general prohibition on loans to directors with a
requirement for member approval. Restrictions still exist for public companies (and private
companies associated with public companies) with respect to quasi-loans and credit transactions. A description of loans, quasi-loans, credit and connected persons may be useful at
this point.
Loans and quasi-loans
Basically a quasi-loan occurs when a director incurs personal expenditure but the company
pays the bill. The director pays the company back later. In a loan situation the company
would put the director in funds: he would buy, say, personal goods with the money, and then
repay the loan. In some cases, for example, quasi-loans arise when the company buys a yearly
railway season ticket for a director of the company or its holding company and he then repays
the company; or a director uses a company credit card to pay for personal goods, e.g. a video,
and the company pays the credit card company and then the director reimburses the company. CA 2006, s 199 defines â€˜quasi-loanâ€™ adapting the CA 1985, s 331(3) definition.
Examples are: (1) a furniture company sells furniture to a director of the company (or its
holding company) on terms that payment be deferred for 12 months; (2) the company

Fair dealing by directors
services a directorâ€™s personal car in its workshops and the director is given time to pay;
(3) Motor Sales plc sells a BMW to the wife of one of its directors under a hire-purchase
agreement. The wife is a â€˜connected personâ€™ and in some cases transactions with such persons
are controlled.
Connected persons
In broad terms, a person who is not a director of the company concerned is regarded as
connected with a director of the company if the person is the spouse, child or stepchild (under
18 years of age) of that director. Also connected are companies (called associated companies)
in which the director and his connected persons have together a one-fifth or more interest in
the equity share capital or control one-fifth or more of the voting power.
Trustees of trusts whose beneficiaries include the director or the directorâ€™s spouse or any
child or stepchild (under 18) or any associated company are also connected, as is a partner of
the director or a partner of the directorâ€™s connected persons.
CA 2006, s 197 enables all companies to make loans to directors of the company or holding company, or give guarantees or provide security for loans made by any person to such
directors, with shareholder consent. Where the director is a director of the companyâ€™s holding company, the members of the holding company must also approve the transaction. No
approval is required by members of a company which is not a UK-registered company or is a
wholly owned subsidiary.
Relevant statutory provisions
CA 2006, s 198 prohibits a public company or a company associated with a public company,
from making a quasi-loan to a director of the company or its holding company, or from
giving a guarantee or providing security in connection with a quasi-loan to such a director,
unless shareholder consent has been given (including consent of the members of the holding
company where the director concerned is a director of the holding company). No approval is
required by members of a company which is not a UK-registered company or is a wholly
owned subsidiary. Under CA 2006, s 256, companies are associated if one is a subsidiary of
the other or both are subsidiaries of the same body corporate.
CA 2006, s 200 considers loans or quasi-loans to persons connected with directors. A public company or company associated with a public company may not make a loan or quasiloan to a person connected with a director of the company or its holding company or give a
guarantee or provide security in connection with a loan or quasi-loan made to such a connected person, unless shareholder approval is obtained (including consent of the members of
the holding company where the connected person is connected with a director of the holding
company). No approval is required by members of a company which is not a UK-registered
company or is a wholly owned subsidiary.
CA 2006, s 201 covers credit transactions in that it states that a public company or a company associated with a public company may not enter into credit transactions or give a guarantee or provide security in connection with a credit transaction entered into for the benefit
of a director of the company or its holding company or a person connected with such a director, unless shareholder consent is obtained (including consent of the members of the holding
company where the director or connected person is a director of the holding company or a
person connected with such a director). No approval is required by members of a company
which is not a UK-registered company or is a wholly owned subsidiary. A â€˜credit transactionâ€™
is defined in CA 2006, s 202.

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
CA 2006, s 203 requires shareholder approval in relation to related arrangements. A related
arrangement is one in which another person enters into a transaction that would have
required shareholder approval under CA 2006, ss 197, 198, 200 or 201 if the company had
entered into the transaction and under that arrangement, that person obtains a benefit from
the company or a company associated with it. Alternatively, it can be where the company
arranges for the assignment to it, or assumption of rights, obligations or liabilities under a
transaction that, if it had been entered by the company, would have required shareholder
CA 2006, ss 197, 198, 200 and 201 mandate additional requirements that must be met with
respect to related transactions in addition to obtaining shareholder consent. For instance, a
written memorandum setting out the nature of the transaction or arrangement, the amount
and purpose of the loan, guarantee or credit transaction and the extent of the companyâ€™s liability connected with it must be made available to shareholders before they give their approval
by way of ordinary or written resolution.
However, shareholder consent need not be obtained under CA 2006, ss 197, 198, 200 or
201 if the transaction falls into one of the following exceptions:
â— CA 2006, s 204 applies where (i) expenditures are made on company business and (ii) the
value of the transaction in question and the value of relevant transactions or arrangements,
do not exceed a maximum of Â£50,000. Expenditures here include funds provided to directors of the companyâ€™s holding company and connected persons.
â— CA 2006, s 205 applies where expenditures covered by this exception are restricted to
expenditure in defending criminal or civil proceedings in connection with any alleged
negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by the director in relation to the company or an associated company.
â— CA 2006, s 206 applies where expenditures in connection with regulatory action or investigation are made. Where anything is done by a company to provide a director (or director of its holding company) with funds to meet (or avoid) expenditure incurred or to be
incurred by him in defending himself in an investigation by a regulatory authority, or
against action proposed to be taken by a regulatory authority, in connection with any
alleged negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by him in relation to the company or an associated company, this exception is triggered.
â— CA 2006, s 207(1) provides an exception for minor business expenses and transactions,
loans of small amounts remains and quasi-loans (not just short-term quasi-loans) in and
up to Â£10,000.
â— CA 2006, s 207(2) provides an exception for minor credit transactions up to Â£15,000.
â— CA 2006, s 207(3) provides an exception where the credit transaction is in the ordinary
course of the companyâ€™s business and is not on more favourable terms than would be
offered to an unconnected person of the same financial standing.
â— CA 2006, s 208 covers intra-group transactions made by associated body corporates which
is where one body corporate is a subsidiary of the other or both are subsidiaries of the same
body corporate.
â— CA 2006, s 211(7) provides that where the value of a transaction or arrangement is
unascertainable, it is deemed to exceed Â£50,000.
â— CA 2006, s 214 provides that where the transaction or arrangement is affirmed by the
shareholders within a reasonable period, the transaction may no longer be avoided.

Fair dealing by directors
Consequences of contravention
There are consequences in civil law as follows.
A loan which contravenes the provisions set out above is voidable at the instance of the
company but no one else (CA 2006, s 213). In consequence, the company will be able to
recover the funds from those into whose hands they have passed and there would appear to
be no limit in time for avoiding the transaction. However, there are exceptions where:
â— it is no longer possible to make restitution, as where the loan has been spent on a cruise;
â— the company has been indemnified, e.g. by the borrowing director;
â— avoidance of the loan would affect rights which were acquired in good faith and for value
and without actual notice by a person other than the person for whom the loan was made.
This is the usual protection for third parties and would, for example, cover the shipping
company which had provided the cruise referred to above so that the loan would not be
recovered from such a company.
It appears from case law that the existence of the above-mentioned tracing of funds remedies depends upon whether or not the company has actually avoided the contract of loan.
Ciro Citterio Menswear plcv Thakrar[2002] 2 All ER 717
In this case the High Court ruled that an illegal loan to a director which had been used to purchase
a house could not be recovered by the companyâ€™s administrator by an order for a sale of the property to extract the amount of the loan from the proceeds. At the time the property was purchased
the company had not rescinded the loan so that the director was still the owner of the loan.
Therefore no tracing remedy was available.
The administrator presumably did not rate highly his chances of getting repayment from the director
and went instead for a tracing remedy into the property purchased with the loan. It would seem
that the tracing remedy could be used if the loan was used to buy the property after the company
had provided evidence, e.g. a board resolution that it had rescinded the loan.
In addition, whether or not the transaction has been rescinded, the director who is a party
to it is liable to account to the company for any gain made from the loan and to indemnify
the company against any loss or damage it has suffered which has not been put right by
rescinding the loan. This liability is extended also to any other director who authorised the
transaction, though such a person will not be liable if he can show that he did not know the
relevant circumstances constituting the contravention at the time the transaction was made.
As an example of the above-mentioned civil remedies, the Court of Appeal has decided
that a company is entitled under CA 1985 to demand from a director immediate repayment
of an illegal loan made to the director, regardless of any other terms of the contract of loan
which may provide differently.
Tait Consibee (Oxford) Ltdv Tait[1997] 2 BCLC 349
On 1 February 1994 the claimant company made a loan of Â£10,000 to the defendant, who was
at that time a director of the company. In July 1994 the defendantâ€™s employment terminated and in
October 1994 he ceased to be a director. By a letter dated 9 January 1995 the company demanded

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
repayment of the loan. The defendant admitted that he received that letter of demand. Since the
loan was not repaid, the company commenced an action for its recovery. The defendant said that
it was agreed that the loan was to be repaid from dividends declared by the company, and since
no dividends had been declared the loan was not repayable, at least at the relevant point in time.
The terms of the loan agreement, which was not recorded in writing, were disputed by the company. However, the company also contended in support of its claim that the loan was recoverable
anyway, regardless of the terms of any agreement (in this case, repayment from dividends), since
the loan was illegal under s 330 and therefore recoverable under s 341. The Court of Appeal
accepted the companyâ€™s contention. The only section that might have applied to make the loan
valid was s 334 which exempts loans of small amounts but applies only to loans which do not
exceed Â£5,000. The loan in this case, being Â£10,000, was prohibited and recoverable. The decision of the lower court which gave the company judgment for that sum plus interest was affirmed
by the Court of Appeal.
Shadow directors
By reason of CA 2006, s 223, shadow directors are included in both the civil and criminal
sanctions.
Material interests
Material interests of directors and their connected persons must also be disclosed in a note to
the accounts. A material interest could be, for example, a contract to build a new office block
which the company had entered into with a building firm run by a director, or by the spouse
of a director. It might also be a loan to the brother of a director. A brother is not a connected
person but the loan might be a material interest.
The treatment of directorsâ€™ loan accounts
The materials set out above may have to be applied in regard to a not uncommon feature of
private companies: the directorsâ€™ loan accounts. Two situations may arise as follows.
(a) The loan account is overdrawn
In this case the directors owe money to the company and problems may arise either during
the companyâ€™s lifetime, as on a directorâ€™s resignation, and even more likely on its insolvent
liquidation. The directors may have made drawings against the companyâ€™s funds that have
been allocated to a loan account. Consideration needs to be given to the following matters:
â— Are the drawings to be regarded as loans to directors? If so, then there are issues to be
addressed in terms of compliance with company law requirements. If the drawings are
unlawful loans the company or a liquidator can set them aside and require repayment to
the company by the director.
â— Are the drawings dividends received by the director in regard to a shareholding? If so, the
distribution rules in company law must be addressed. Drawings may sometimes be
justified on the basis that they are made in expectation of dividends though this is a risky
strategy if the dividends do not materialise and it is a pointless strategy if the company was
not in a position to pay dividends.
â— Are the drawings remuneration? If they are, as where the director has carried out work or
given services to the company, then the drawings are perfectly permissible given that the
work or services have been rendered, though issues of taxation must be addressed.

Fair dealing by directors
â— Are the drawings a misappropriation of corporate assets? If so, the company and its
liquidator can seek recovery of the sums paid.
(b) The loan account is in credit
In this case the directors have lent money to the company which has not repaid it fully or at
all. The problems that arise here are in connection with impending insolvency where the
directors have arranged for the repayment of the loans and have been required to repay the
sums to the company upon commencement of its liquidation as preferences. Since the directors are connected persons for the purposes of the repayment any repayment that is made
within two years immediately prior to the commencement of winding-up may well amount
to a preference that can be challenged by the liquidator.
The case law
There is instructive case law on the above matters as follows.
First Global Media Group Ltdv Larkin[2003] All ER (D) 293 (Nov)
In this case a director tried to establish his drawings as remuneration but this was not acceptable
to the court because there was a directorsâ€™ agreement that in order to minimise tax no remuneration would be paid to directors. A further attempt to establish the drawings as dividends failed
since, at the time the sums were drawn, the company was incurring losses and there were no distributable profits. The drawings were repayable to the liquidator.
Currencies Direct Ltdv Ellis[2003] 2 BCLC 482
Here a director was successful in establishing drawings as remuneration. He had done work and
rendered services to the company and the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the drawings were
the consideration. The court also stated that remuneration could take different forms and need not
be in the nature of a regular wage or salary cheque or credit. Remuneration might consist in payment of the consideration to a third party in discharge of the debts of the person who had done or
was to do the work or render services. It could take the form of commissions, fees or bonuses. It
could be a lump sum payment or be spread over a period and the payment need not be backed
by a formal contract. It might arise from the companyâ€™s obligation to pay reasonable remuneration
under an implied contract. The company could not recover the sums paid. They were not loans.
Re Conegrade Ltd[2003] BPIR 358
In this case the directorsâ€™ loan account was in credit to the extent of some Â£65,000. At a time when
the company was insolvent the directors purchased an asset from the company at the market
value of Â£125,000. The consideration was a payment by the directors of Â£60,000 to the company
and the cancellation of the credit balance on the loan account. The company went into insolvent
liquidation and the liquidators challenged the transaction as a preference. The High Court ruled
that it was. The directors were put in a better position in terms of their loans to the company of
Â£65,000 than they would have been if they had been reduced to proving for that sum as unsecured
creditors in the liquidation. The directors were ordered to pay the sum of Â£65,000 to the company.
They would then have to prove as unsecured creditors in the liquidation for that sum.

Chapter 18 Financial arrangements with, and fair dealing by, directors
Advice to directors
The following are some major points for consideration:
â— Directors who have lent money to the company through a loan account should be
appraised of the legal rules regarding preference. They should not repay any amounts due
to them in the two years immediately prior to an insolvency.
â— With regard to drawings made by directors it is important to ensure:
(a) that the date and amount of the drawings are properly documented; and
(b) that the basis on which they have been made is clearly stated.
Directorsâ€™ contracts with the company
Under CA 2006, s 182 which replaces CA 1985, s 317, a director must declare the nature and
any direct or indirect interest that he has in any transaction or arrangement entered into by
the company. In Guinness vSaunders[1990] 1 All ER 652 the House of Lords ruled that disclosure had to be made at a full meeting of the board and not at a meeting of a committee of
the board.
If the director is a member of another concern which is doing business with the company,
he may give a general notice of interest, either orally to the board, or in writing to the company, and this will cover a series of contracts made with the other concern. If a director fails
to make proper disclosure of his interest, he is liable to a fine.
The provisions are extended to cover any transaction or arrangement of the type set out
under the loans, quasi-loans and credit heading and it should be noted that the interest of a
connected person, unless the connected person is also a director, is treated for these purposes
as an interest of the director. The above rules are extended to shadow directors.
Although the major sanction is a default fine, the company can in any case rescind the
contract made with the director because of the fiduciary duty that exists, but it must be possible to restore the status quo (per Lord Denning MR in Hely-Hutchinson v Brayhead[1968]
1 QB 549). The articles may provide otherwise or the members in general meeting may, by
ordinary resolution, waive the companyâ€™s rights to rescind, but there can be no waiver by
the board.
In this regard, Craven Textile Engineers Ltd v Batley Football Club Ltd, Transcript: B2
99/1127, CA is of interest. A director of the claimant company was also a former director of
the football club. The claimant did work for and supplied goods to the football club during
the period of the dual directorship. The football club purported to avoid the contract because
it appeared that the director concerned had not declared his interest in the contracts to the
companies. The Court of Appeal noted that s 317 does not deal with the civil consequences of
a breach but at common law the contracts could be avoided by the company. However, it
must be possible to restore the parties to their pre-contractual positions before this could be
done. In this case that was not possible as the goods and services had already been supplied.
The claimant was therefore entitled to payment of the invoices.
In Re Neptune (Vehicle Washing Equipment) Ltd (1995) The Times, 2 March, the High
Court had to decide whether a sole director must hold a board meeting and formally declare
his interest in a contract with the company and record it in the minutes. The High Court said
he must and if not the company could rescind the contract. So, in effect, s 317 applies in this
situation even though the director is disclosing what he already knows to himself.

Fair dealing by directors
It should also be noted that under Table Aa director who has disclosed an interest cannot
count towards the quorum of the board on the item in which he is interested nor vote upon
it. These provisions of Table A should be amended or excluded where a private company
intends to operate through a sole director since otherwise he cannot approve any transaction
in which he is interested.
In addition, in the absence of disclosure, a director who has received a payment under an
undisclosed contract with his company is regarded as holding that payment in the capacity of
a constructive trustee for the company and is bound to repay the sum received although he
may have a claim for compensation for any services actually rendered under the undisclosed
contract (Guinness vSaunders[1990] 1 All ER 652).
Substantial property transactions
Under CA 2006, ss 190-196, in both public and private companies, the approval of the
members by ordinary (or written) resolution of any contract to transfer to, or receive from, a
director (or connected person) a non-cash asset, e.g. land, exceeding Â£100,000 or exceeding
10 per cent of the companyâ€™s net assets, whichever is the lowest, is required. The provision
does not apply, however, to non-cash assets of less than Â£5,000 in value.
Thus a company whose assets less its liabilities amounted to Â£200,000 would have to comply with this provision in respect of a transaction with a director or connected person for a
non-cash asset worth more than Â£20,000.
The provisions are designed to prevent directors (at least without member approval) from
buying assets from the company at less than their true value or transferring their own property to the company at more than market value. At least if they are to do this the members
must be aware of it and approve by ordinary (or written) resolution. If the above provisions
are infringed the contract is voidable by the company but not by the director.
The asset would not require valuation by an independent accountant (see Chapter 12)
unless it was the acquisition of a non-cash asset by the company from a director; the company
was a plc; and the consideration to the director was shares in the company.
Board minutes
Disclosure of material transactions is the responsibility of the director concerned. Such matters must be disclosed to the board of directors and recorded in board minutes. Inspection of
directorsâ€™ minute books should identify such transactions and any discussion that took place
regarding materiality. CA 2006, s 177 requires directors to declare their interests in transactions or arrangements which are proposed but have not yet been entered into by the company. CA 2006, s 182 covers declaration of interests in relation to existing transactions or
arrangements that the company has already entered into. The declaration must be of both
the nature and extent of the directorâ€™s direct or indirect interest. In other words, a further
declaration must be made if an earlier declaration proves to be or becomes inaccurate or
incomplete.
There is no need to make a declaration of interest if the interest cannot reasonably be
regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest. Similarly, there is also no need to disclose anything the other directors already know about or ought reasonably to have known.
A declaration of an interest in an existing transaction or arrangement must be made as soon as
reasonably practicable. In the last resort, if materiality cannot be agreed between the auditor
and the directors, legal advice must be sought.

The duties of directors

Scope and nature of general duties
The CA 2006 codifies the general duties of directors
In this chapter, we shall consider the duties which directors owe to the company, to employees, to individual shareholders and to outsiders. The CA 2006 has taken a major step forward
to codify the general duties of directors. For instance, directorsâ€™ fiduciary and common law
duties have now been partly codified and governed by the CA 2006. In twelve sections applying to directors, Chapter 2 of Part 10 of the CA 2006 sets out their general duties. These general duties now are a code of conduct for how directors must behave. They are not however
all the duties that directors owe his or her company as a number are found elsewhere in the
CA 2006 and in other statutes. Other duties are still not codified although commonly accepted.
Section 170 of the CA 2006 explains that the statutory duties are based on and have effect
in place of certain common law rules and principles of equity. It also explains that the general
duties should be interpreted and applied in the same way as common law rules and equitable
principle. Moreover, when interpreting and applying the statutory duties, the common law
rules and equitable principles that the general duties replaced should be consulted. Finally,
s 170 also identifies that the civil consequences of breach of the statutory duties are the same
as those that would apply if the corresponding common law rule or equitable principles were
Scope and nature of general duties
Section 170 of the Companies Act 2006 provides the context for the newly codified duties of
directors.
1 The general duties specified in ss 171 to 177 are owed by a director of a company to the
2 A person who ceases to be a director continues to be subject:
(a) to the duty in s 175 (duty to avoid conflicts of interest) as regards the exploitation of
any property, information or opportunity of which he became aware at a time when
he was a director, and
(b) to the duty in s 176 (duty not to accept benefits from third parties) as regards things
done or omitted by him before he ceased to be a director.
To that extent those duties apply to a former director as to a director, subject to any necessary adaptations.
3 The general duties are based on certain common law rules and equitable principles as they
apply in relation to directors and have effect in place of those rules and principles as
regards the duties owed to a company by a director.
4 The general duties shall be interpreted and applied in the same way as common law rules
or equitable principles, and regard shall be had to the corresponding common law rules
and equitable principles in interpreting and applying the general duties.
5 The general duties apply to shadow directors where, and to the extent that, the corresponding common law rules or equitable principles so apply.
It is clear from s 170(1) that these general duties are owed by a director to the company.
Thus, only the company or members acting on behalf of the company (derivative claims such

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
as those contained in Part 11 of the CA 2006) can enforce them. The duties apply to directors
of the company, de factodirectors and, in some cases, to former directors.
It is important to note a number of key issues at this stage. First of all, s 170(3) emphasizes
the fact that these general duties are based on common law rules and equitable principles and,
as such, should be interpreted and applied in the same way as the previous rules. This is not
only significant in terms of using the case law so as to support the implementation of these
codified duties of directors but also suggests a rather smoother transition from one era to
another (i.e. common law to statute) in this area. Secondly, when considering the consequences of any breach of these statutory duties, or the way in which they are to be enforced,
s 187 provides:
1 The consequences of breach (or threatened breach) of ss 171-177 are the same as would
apply if the corresponding common law rule or equitable principle applied.
2 The duties in those sections (with the exception of s 174 (duty to exercise reasonable care,
skill and diligence)) are, accordingly, enforceable in the same way as any other fiduciary
duty owed to a company by its directors.
Consequently, in order to appreciate fully the general duties embodied in the Companies
Act 2006, as well as to gain an insight into how the courts are likely to interpret and subsequently apply these statutory legal obligations, it is necessary to review the fiduciary duties
which, until recently, bound directors. In this regard, a review of the common law duties
which have led to the development of Chapter 2 of Part 10 of the Companies Act 2006 will be
undertaken alongside the statutory duties of directors.
Duty to act within powers
The statutory duty
Section 171 of the Companies Act 2006 states:
A director of a company must:
(a) act in accordance with the companyâ€™s constitution, and
(b)only exercise powers for the purposes for which they are conferred.
The related common law and equitable principles
One of the main considerations to be borne in mind is that directors use their powers for the
proper purpose (i.e. for the benefit of the company and not to further their own interests).
âž¨ See pp. 129 Consideration has already been given to this rule which is illustrated by the decisions in the
and 289 Rolled Steel case (see Chapter 6 âž¨), Clemens vClemens(see Chapter 15 âž¨) and Galloway v
âž¨ See p. 334 HallÃ© Concerts Society(see Chapter 17 âž¨) among others.
A further example of improper use of power by directors is to be found in situations where
directors have issued new shares to persons who were their nominees, e.g. the companyâ€™s
pension trustees, not because the company needed more capital (the proper purpose of a
companyâ€™s directors issuing shares) but to defeat a genuine takeover bid by another company.
The nominees they knew would not accept the bid so that the bidder would not get an

Duty to act within powers
adequate majority of shares and so not proceed with the bid, thus keeping the directors in
power (see Hogg vCramphorn[1966] 3 All ER 420). There is, of course, statutory protection
in this area in that the directors require the authority of the members to allot shares, and there
are also pre-emption rights given to existing shareholders unless the shareholders have disapplied them. Nevertheless, cases such as Hogghave a continuing relevance since in private
companies these rights may be disapplied by the articles. In such a situation, the case law
would have to be used to render the allotment of shares to the nominees invalid. A further
â€˜poison pillâ€™ device was before the High Court in the following case.
Criterion Properties plcv Stratford UK Properties LLC[2002] 2 BCLC 151
The managing director of the claimant company made an agreement with a substantial shareholder that required the company to buy out the shareholder at a high price should there be a
change of control or composition of the board of directors of the company. The managing director was later removed from office and the company asked the court to set aside the agreement
because it was entered into for an improper purpose. The High Court ruled that the agreement,
which was intended to put off an unwelcome bidder, in a predatory takeover, had been made for
an improper purpose. The damage that would be caused to the company by making the substantial shareholder buy-out would be greater than any harm likely to be inflicted on it by an
acquisition. The agreement was not a proper exercise of a directorâ€™s powers and could not be
enforced against the company.
A â€˜poison pillâ€™ is North American jargon for a legal device of any form put in place by the management of a company that feels vunerable to predatory acquisition, designed as a defence mechanism
to eliminate or reduce that risk. Other expressions such as â€˜shark repellantâ€™ are also used.
Therefore, a director has a duty to exercise the companyâ€™s powers for the purposes for
âž¨ See p. 94 which they were allocated to him and the Board of Directors (see discussion in Chapter 4 âž¨).
This is reinforced by T urner LJâ€™s statement in Re Cameronâ€™s Coalbrook Steam Coal, and
Swansea and Kougher Railway Co, Bennettâ€™s Case (1854) 5 De GM & G 284,
...in the exercise of the powers given to them...they must, as I conceive, keep within the
proper limits. Powers given to them for one purpose cannot, in my opinion, be used by them
for another and different purpose. To permit such proceedings on the part of directors of companies would be to sanction not the use but the abuse of their powers. It would be to give effect
and validity to an illegal exercise of a legal power.
The question naturally arises as to where the limits of a directorâ€™s powers end and when an
individual starts to overstep what is deemed to be an acceptable use of their powers. In many
instances, a common sense approach will suffice as a companyâ€™s articles should outline the
various powers/day-to-day decision-making activities which have been given to the board
of directors. However, this will not always be the case and, in those instances, it will be
necessary to look at the specific facts of the case and for the court to decide if a power has
been exercised for a proper or improper purpose and as to whether the director has acted in
accordance with the companyâ€™s constitution (Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd
[1974] AC 821).

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
Howard Smith Ltdv Ampol Petroleum Ltd[1974] AC 821
Two companies, A and B, held 55 per cent of the issued shares of company M, which required
more capital. A made an offer for all the issued shares of M, and another company, H, announced
an intention to make a higher offer for those shares. Mâ€™s directors considered Aâ€™s offer too low and
decided to recommend that the offer be rejected. A and B then stated that they intended to act
jointly in the future operations of M and would reject any offer for their shares. H then applied to
M for an allotment of 41/2million ordinary shares; Mâ€™s directors decided by a majority to make the
allotment and immediately issued the shares. The effect of that issue was that M had much needed
capital; A and Bâ€™s shareholding was reduced to 36.6 per cent of the issued shares and H was in
a position to make an effective takeover offer. A challenged the validity of the issue of the shares
to H and sought an order in the Supreme Court for the rectification of the share register by the
removal of H as a member of M in respect of the allotted shares. Mâ€™s directors contended that
the primary reason for the issue of the shares to H was to obtain more capital. On Appeal Lord
Wilberforce stated:
To define in advance exact limits beyond which directors must not pass is, in their Lordshipsâ€™ view,
impossible. This clearly cannot be done by enumeration, since the variety of situations facing directors of different types of company in different situations cannot be anticipated. No more, in their
Lordshipsâ€™ view, can this be done by the use of a phrase - such as â€˜bona fide in the interest of the
company as a wholeâ€™, or â€˜for some corporate purposeâ€™. Such phrases, if they do anything more than
restate the general principle applicable to fiduciary powers, at best serve, negatively, to exclude from
the area of validity cases where the directors are acting sectionally, or partially: i.e. improperly favouring one section of the shareholders against another...
In their Lordshipsâ€™ opinion it is necessary to start with a consideration of the power whose exercise is in question, in this case a power to issue shares. Having ascertained, on a fair view, the nature
of this power, and having defined as can best be done in the light of modern conditions the, or some,
limits within which it may be exercised, it is then necessary for the court, if a particular exercise of it
is challenged, to examine the substantial purpose for which it was exercised, and to reach a conclusion whether that purpose was proper or not in doing so it will necessarily give credit to the bona
fide opinion of the directors, if such is found to exist, and will respect their judgment as to matters of
management; having done this, the ultimate conclusion has to be as to the side of a fairly broad
line on which the case falls.
Held - dismissing the appeal, that, although the directors had acted honestly and had power
to make the allotment, to alter a majority shareholding was to interfere with that element of the
companyâ€™s constitution which was separate from and set against the directorsâ€™ powers and,
accordingly, it was unconstitutional for the directors to use their fiduciary powers over the shares
in the company for the purpose of destroying an existing majority or creating a new majority; and
that, since the directorsâ€™ primary object for the allotment of shares was to alter the majority
shareholding, the directors had improperly exercised their powers and the allotment was invalid.
In addition, the state of mind of the directors at the time that an alleged abuse or misuse
of powers took place is an important consideration for the courts. In the case of Hogg v
Cramphorn [1966] 3 All ER 420, it was acknowledged by the courts that while Colonel
Cramphorn had exceeded the true purpose for which the power to allot shares had been conveyed to the companyâ€™s directors, his intentions were, nevertheless, bona fide in what he considered to be the best interest of the company. However, there may be instances where the
rationale behind a directorâ€™s improper use of a power may be multi-faceted and, in such instances, the courts will seek to identify the â€˜dominant purpose behind the actâ€™. This issue was
considered by Viscount Finlay in Hindlev John Cotton Ltd (1919) 56 SLR 625, when he noted:

Duty to promote the success of the company
Where the question is one of abuse of powers, the state of mind of those who acted, and the
motives on which they acted, are all important, and you may go into the question of what their
intention was, collecting from the surrounding circumstances all the materials which genuinely
throw light upon that question of the state of mind of the directors so as to show whether they
were honestly acting in discharge of their powers in the interests of the company or were acting
from some by-motive, possibly of personal advantage, or for any other reason.
This is reinforced by Lord Wilberforceâ€™s observation in Howard Smith Ltdv Ampol Petroleum
Ltd [1974] AC 821 (see above):
When a dispute arises whether directors of a company made a particular decision for one purpose or for another, or whether, there being more than one purpose, one or another purpose
was the substantial or primary purpose, the court, in their Lordshipâ€™s opinion, is entitled to look
at the situation objectively in order to estimate how critical or pressing, or substantial or, per
contra, insubstantial an alleged requirement may have been. If it finds that a particular requirement, though real, was not urgent, or critical, at the relevant time, it may have reason to doubt,
or discount, the assertions of individuals that they acted solely in order to deal with it, particularly when the action they took was unusual or even extreme.
Duty to promote the success of the company
The statutory duty
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that:
1 A director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most
likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and
in doing so have regard (among other matters) to:
(a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term,
(b) the interests of the companyâ€™s employees,
(c) the need to foster the companyâ€™s business relationships with suppliers, customers and
(d) the impact of the companyâ€™s operations on the community and the environment,
(e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
(f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company.
2 Where or to the extent that the purposes of the company consist of or include purposes
other than the benefit of its members, subsection (1) has effect as if the reference to promoting the success of the company for the benefit of its members were to achieving those
3 The duty imposed by this section has effect subject to any enactment or rule of law requiring directors, in certain circumstances, to consider or act in the interests of creditors of the
The decision as to what will promote success and what is success is one for the directorâ€™s
good faith judgment and will be discussed further below in relation to the case law in the area.
However, a look at the directorâ€™s motive and intent will be essential for divining such judgment on a directorâ€™s part. It is also worth noting that the â€˜six factorsâ€™ set forth in s 172 must

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
find their way into every decision a director makes on behalf of a company and they are only
subservient to the duty of directors to promote the success of the company.
The related common law and equitable principles
In many respects, the case law already discussed in relation to a directorâ€™s duty to act in accordance with the companyâ€™s constitution and to use the powers available to him for their proper
purposes overlaps with this statutory duty. However, it is worth considering some of the case
law which relates to the decision-making process and, more importantly, whether the actions
of a director will be second-guessed by a court which has the benefit of hindsight.
In Re Smith and Fawcett Ltd [1942] Ch 304, Lord Greene MR observed that directors must
act â€˜bona fide in what they consider - not what a court may consider - is in the interests of
the company, and not for any collateral purposeâ€™. Consequently, if this approach is applied to
s 172 then a director is expected to behave in a fashion that he himself honestly considers will
be most likely to promote the success of the company. The court will not intervene so as to
impose what it considers, with the benefit of hindsight and expert evidence, to be the appropriate actions. As Jonathan Parker J observed in Regentcrest Plcv Cohen [2001] 2 BCLC 80,
The question is not whether, viewed objectively by the court, the particular act or omission
which is challenged was in fact in the interests of the company; still less is the question whether
the court, had it been in the position of the director at the relevant time, might have acted differently. Rather the question is whether the director honestly believed that his act or omission
was in the interests of the company. The issue is as to the directorâ€™s state of mind. No doubt,
where it is clear that the act or omission under challenge resulted in substantial detriment to the
company, the director will have a harder task persuading the court that he honestly believed it
to be in the companyâ€™s interest; but that does not detract from the subjective nature of the test.
Turning to the concept of â€˜success of the companyâ€™, then s 172 includes an important phrase
which has, for some time, been the subject of debate; â€˜for the benefit of its members as a
wholeâ€™. In other words, the actions of a companyâ€™s directors must take account of not only
the shareholders but also the company as a separate legal entity. This latter aspect, though
relatively easy to understand, is nevertheless quite challenging to analyse, especially in terms
of posing the question â€˜What is best for the company as a separate legal entity?â€™ This in turn
usually leads to a consideration of the interests of current and future shareholders, before
being extended so as to consider other stakeholders in the company. Section 172 addresses this
issue by focusing upon the â€˜members as a wholeâ€™ and then, separately, as an additional list of
considerations, itemises the companyâ€™s stakeholders.
The result is that with this new statutory duty, a court may, at least initially, follow the reasoning set out by Goulding J in Mutual Life Insurance Co of New Yorkv Rank Organisation
Ltd [1985] BCLC 11, in that the powers outlined in a companyâ€™s constitution to its directors
are subject to two implied considerations: â€˜First, the time-honoured rule that the directorâ€™s
powers are to be exercised in good faith in the interests of the company, and secondly, that
they must be exercised fairly between different shareholders.â€™
However, while directors do not, in general, owe any contractual or fiduciary duties directly
to members of their company (Percival v Wright, 1902, see below), the situation becomes
slightly more complex in situations involving a takeover situation. First of all, there appears
to be a duty to shareholders in regard to the advice, if any, given by directors to those shareholders in regard to the acquisition or rejection of a takeover bid. Company legislation does

Duty to promote the success of the company
not deal with this. However, in Gething vKilner [1972] 1 All ER 1166, it was said that in a
takeover the directors of the â€˜victimâ€™ company owe a duty to their shareholders to be honest
and not to mislead as by suppressing, for instance, professional advice recommending rejection, and that the court might grant an injunction where this had happened, to prevent the
bid going ahead. Where there are competing offers then the directors are not under a positive
duty to recommend and facilitate the acceptance of the highest offer (Dawson International
plcv Coats Patons plc [1988] SLT 854).
Percivalv Wright[1902] 2 Ch 421
The claimant wished to sell shares in the company and wrote to the secretary asking if he knew of
anyone willing to buy. After negotiations, the chairman of the board of directors arranged the purchase of 253 shares, 85 for himself and 84 for each of his fellow directors at a price based on the
claimantâ€™s valuation of Â£12 10s per share. The transfers were approved by the board and the transactions completed. The claimant subsequently discovered that prior to and during the negotiations
for the sale, a Mr Holden was also negotiating with the board for the purchase of the company for
resale to a new company, and was offering various prices for shares, all of which exceeded
Â£12 10s per share. No firm offer was ever made, and the negotiations ultimately proved abortive, and
the court was not satisfied that the board ever intended to sell. The claimant brought this action
against the directors asking for the sale of his shares to be set aside for non-disclosure.
Held- by Swinfen Eady J - the directors are not trustees for the individual shareholders and may
purchase their shares without disclosing pending negotiations for the sale of the company. A contrary view would mean that they could not buy or sell shares without disclosing negotiations, a premature disclosure of which might well be against the best interests of the company. There was no
unfair dealing since the shareholders in fact approached the directors and named their own price.
(i) The Criminal Justice Act 1993 would not seem to affect this decision since it does not apply its
insider dealing provisions to private dealings in shares but only to dealings on a recognised stock
exchange. In any case, the Act gives no civil claim but merely contains criminal sanctions.
(ii) It should not be assum ed that an obligation of trust and good faith may not arise if the circumstances require it. In Plattv Platt[1999] 2 BCLC 745 the High Court ruled that although the relationship between a company director and the shareholders of the company does not of itself give
rise to fiduciary duties, special circumstances may require the imposition of such a duty. Three
brothers - Colin, Denis and Keith Platt - were shareholders in an Essex company holding a BMW
dealership. Keith ran the business and held ordinary shares. Colin and Dennis, the claimants, did
not work in the business and held preference shares. The company did badly in the recession
of the early 1990s. By 1992 Keith was the only brother in touch with BMW and the only director
of the company. Keith misled his brothers by telling them that BMW was about to withdraw the
franchise and was urging him to sell. As a result, Colin and Denis transferred their preference
shares to Keith for Â£1. These transfers were said to be necessary to enable the business to be sold.
Subsequently profitable trading resumed and the business was not sold. Later BMW terminated
the franchise and the business was sold leaving net profits after all expenses of some Â£770,000.
Colin and Denis, who could not participate in those profits, claimed damages for misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty by Keith.
In particular, the court accepted the existence of a fiduciary duty in the circumstances. The
interpretation of Percival v Wright [1902] 2 Ch 421 as deciding that directors owe no fiduciary
duties to shareholders was not followed on the ground that the Percivalcase had been interpreted
too widely. Such a wide interpretation did not follow from the underlying facts in Percival.

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
(iii) In Peskinv Anderson[2001] 1 BCLC 372 the Court of Appeal affirmed that, in the absence of
a special relationship, directors do not owe a duty to individual shareholders to keep them constantly informed of all matters that might affect their position. Mr Peskin claimed damages against
the directors of the RAC because he resigned his membership before its demutualisation and
failed to get the consequent cash benefit. The directors had not disclosed from the beginning the
negotiations about and proposals for the demutualisation and the Court of Appeal ruled that they
were not required to do so. They had not been directed by the members to demutualise and were
not therefore negotiating on their behalf. This was a sensible decision because in such matters the
board must be left to formulate proposals which may at some stage be put to the members but
not as soon as the idea occurs and is moved forward.
Secondly, where a listed company is concerned, the Stock Exchange has introduced a code
of dealing for directors. The rules which the City Panel has laid down now have the force of
law. In addition, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers may issue and publish a reprimand for
insider dealing in the shares of a company prior to its takeover and this could have an adverse
âž¨ See p. 531 effect upon the career, particularly of a professional person (see Chapter 24 âž¨). The Stock
Exchange, in consultation with the CBI, published a Model Code for Securities Transactions,
to give guidance as to when it is proper for directors of listed companies to deal in the securities of the company. This Code received widespread acceptance and became part of the
Listing Agreement. The main principles of the Code have already been considered (see
âž¨ See p. 259 Chapter 13 âž¨).
Directors may become agents of the members for a particular transaction, in which case
the situation of agency gives rise to fiduciary duties.
Allenv Hyatt(1914) 30 TLR 444
In this case the directors induced the shareholders to give them options for the purchase of their
shares so that the directors might negotiate a sale of the shares to another company. The directors used the options to purchase the shares themselves and then resold them at a profit to the
other company.
Held- by the Privy Council - that the directors had made themselves agents for the shareholders
and must consequently account for the profit which they had obtained.
There are disadvantages in this agency arrangement. It was held by the House of Lords in Briess
vWoolley[1954] 1 All ER 909 that where shareholders employ the directors to negotiate a sale of
their shares, the shareholders will be vicariously liable in damages to the purchaser if the directors
fraudulently misrepresent the state of the companyâ€™s affairs to the purchaser of the shares.
Interests of the companyâ€™s employees
Turning now to the list of stakeholders contained in s 172(1), to whom the directors should
have regard when making decisions, it is important to emphasise the fact that while, for example, the interests of employees must be considered, the duty is owed not to the employees but
directly to the company. (The same situation existed under s 309 of the Companies Act 1985.)
It would, for example, be within the provision for the directors so to arrange the companyâ€™s
business as to save jobs, provided the companyâ€™s interests were also served in a reasonable

Duty to promote the success of the company
fashion. It would not be within it for the directors to carry on the companyâ€™s business at a loss
and put it at risk of liquidation in order to save jobs. There must be a balance of interests but
the interests of the employees must be considered.
The provisions cannot be enforced by employees unless they are also shareholders and
even then a shareholder will have to bring himself within one of the exceptions to Foss v
âž¨ See p. 289 Harbottle(see Chapter 15 âž¨). In normal circumstances a shareholder should be able to do
this on the grounds that if the directors are ignoring the employee provisions they are doing
an act contrary to law, i.e. an act contrary to the Companies Act 2006. However, unless there
is damage to the company the most which a shareholder would be entitled to would be a
declaration that the directors had failed to consider the interests of the employees in breach
of the Act. While accepting that one cannot predict how the courts will interpret these provisions it does appear to be a declaration of good intent and little more. It is unlikely that the
company will take action to enforce the duty.
The CA 2006 also provides that the powers of a company are deemed to include, if they do
not otherwise do so, the power to make provisions for its own or a subsidiaryâ€™s employees or
former employees when the company itself or that subsidiary:
(a) ceases to carry on the whole or any part of its undertaking; or
(b) transfers the whole or any part of its undertaking.
The Act specifically states that the exercise of that power need not be in the best interests
of the company. This provision therefore reverses the decision in Parke v Daily News Ltd
[1962] Ch 927. Briefly, the facts of that case were that the defendant company had sold
the major part of its business and proposed to use the proceeds to make payments to
employees by way of redundancy pay before such payments were required by law. However, the court held that such payments were not for the benefit of the company, but rather
for the benefit of the employees and, therefore, the company had no power to make the
Where a company has power to make provision for its employees only by reason of the CA
2006, then the exercise of the power must normally be approved by an ordinary (or written)
resolution. However, this does not apply if the memorandum or the articles contain a provision whereby the power can be exercised by a directorsâ€™ resolution or require its sanction by
a resolution other than an ordinary resolution of the company in general meeting, e.g. a
special resolution.
The resolution can be implemented by a liquidator even though it was passed before the
winding-up (Insolvency Act 1986, s 187). Furthermore, the power may be exercised by the
liquidator if the following conditions are complied with:
(a) the companyâ€™s liabilities have been fully satisfied;
(b) provision has been set aside for the costs of the winding-up;
(c) the exercise of the power has been approved either by such a resolution of the company
as is required by the companyâ€™s constitution or, if there is no such requirement, by an
ordinary (or written) resolution of the members; and
(d) any other relevant requirements of the memorandum or the articles have been complied
It should be noted that if any payment is made before the commencement of a windingup, then it must be made out of profits available for dividend as defined in the Companies
Act 2006. In any other situation it must be made out of those assets of the company that are

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
available to its members on its winding-up. In other words a payment cannot be made in
order to prejudice creditors.
In connection with the power of the liquidator to implement the above provisions, it
should be noted that s 167 of the Insolvency Act 1986 applies so that in a compulsory windingup the liquidator exercises this power like all his others subject to the control of the court,
and any creditor or contributory of the company may apply to the court with respect to the
liquidatorâ€™s exercise or proposed exercise of these powers if he does not agree with the way in
which things are being done. In a voluntary winding-up the liquidator may make an application to the court for directions under s 112 of the 1986 Act if he is in any doubt as to whether
he should exercise the above powers.
Since a company employer is bound in any case today to make basic redundancy payments
a common application of the above provisions would be where the company intends to make
redundancy payments, on a transfer of its business, which are in excess of the basic statutory
requirements.
Interests of the companyâ€™s creditors
In a solvent company the shareholders are entitled, as a general body, to be regarded as â€˜the
companyâ€™ when questions of the duty of directors arise. However, where a company is insolvent the interests of the creditors intrude. They have power, through insolvency procedures,
to control the companyâ€™s assets which are, in a practical sense, their assets and not the shareholdersâ€™ assets.
Consequently, s 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 makes it quite clear that the focus of a
directorâ€™s duties will shift away from the â€˜members as a wholeâ€™ to that of the creditors when
the company becomes insolvent.
Liquidator of West Mercia Safetywear Ltdv Dodd[1988] BCLC 250
Mr A J Dodd was a director of two companies, West Mercia and A J Dodd Ltd. The bank account
of West Mercia was in credit while that of A J Dodd Ltd was considerably overdrawn. Both companies eventually went into insolvent liquidation and it then emerged that Mr Dodd had paid away
Â£4,000 of West Merciaâ€™s money to discharge a debt which it owed to A J Dodd Ltd at a time when
both companies were proceeding towards liquidation and the liquidator had instructed the directors not to operate either bank account. The advantage to Mr Dodd was that he had personally
guaranteed the overdraft of A J Dodd Ltd and the payment reduced his liability on the guarantee.
The Court of Appeal ordered Mr Dodd personally to repay the money to the liquidator of West
Mercia on the basis that he was in breach of his duty to the creditors of West Mercia.
A further example of a breach of duty to creditors and the company is to be found in the ruling
of the Court of Appeal in MacPherson v European Strategic Bureau Ltd (2000) The Times,
5 September. In that case three persons were members of the company. The relationship between
them broke down and the company was not a success. The director/shareholders made an agreement under which two of them were to leave the company under a contract that repaid money
owed to them being loans to finance the company and the profit from certain contracts of the
company. All of this was expressed to be for payment of consultancy services to the company.
The company later went to court to challenge the validity of the contracts. The Court of Appeal
eventually ruled:

Duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence
â— that the contractual arrangement though supported by consideration in terms of the consultancy was not binding on the company because it was not for its benefit. It amounted to an informal distribution of assets as on a winding-up without making provision for all the companyâ€™s
creditors. It was a breach of the directorsâ€™ duties and outside the powers of the company;
â— although the matter did not arise because the contractual arrangements were not binding on
the company, they were basically an infringement of the distribution rules of the 1985 Act since
they were not distributions of profit alone but also distributions of the companyâ€™s assets, which
was permitted by law only in a winding-up (see s 263(2)(d)), but, being remuneration not dividend, they were valid;
â— although it was not necessary in the circumstances to reach a definitive view, the arrangements
appeared to constitute unlawful assistance for the purchase of shares since it was clearly envisaged that the departing shareholders would transfer their shares to the remaining shareholder
with a material reduction in the net assets of the company.
Duty to exercise independent judgment
The statutory duty
Section 173 of the Companies Act provides:
1 A director of a company must exercise independent judgment.
2 This duty is not infringed by his acting:
(a) in accordance with an agreement duly entered into by the company that restricts the
future exercise of discretion by its directors, or
(b) in a way authorised by the companyâ€™s constitution.
The related common law and equitable principles
One of the most useful cases with respect to this duty is that of Boulting v Association of
Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians [1963] 2 QB 606, in which Lord Denning
It seems to me that no one, who has duties of a fiduciary nature to discharge, can be allowed to
enter into an engagement by which he binds himself to disregard those duties or to act inconsistently with them. No stipulation is lawful by which he agrees to carry out his duties in accordance with the instructions of another rather than on his own conscientious judgment; or by
which he agrees to subordinate the interests of those whom he must protect to the interests of
someone else.
Duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence
The statutory duty
Section 174 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a director of a company to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. It provides:

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
1 A director of a company must exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence.
2 This means the care, skill and diligence that would be exercised by a reasonably diligent
person with:
(a) the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person
carrying out the functions carried out by the director in relation to the company, and
(b) the general knowledge, skill and experience that the director has.
The related common law and equitable principles
It has been an accepted part of a directorâ€™s duties to the company that he owes a duty of care
to the company at common law not to act negligently in managing its affairs. The standard is
that of a reasonable man in looking after his own affairs, and it might fairly be said that the
earlier cases show that the duty is not a high one.
Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co[1925] Ch 407
In this case the chairman of the company committed frauds by purporting to buy Treasury bonds
just before the end of the accounting period and selling them just after the audit. By this method
a debt due to the company from a firm in which the chairman had an interest was considerably
reduced on the balance sheet by increasing the gilt-edged securities shown as assets. With regard
to the duty of auditors it was held that they might have been negligent in that they had not asked
for the production of the Treasury bonds but appeared to have trusted the chairman. However, they
were held not liable mainly because this was one item in a very large audit. The case does, however, show a movement towards a situation in which the auditors cannot necessarily implicitly trust
the companyâ€™s officers. The case is also concerned with the duties of directors in that it appeared
that the directors of this insurance company had left the management of its affairs almost entirely
to the chairman and it was perhaps because of this that he had more easily been able to perpetrate his frauds. In the course of his judgment, Romer J laid down the following duties of care
and skill required of directors, and the general view is that these are not unduly burdensome:
[...] (1) A director need no t exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may
reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience. A director of a life insurance
company, for instance, does not guarantee that he has the skill of an actuary or of a physician [...]
(2) A director is not bound to give continuous attention to the affairs of his company. His duties are
of an intermittent nature to be performed at periodical board meetings...He is not, however, bound
to attend all such meetings though he ought to attend whenever, in the circumstances, he is reasonably able to do so. (3) In respect of all duties that, having regard to the exigencies of business, and
the articles of association, may properly be left to some other official, a director is, in the absence of
grounds for suspicion, justified in trusting that official to perform such duties honestly.
A classic illustration of the above principles is to be found in the earlier Marquis of Buteâ€™s Case
[1892] 2 Ch 100 where the Marquis was made president of the Cardiff Savings Bank at six months
old by inheriting the office from his father. He attended one board meeting in 38 years and was
held by Stirling J not liable for certain irregularities in the lending operations of the bank.
However, in modern times when the directors of companies are often experts in certain
fields, e.g. accounting, finance or engineering, a higher standard of competence may now
be expected of them in their own sphere. Certainly directors employed by companies in a

Duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence
professional capacity, i.e. executive directors, have a higher objective standard of care to
comply with (see Lister vRomford Ice and Cold Storage Co[1957] 1 All ER 125), and so have
non-executive directors who are qualified or experienced in a relevant discipline.
Dorchester Finance Co Ltdv Stebbing[1989] BCLC 498
On 22 July 1977 Foster J dealt, in the Chancery Division, with this case which concerned the duties
of skill and care of company directors. The decision was not initially reported, which is unfortunate
since it seems to be the first decision in this area of the law since Re City Equitable Fire Insurance
Co Ltd. The case concerned a money lending company, Dorchester Finance, which at all material
times had three directors. Only one, S, was involved in the affairs of the company on a full-time
basis. No board meetings were held and P and H, the other directors, made only rare visits to the
companyâ€™s premises. S and P were qualified accountants and H had considerable accountancy
experience, though he was in fact unqualified. It appeared that S caused the company to make
loans to other persons and companies with whom he had some connection or dealing, and that he
was able to achieve this, in part at least, because P and H signed cheques on the companyâ€™s
account in blank at his request. The loans did not comply with the Moneylenders Acts and adequate securities were not taken so that the loans could not be recovered by the company which
then brought an action against the three directors for alleged negligence and misappropriation of
the companyâ€™s property.
Held - by Foster J - that all three directors were liable to damages. S, who was an executive
director, was held to have been grossly negligent and P and H were also held to have failed to
exhibit the necessary skill and care in the performance of their duties as non-executive directors,
even though the evidence showed that they had acted in good faith throughout. The decision is
of particular importance in regard to P and H because the judge appears to have applied a higher
standard for non-executive directors than that laid down in the Re City Equitable case. In particular, the judge rejected any defence based upon non-feasance, i.e. the omission of an act which
a person is bound by law to do. Contrary to Re City Equitable, therefore, it would seem from
this case to be unreasonable for a non-executive director not to attend board meetings or to show
any interest in the companyâ€™s affairs and merely rely on management, or, according to the judge,
on the competence and diligence of the companyâ€™s auditors.
It is not possible to say with certainty whether this decision affects the liability of non-executive
directors who are not qualified or experienced in a discipline relevant to company administration.
It was obviously of importance that P and H were experienced accountants and one would have
expected a more objective and higher standard to be applied to such persons, even in their capacity as non-executive directors. The matter is really one which should be dealt with by legislation
but there is nothing which is relevant to this problem in the Companies Act 1985. However, it is
worth noting that Foster J did not make any distinction between executive and non-executive
directors, stating that their duties were the same.
The UK standard of care is also being derived from the law relating to wrongful trading by
âž¨ See p. 554 directors. In particular, s 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (see further Chapter 25 âž¨) provides
for personal liability for directors in such amount as the court may decide in an insolvent
liquidation as a contribution to the companyâ€™s debts. The section is based on negligence and
the standard is objective. The qualified/experienced (or talented) director is judged by the
higher standard he ought to have but other directors are required to reach a level of competence to an objective standard. The court will consider current practice.

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
Of course, s 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 can only be applied specifically when the company is in insolvent liquidation but the standard required by the section has been cited particularly in Norman vTheodore Goddard[1992] BCLC 1028 and Re Dâ€™Jan of London [1994]
1 BLCL 561 as being an accurate statement of a directorâ€™s duty at common law which could
be applied more widely than in wrongful trading; in the Dâ€™Jan case, for example, to make a
director, who failed to read but signed an insurance proposal, which contained inaccurate
information and which was repudiated by the insurance company, potentially liable in negligence. Lord Justice Hoffman accepted that a directorâ€™s duty at common law is the same as that
set out in s 214.
Section 13 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 imposes an implied contractual
term that a supplier of a service acting in the course of business will carry out that service with
reasonable care. SI 1982/1771 provides that s 13 shall not apply to the services rendered by a
company director to his company. It is evidently thought to be enough that they have to act
in good faith, carry out fiduciary duties and meet the common law standard of reasonable
skill and care.
As regards the duty of directors not to act negligently so as to injure outsiders, the following case is relevant.
Thomas Saunders Partnershipv Harvey[1989] 30 Con LR 103
The claimants were architects who were retained on a project to refit office premises, one requirement being for raised access flooring. The defendant was a director of a subcontracting flooring
company. He was asked whether the flooring his company offered conformed to the relevant
specifications. He confirmed in writing that it did. In fact it did not and the architects were sued by
the end users for Â£75,000, the claim succeeding. They sought an indemnity from the defendant,
his company having gone into liquidation. The claim, part of which was based on negligence, succeeded even though the written confirmation had been given on behalf of and in the name of
the company. The defendant was a specialist in the field and had assumed a duty of care when
making the statement. He was liable in negligence. The judge did not see why the cloak of incorporation should affect liability for individual negligence.
(i) The decision has implications for companies whose products or services depend to a considerable extent on the skills and expertise of individual directors. In particular, firms of accountants
who are transferring from the partnership regime to the limited company regime may not find that
this affects their personal liability for negligence.
(ii) Much depends upon the facts of the case and in Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd
(1998) The Times, 1 May, the House of Lords decided that a managing director was not liable for
a negligent statement as to the profits likely to be made by the claimant under a franchise agreement. He made the statement on behalf of the company as its agent. Their Lordships said that in
order for the MD to be liable the claimant must show that he could reasonably rely on an assumption of personal liability by the MD so that a special relationship was created between the claimant
and the MD. The claimant had not, they said, established such a relationship. In particular, he did
not know the MD and had no significant pre-contractual dealings with him. Furthermore, there had
been no conduct by the MD which would have suggested to the claimant that the MD was accepting liability nor did the evidence show that the claimant believed he was. Nevertheless, if the special relationship can be established the court will in effect go behind the corporate structure and
find liability in those who are effectively in charge of the company. This, of course, gets around
limited liability and is particularly useful where the company is insolvent.

Duty to avoid conflicts of interest
(iii) As the above materials show, directors cannot be held personally liable for negligent misstatements unless a special relationship can be established between themselves and the claimant.
However, directors may be personally liable for fraudulent misstatements (the tort of deceit) irrespective of whether a special relationship is found to exist (see Standard Chartered Bank v
Pakistan National Shipping Co (No 2)[2003] 1 All ER 173). The criminal standard of proof applies
to civil claims for fraud, i.e. proof beyond a reasonable doubt so that it is notoriously difficult to
prove. It follows that it remains difficult to impose personal liability upon directors whether in
respect of negligent or fraudulent misstatements.
Where a person is a director of a number of companies that are within the same group
duties are owed to each company within the group individually (see Re Pantone 485 Ltd,
Miller vBain[2002] 1 BCLC 266).
What action can directors take to reduce the risk of claims for damage to the company
following â€˜badâ€™ business decisions? The following steps should be taken where it is thought
that, although the transaction is in general terms for the benefit of the company, there are
some risks:
â— take all proper advice which it is thought necessary;
â— document fully and clearly the reasons for the various decisions made;
â— enshrine these in the board minutes or other written document; and
â— in difficult cases consult the shareholders and ask them to formally approve the decisions
by ordinary (or written) resolution. Ratification by the shareholders should protect the
directors from the risk of subsequent proceedings by the company against them. Directors/
shareholders may vote and give this ratification unless, for example, they are seeking to
approve their own fraud.
If the above steps are taken, the directors could hardly be regarded as in breach of their
management duties and so could ratify the action as shareholders even if they held a majority of the membership votes (North West Transportation Co vBeatty(1887) 12 App Cas 589).
Duty to avoid conflicts of interest
The statutory duty
Section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 states:
1 A director of a company must avoid a situation in which he has, or can have, a direct or
indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the company.
2 This applies in particular to the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity
(and it is immaterial whether the company could take advantage of the property, information or opportunity).
3 This duty does not apply to a conflict of interest arising in relation to a transaction or
arrangement with the company.
4 This duty is not infringed:
(a) if the situation cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of
interest; or
(b) if the matter has been authorised by the directors.

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
5 Authorisation may be given by the directors:
(a) where the company is a private company and nothing in the companyâ€™s constitution
invalidates such authorisation, by the matter being proposed to and authorised by the
directors; or
(b) where the company is a public company and its constitution includes provision
enabling the directors to authorise the matter, by the matter being proposed to and
authorised by them in accordance with the constitution.
6 The authorisation is effective only if:
(a) any requirement as to the quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is
met without counting the director in question or any other interested director, and
(b) the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if their
votes had not been counted.
7 Any reference in this section to a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and duty
and a conflict of duties.
The related common law and equitable principles
A director must account to the company for any personal profit he may make in the course
of his dealing with the companyâ€™s property (which includes not only physical assets of the
company but also commercial information and opportunities). This is now embodied in ss
175 and 177 of the Companies Act 2006. Thus, if a director buys shares in the company at par
when the issue price is greater, he must account to the company for the difference; where he
has sold at a profit, he must account for the profit. Again, if a director receives gifts of money
or shares from the promoters of the company or from persons selling property to it, he must
account for these sums to the company. The reason for this is that there has been a conflict
of interest.
A company director is expected to undertake negotiations with a view to securing the greatestbenefit for the company, and he can hardly have done so if he was taking gifts from the
other party. He must also account for commissions received from persons who supply goods
to the company. In addition, a director who in the course of his employment obtains a contract for himself is liable to account to the company for the profit he makes, even if it can be
shown that the company would not necessarily have obtained the contract. The accountability
arises from the mere fact that a profit is made by the director; it is not a question of loss to the
Industrial Development Consultantsv Cooley[1972] 2 All ER 162
The defendant was an architect of considerable distinction and attainment in his own sphere.
He was employed as managing director by Industrial Development Consultants who provided
construction consultancy services for gas boards. The Eastern Gas Board were offering a lucrative
contract in regard to the building of four depots and IDC was very keen to obtain the business. The
defendant was acting for IDC in the matter and the Eastern Gas Board made it clear to the defendant that IDC would not obtain the contract because the officers of the Eastern Gas Board would
not engage a firm of consultants. The defendant realised that he had a good chance of obtaining
the contract for himself. He therefore represented to IDC that he was ill and because IDC were of
the opinion that the defendant was near to a nervous breakdown, he was allowed to terminate his
employment with them on short notice. Shortly afterwards the defendant took steps which resulted

Duty to avoid conflicts of interest
in his obtaining the Eastern Gas Board contracts for the four depots for himself. In this case IDC
sued the defendant for an account of the profits that he would make on the construction of the
four depots.
Held - by Roskill J - that the defendant had acted in breach of duty and must account. The fact
that IDC might not have obtained the contract itself was immaterial. Per Roskill J:
Therefore it cannot be said that it is anything like certain that the [claimants] would ever have got this
contract [...] on the other hand, there was always the possibility of the [claimants] persuading the
Eastern Gas Board to change their minds; and ironically enough, it would have been the defendantâ€™s
duty to try and persuade them to change their minds. It is a curious position under which he should
now say that the [claimants] suffered no loss because he would never have succeeded in persuading
them to change their minds.
The High Court ruled in Gencor ACP Ltdv Dalby[2000] 2 BCLC 734 that the fact that a fiduciary,
such as a director, has made a profit makes him liable to account for it to the company. Whether
the company would or would not have obtained the profit is irrelevant.
Regal (Hastings) Ltdv Gulliver[1942] 1 All ER 378
The Regal company owned one cinema and wished to buy two others with the object of selling all
three together. The Regal company formed a subsidiary so that the subsidiary could buy the
cinemas in question but the Regal company could not provide all the capital needed to purchase
them and the directors bought some of the shares in the subsidiary themselves thus providing the
necessary capital. The subsidiary company acquired the two cinemas and eventually the shares in
the Regal company and in the subsidiary were sold at a profit. The new controllers of the Regal
company then caused it to bring an action to recover the profit made.
Held - by the House of Lords - that the directors must account to the Regal company for the profit
on the grounds that it was only through the knowledge and opportunity they gained as directors
of that company that they were able to obtain the shares and consequently to make the profit. In
particular, the House of L ords stated that directors were liable to account to the company once it
was established:
(a) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it could properly
be said to have been done in the course of their management and in utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and
(b) that what they did resulted in a profit to themselves.
(i) This same question was considered by the House of Lords in Boardmanv Phipps[1967] 2 AC
46 where the Regalcase was followed. It is generally felt that the fiduciary duty to account which
was placed on the directors in these two cases is rather high. In the Regalcase the directors did
not have a majority of shares in the company. It would have been possible for them to obtain
ratification of their acts by the company in general meeting. Furthermore, it was always conceded
that they had acted in good faith and in full belief in the legality of their action, so that it had not
occurred to them to obtain the approval of a general meeting. It is also true to say that the directors had not deprived the company of any of its property. The shares in the subsidiary were bought
with their own money and those shares had never been the companyâ€™s property on the facts as
the court found them. It would seem that the mere possession of information which results from
the holding of office as a director is sufficient to raise the duty to account.

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
(ii) A further case in point is Re Bhullar Bros Ltd[2003] All ER (D) 445 (Mar). The company was a
family company running a grocery business from several properties. It also owned investment
properties. The two families involved fell out. They decided not to buy any more investment properties and to divide the assets of the company between them. Negotiations came to nothing
and one of the families asked the court to order the sale of the shares held by one family to the
other family or to the company under s 459 (unfair prejudice). The court refused a buy-out order.
However, it was discovered that two of the companyâ€™s directors had, while the company was still
trading, bought at an advantageous price two investment properties next to the companyâ€™s existing investment properties on their own behalf. The Court of Appeal ruled that the directors concerned held the newly acquired properties on a constructive trust for the company. The Court of
Appeal affirmed the ruling of the High Court that the properties should be transferred to the company at the price that was paid for them. As the appeal judgment says, whether the company could
or would have taken the opportunity to acquire the properties had it been aware of the facts
was not to the point. The existence of the opportunity was information that it was relevant for the
company to have and the directors concerned were under a fiduciary duty to communicate it to
the company.
A director is not accountable for the profits of a competing business which he may be running (Bell vLever Bros Ltd[1932] AC 161), unless the articles or his service contract expressly
so provide, but he will be accountable if he uses the companyâ€™s property in that business,
or if he uses its trade secrets, or induces the companyâ€™s customers to deal with him. Furthermore, a director of two or more companies takes the risk of an application under s 994,
CA 2006 (unfair prejudice) if he subordinates the interests of one company to those of the
other (Scottish CWS vMeyer[1958] 3 All ER 66). A director is not allowed, either during or
after service with a company, to use for his own purposes confidential information entrusted
to him by the company (Baker vGibbons[1972] 2 All ER 759).
The High Court has ruled that a director who, on leaving his company, persuaded former
clients to transfer their advertising business to a new company run by him had acted in breach
of his fiduciary duty. The diversion of clients was a misappropriation of the original companyâ€™s property and the director was liable for profits derived from that property (see CMS
Dolphin Ltd vSimonet Ltd [2001] 2 BCLC 704). The High Court has also ruled that a director who registered the companyâ€™s name as his own trademark was in breach of a fiduciary
duty to the company because the registration was in his own personal interest and in conflict
with the interests of the company (see Ball vEden Project Ltd, Eden Project vBall[2001] 1
BCLC 313).
It is, of course, possible for a directorâ€™s service contract to be so drafted as to debar him
from running a competing business, allowing the company to seek an injunction if such a
business was carried on. It might also justify dismissal if the contract was breached. By contrast, a shareholdersâ€™ agreement may provide individuals who are both members and directors of a company with control over the direction which the company is to take. As such, as
in the case of Wilkinson v West Coast Capital [2005] EWHC 3009, those directors may be able
to deny that a new venture could be classed as a â€˜corporate opportunityâ€™.
A director may keep a personal profit if the company consents, but the consent must be
given by the members in general meeting and not by the board, and a resolution in general
meeting may be rendered invalid as prejudicial to the minority, if the director concerned con-
âž¨ See p. 276 trols the voting in general meetings (Cook v Deeks, 1916, see Chapter 14 âž¨). Shareholder
approval can be given by the unanimous written resolution procedure though in such a case
there would be no question of the abuse of minority rights.

Duty to avoid conflicts of interest
However, a director may take advantage of a corporate opportunity on his own account if
his company has considered the same proposition and rejected it in good faith.
Peso Silver Mines Ltd (NPL)v Cropper(1966) 58 DLR (2d) 1
The board of directors of Peso was approached by a person named Dikson who wanted to sell to
Peso 126 prospecting claims near to the companyâ€™s own property. The board of Peso rejected this
proposal after bona fide consideration. However, a syndicate was then formed by Pesoâ€™s geologist to purchase Diksonâ€™s claim. A company called Cross Bow Mines Ltd was incorporated by the
syndicate for the purpose. Cropper was a director of Peso and had taken part in the earlier decision
of the Peso board and also become a shareholder in Cross Bow Mines. This action was brought
claiming that Cropper was accountable to Peso for the Cross Bow shares which he had obtained.
Held -by the Supreme Court of Canada - that he was not bound to account. On the facts, Cropper
and his co-directors had acted in good faith solely in the interest of Peso and with sound business
reasons for rejecting the offer. There was no evidence that Cropper had any confidential or other
information which he concealed from the board. The court also found that when Cropper was
approached to join the syndicate it was not in his capacity as a director of Peso but as an individual member of the public whom the syndicate was seeking to interest as a co-adventurer.
Finally, a director may choose to resign from a company so as to take up a corporate
opportunity on his own, raising the question as to whether this would amount to a conflict of interest. The answer is that directors may pursue private opportunities while working
for a company, though these would be subject to the duties outlined in ss 175 and 177 CA
2006; in particular the requirement to declare their activities to the company. (The key message should always be, â€˜if in doubt, discloseâ€™.) A more common situation with which the courts
are faced is where a director chooses to resign around the time that such a private venture is
commenced so that they are able to devote their attention to it.
There are a number of important cases in this area including Industrial Development
Consultants Ltd v Cooley [1972] 1 WLR 443, which involved an architect who pursued an
opportunity in his priv ate capacity. A more recent Court of Appeal case, Foster Bryant
Surveying Limitedv Bryant, Savernake Property Consultants Limited[2007] BCC 804, deals
with a situation whereby a director resigned his position and subsequently commenced new
work without breaching the conflicts rule. The judgment of Rix LJ also provides a good summary of the case law in this area.
Foster Bryant Surveying Limitedv Bryant, Savernake Property
Consultants Limited[2007] BCC 804
The appellant company (S) appealed against the decision that the respondent director (B) had not
been in breach of his fiduciary duties before his resignation had taken effect. S had been set up
by a chartered surveyor (F) who was the majority shareholder. S had an agreement to carry out all
the surveying and project management work for its largest client (C). F persuaded B, another
chartered surveyor, to join him as a director and shareholder of S. Bâ€™s wife also worked for S. Two
years later F had lost confidence in B and made Bâ€™s wife redundant. As a result B had resigned his
directorship. Before Bâ€™s resignation took effect C requested B to work for it under a retainer
arrangement. C offered to share its work between B and S but F declined. S brought a claim
against B. The judge found that B had been excluded from his role as director after his resignation,

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
that there had been no breach of fiduciary duty by B and that even if B had been in breach of fiduciary duty the company had suffered no loss as a result. S submitted that the judge had been
wrong to find that B had been excluded from discharging his role as a director of the company as
from his resignation, that he had been wrong not to recognise that what B did during his notice
period between resignation and departure was a breach of fiduciary duty, and that once that
breach was established, then a duty to account was inevitable and did not depend on the need
to establish any loss. PerRix LJ
At trial it was common ground between the parties that the synthesis of principles expounded by
Mr Livesey QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, in Hunter Kane Ltd v Watkins [2003]
EWHC 186 (Ch), which Mr Livesey had himself taken largely from the judgment of Lawrence Collins J
in CMSDolphin Ltdv Simonet [2002] BCC 600 and the authorities there cited and discussed, accurately stated the law. In this court in In Plus Group LtdvPyke[2002] EWCA Civ 370; [2003] BCC 332
Brooke LJ described the Simonet analysis as â€˜valuableâ€™. Mr Livesey said:
1. A director, while acting as such, has a fiduciary relationship with his company. That is he has
an obligation to deal towards it with loyalty, good faith and avoidance of the conflict of duty and
self-interest.
2. A requirement to avoid a conflict of duty and self-interest means that a director is precluded
from obtaining for himself, either secretly or without the informed approval of the company, any
property or business advantage either belonging to the company or for which it has been negotiating, especially where the director or officer is a participant in the negotiations.
3. A directorâ€™s power to resign from office is not a fiduciary power. He is entitled to resign even if
his resignation might have a disastrous effect on the business or reputation of the company.
4. A fiduciary relationship does not continue after the determination of the relationship which gives
rise to it. After the relationship is determined the director is in general not under the continuing
obligations which are the feature of the fiduciary relationship.
5. Acts done by the directors while the contract of employment subsists but which are preparatory to competition after it terminates are not necessarily in themselves a breach of the implied
term as to loyalty and fidelity.
6. Directors, no less than employees, acquire a general fund of skill, knowledge and expertise in
the course of their work, which is plainly in the public interest that they should be free to exploit it
in a new position. After ceasing the relationship by resignation or otherwise a director is in general
(and subject of course to any terms of the contract of employment) not prohibited from using his
general fund of skill and knowledge, the â€˜stock in tradeâ€™ of the knowledge he has acquired while a
director, even including such things as business contacts and personal connections made as a
result of his directorship.
7. A director is however precluded from acting in breach of the requirement at 2 above, even after
his resignation where the resignation may fairly be said to have been prompted or influenced by a
wish to acquire for himself any maturing business opportunities sought by the company and where
it was his position with the company rather than a fresh initiative that led him to the opportunity
which he later acquired.
8. In considering whether an act of a director breaches the preceding principle the factors to take
into account will include the factor of position or office held, the nature of the corporate opportunity, its ripeness, its specificness and the directorâ€™s relation to it, the amount of knowledge possessed, the circumstances in which it was obtained and whether it was special or indeed even
private, the factor of time in the continuation of the fiduciary duty where the alleged breach occurs
after termination of the relationship with the company and the circumstances under which the
breach was terminated, that is whether by retirement or resignation or discharge.
9. The underlying basis of the liability of a director who exploits after his resignation a maturing
business opportunity â€˜of the companyâ€™ is that the opportunity is to be treated as if it were the property of the company in relation to which the director had fiduciary duties. By seeking the exploit
the opportunity after resignation he is appropriating to himself that property. He is just as accountable as a trustee who retires without properly accounting for trust property.

Duty to avoid conflicts of interest
10. It follows that a director will not be in breach of the principle set out as point 7 above where
either the companyâ€™s hope of obtaining the contract was not a â€˜maturing business opportunityâ€™
and it was not pursuing further business orders nor where the directorâ€™s resignation was not itself
prompted or influenced by a wish to acquire the business for himself.
11. As regards breach of confidence, although while the contract of employment subsists a director or other employee may not use confidential information to the detriment of his employer, after
it ceases the director/employee may compete and may use know-how acquired in the course of
his employment (as distinct from trade secrets - although the distinction is sometimes difficult to
apply in practice).
In the present proceedings the principles with which we are most concerned are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and
It may be observed that the factual situation presented by this case falls uneasily between the
scenarios dealt with in that jurisprudence. This is not a case where a director has used corporate
property. It is not a case where a director has resigned in order to make use of a corporate opportunity. It is not a case where a director has solicited corporate business in competition with his company.
It is not a case where a director has acted in bad faith, deceitfully or clandestinely. It is, however, at
any rate arguably, a case where, by agreeing, while still a director, to work for Alliance after he ceased
to be a director, Mr Bryant was still obtaining for himself a business opportunity, possibly even existing
business, of the company, or putting himself in a position of conflict with the company, before he was
free to do so. Moreover, these events happened at a time of transition, after a forced resignation but
before the resignation had taken contractual effect, in circumstances where both parties might be
said to be in need of protection. It is possibly above all when a director is leaving that a company
needs the protection which the law relating to directorsâ€™ fiduciary duties provides. But it is also when
a director is forced out of his own company that he needs the protection that the law allows to someone who has thereafter to earn his living. Many of these considerations are discussed in the jurisprudence, but not in our particular setting.
Regal (Hastings) Ltdv Gulliver [1967] 2 AC 134n; [1942] 1 All ER 378 is perhaps in many ways
still the leading case. It was decided in the war and not reported otherwise than in the All England
Reports until it was printed in the Law Reports as a note to Boardmanv Phipps [1967] 2 AC 46. It is well
described in Gower and Daviesâ€™ Principles of Modern CompanyLaw(7th edn, 2003, Sweet & Maxwell)
at pp 417-418, where the observation is made that the decision illustrates the extreme severity of the
law but also that it possibly carries equitable principles to an inequitable conclusion...
It would thus seem that even though the directors had in fact been proved to have been acting
honestly, and even thou gh it had been in fact proved that the company had suffered no loss, the position must in law be regarded, for the safety of mankind, as though they had been acting secretly and
dishonestly, to the loss of their company, and no inquiry otherwise was to be permitted.
In other respects, however, that was a straightforward case where the directors had acquired their
personal profits by reason of and in the course of acting as directors of their company. As Viscount
Sankey said (at p 139E): â€˜At all material times they were directors and in a fiduciary position, and they
used and acted upon their exclusive knowledge acquired as such directors.â€™ Lord Russell pointed out
that they acquired their shares â€˜by reason and in course of their office of directorsâ€™ (at p 145F, see
also at p 149F). Lord Macmillan said that the critical findings of fact which the claimant company had
to establish were â€˜(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it
can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in utilisation of their
opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in a profit to
themselvesâ€™ (at p 153F). Lord Wright said that the stringent rule was that a director must account to
his company â€˜for any benefit which he obtains in the course of and owing to his directorshipâ€™ (at
p 156C). Lord Porter said that the shares were obtained by the directors â€˜by reason of their position as
directorsâ€™ (at p 158C) and that the relevant rule was that â€˜one occupying a position of trust must not
make a profit which he can acquire only by use of his fiduciary positionâ€™ (at p 158F).
Twenty-five years later a majority of the House of Lords applied Regal (Hastings) Ltdv Gulliverto
a somewhat similar situation in BoardmanvPhipps[1967] 2 AC 46, save that the defendants there
were a trustee and the solicitor of a trust rather than directors of a company, and the shares bought

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
by the defendants were bought from third parties. The defendants obtained a profit for themselves as
well as for their beneficiaries in buying shares where the trust would not have been able or willing to
do so, and had acted openly and honourably albeit mistakenly. On this occasion, however, their
Lordships, although agreed on the principle to be applied, were divided in its application. Lord Cohen
said that information was not property in the strict sense and that it did not follow that because an
agent acquired information and opportunity while acting in a fiduciary capacity he is accountable to
his principals for any profit that comes his way as the result of the use he makes of that information
and opportunity; that must depend on the facts of the case; but here in buying the shares the defendants were acting on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries and they had put themselves in a position of conflict or possible conflict with the interests of those whom they were bound to protect
(at pp 102-104). Lord Hodson thought that information could properly be described as property,
albeit each case must be decided on its own facts (at p 107). Lord Guest thought the same (at p 115).
However, Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Upjohn saw the matter differently, although they were agreed
on the great principles at stake.
In both those cases, what happened was that the defendants obtained a profit for themselves
out of property of their trust while acting as fiduciaries. However, the application of the underlying
principles, that fiduciaries must not profit from their role nor put themselves in a position of conflict
of interest, has raised problems in circumstances where a director resigns and reaps his profit after
resignation. A number of cases, considered by the judge below, have illustrated the problems...
The defendants were castigated as â€˜faithless fiduciariesâ€™. It was again irrelevant that the company
might not have obtained the contract, for the defendantsâ€™ liability was their gain rather than the companyâ€™s loss. Gower and Davies comment (at p 420) that in that passage Laskin J seems to have
favoured a flexibility greater than English case law allows. However, the decision on the facts appears
best encapsulated in the following extract from his judgment (at p 382):
An examination of the case law...shows the pervasiveness of a strict ethic in this area of the law.
In my opinion, this ethic disqualifies a director or senior officer from usurping for himself or diverting
to another person or company with whom or with which he is associated a maturing business opportunity which the company is actively pursuing; he is also precluded from so acting even after his
resignation where the resignation may fairly be said to have been prompted or influenced by a wish
to acquire for himself the opportunity sought by the company, orwhere it was his position with the
company rather than a fresh initiative that led him to the opportunity which he later acquired....
In CMS Dolphin Ltd v Simonet [2002] BCC 600 the relevant jurisprudence was carefully considered by Lawrence Collins J, as he then was. The director there resigned (without any notice) in order
to profit from the claimant companyâ€™s business. Having made plans in advance of resignation, after
his departure he immediately set up in competition, first in partnership and subsequently through a
new company. He approached the claimantâ€™s staff and clients, to draw them both to him. Before long,
the claimant had no staff and no clients. The director was found to be in breach of fiduciary duty and
liable to account. By resigning, he had exploited the maturing business opportunities of the claimant,
which were to be regarded as its property. The case made by the claimant and accepted by Lawrence
Collins J was that the director had been prompted or influenced to resign by a wish to acquire for
himself or his company the business opportunities which he had previously obtained or was actively
pursuing with the claimantâ€™s clients and had now actually diverted to his own profit.
Lawrence Collins J considered the legal principles at [84]-[97]. Having referred to Regal (Hastings)
vGulliver, he said that the case before him concerned the question of how far the principle of that
case, which concerned directors who were in office at the time of acquisition of the shares, extended
to: â€˜a director who resigns his office to take advantage of a business opportunity of which he has
knowledge as a result of his having been a directorâ€™.
He concluded:
In English law a directorâ€™s power to resign from office is not a fiduciary power. A director is entitled to resign even if his resignation might have a disastrous effect on the business or reputation
of the company. So also in English law, at least in general, a fiduciary obligation does not continue
after the determination of the relationship which gives rise to it (see A-Gv Blake[1998] Ch 439, at

Duty to avoid conflicts of interest
p 453, varied on other grounds [2001] 1 AC 268 (HL)). For the reasons given in Island Export
Finance Ltdv Umunnaa director may resign (subject, of course, to compliance with his contract
of employment) and he is not thereafter precluded from using his general fund of skill and knowledge, or his personal connections, to compete...In my judgment the underlying basis of the
liability of a director who exploits after his resignation a maturing business opportunity of the company is that the opportunity is to be treated as if it were property of the company in relation to
which the director had fiduciary duties.
In my judgment, Lawrence Collins J was not saying that the fiduciary duty survived the end of the relationship as director, but that the lack of good faith with which the future exploitation was planned
while still a director, and the resignation which was part of that dishonest plan, meant that there was
already then a breach of fiduciary duty, which resulted in the liability to account for the profits which,
albeit subsequently, but causally connected with that earlier fiduciary breach, were obtained from the
diversion of the companyâ€™s business property to the defendantâ€™s new enterprise.
In Plus Group Ltdv Pyke[2002] EWCA Civ 370; [2003] BCC 332, a rare case in this court, presents a somewhat novel position. There the claimant company sought over a period of many months,
but without success, to force the defendant director to resign following a bout of severe illness. The
relationship between him and his partner in the company completely broke down, and he was
deprived of any remuneration or information; he was also refused the repayment of his loans to the
company. But he steadfastly refused to resign. In this state, but while still a director, the defendant
set up his own company and began competing with the claimant, even to the extent of working for
its major client. Both trial court and this court held that there was no breach of fiduciary duty...
Finally, there have been two further cases in which the essence of the finding of a breach of fiduciary
duty has consisted in what the directors had done while directors, rather than in post-resignation
competition. Thus in British Midland Tool Ltdv Midland International Tooling Ltd[2003] EWHC 466
(Ch); [2003] 2 BCLC 523, the director who merely resigned in order to compete was not in breach,
but his three former colleague directors who remained and thereafter conspired with him to poach
the claimantâ€™s employees were in breach (Hart J, whose recent death is much mourned). And in
Shepherds Investments Ltdv Walters[2006] EWHC 836 (Ch); [2007] 2 BCLC 202 the directors were
found to have breached their fiduciary duties by reason of what they did while still directors in anticipation of the competition they planned after their resignations. In the latter case, Etherton J said:
What the cases show, and the parties before me agree, is that the precise point at which the
preparations for the establishment of the competing business by a director become unlawful will
depend on the actual facts of any particular case. In each case, the touchstone for what, on the
one hand, is permissible, and what, on the other hand, is impermissible unless consent is obtained
from the company or employer after full disclosure, is what, in the case of a director, will be in
breach of the fiduciary duties to which I have referred or, in the case of an employee, will be in
breach of the obligation of fidelity. It is obvious, for example, that merely making a decision to set
up a competing business at some point in the future and discussing such an idea with friends
and family would not of themselves be in conflict with the best interests of the company and the
employer. The consulting of lawyers and other professionals may, depending on the circumstances, equally be consistent with a directorâ€™s fiduciary duties and the employeeâ€™s obligation of
loyalty. At the other end of the spectrum, it is plain that soliciting customers of the company and
the employer or the actual carrying on of trade by a competing business would be in breach of the
duties of the director and the obligations of the employee...
The jurisprudence which I have considered above demonstrates, I think, that the summary is perceptive and useful. For my part, however, I would find it difficult accurately to encapsulate the circumstances in which a retiring director may or may not be found to have breached his fiduciary duty.
As has been frequently stated, the problem is highly fact sensitive. Perhaps for this reason, appeals
have been rare in themselves, and, of all the cases put before us, only Regal (Hastings)v Gulliver(not
a case about a retiring director) demonstrates success on appeal. There is no doubt that the twin principles, that a director must act towards his company with honesty, good faith, and loyalty and must
avoid any conflict of interest, are firmly in place, and are exacting requirements, exactingly enforced.

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
Whether, however, it remains true to say, as James LJ did in Parker v McKenna (cited in Regal
(Hastings)v Gulliver) that the principles are (always) â€˜inflexibleâ€™ and must be applied â€˜inexorablyâ€™ may
be in doubt, at any rate in this context. Such an inflexible rule, so inexorably applied might be thought
to have to carry all before it, in every circumstance. Nevertheless, the jurisprudence has shown that,
while the principles remain unamended, their application in different circumstances has required care
and sensitivity both to the facts and to other principles, such as that of personal freedom to compete,
where that does not intrude on the misuse of the companyâ€™s property whether in the form of business
opportunities or trade secrets. For reasons such as these, there has been some flexibility, both in the
reach and extent of the duties imposed and in the findings of liability or non-liability. The jurisprudence
also demonstrates, to my mind, that in the present context of retiring directors, where the critical line
between a defendant being or not being a director becomes hard to police, the courts have adopted
pragmatic solutions based on a common-sense and merits-based approach.
In my judgment, that is a sound approach, and one which reflects the equitable principles at the
root of these issues. Where directors are firmly in place and dealing with their companyâ€™s property, it
is understandable that the courts are reluctant to enquire into questions such as whether a conflict of
interest has in fact caused loss. Even so, considerations that equitable principles should not be permitted to become instruments of inequity have been voiced: see for instance Murad v Al-Saraj[2005]
EWCA Civ 959; [2005] WTLR 1573 at [82]-[84], [121]-[123], [156]-[158]; and see the solutions discussed in Gower and Daviesat pp 420-421. Where, however, directors retire, the circumstances in
which they do so are so various, as the cases considered above illustrate, that the courts have developed merits-based solutions. At one extreme (In Plus Groupv Pyke) the defendant is director in name
only. At the other extreme, the director has planned his resignation having in mind the destruction
of his company or at least the exploitation of its property in the form of business opportunities in
which he is currently involved (IDC, Canaero, Simonet, British Midland Tool). In the middle are more
nuanced cases which go both ways: in Shepherds Investmentsv Waltersthe combination of disloyalty, active promotion of the planned business, and exploitation of a business opportunity, all while
the directors remained in office, brought liability; in Umunna, Balston and Framlington, however,
where the resignations were unaccompanied by disloyalty, there was no liability.
On which side of the line does Mr Bryant fall?
Mr Bryantâ€™s resignation had no ulterior purpose. In human terms, and even though there was no
repudiation of the shareholdersâ€™ agreement, it was forced on him by Mr Fosterâ€™s hostile and truculent
manner and the sacking of Mrs Bryant. As soon as he was told that his wife was to be made redundant, Mr Bryant, not unreasonably, reacted by announcing his resignation. At that time his intention
was to find employment w ith a firm of chartered surveyors, in other words to retrace his steps. In this
important aspect, Mr Bryantâ€™s case has no connection or similarity with, for instance, Canaeroâ€™s
â€˜faithless fiduciariesâ€™.
All that Mr Bryant did was to agree to be retained by Alliance after his resignation became
effective. He did nothing more. His resignation was not planned with an ulterior motive. He did not
seek employment, or a retainer, or any business from Alliance. It was offered to him, it might be said
pressed upon him...
Moreover, in considering the claim for loss and damage, the judge was unable to identify any existing projects which had actually been subsequently transferred to Mr Bryant or his new company...
As for the extent of his fiduciary duties, it seems to me that the judgeâ€™s realistic findings as to the
position within the company after Mr Bryantâ€™s resignation makes it very arguable that, so long as he
remained honest and neither exploited nor took any property of the company, his duties extended no
further than that. To demand more while he is excluded from his role as a director appears to me to
be unrealistic and inequitable. As for the innocence of his resignation, although the matter may not
be free of doubt, it again seems well arguable on the authorities that it is critically opposed to liability to account, where there is no active competition or exploitation of company property while a
defendant remains a director. And as for a reassignment of projects, I have already pointed out that
the judge was unable to find that any existing company projects had been reassigned.
Held - Appeal dismissed.

Duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement
Duty not to accept benefits from third parties
The statutory duty
Section 176 of the Companies Act 2006, provides that:
1 A director of a company must not accept a benefit from a third party conferred by reason of:
(a) his being a director, or
(b) his doing (or not doing) anything as director.
2 A â€˜third partyâ€™ means a person other than the company, an associated body corporate or a
person acting on behalf of the company or an associated body corporate.
3 Benefits received by a director from a person by whom his services (as a director or otherwise) are provided to the company are not regarded as conferred by a third party.
4 This duty is not infringed if the acceptance of the benefit cannot reasonably be regarded as
likely to give rise to a conflict of interest.
5 Any reference in this section to a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and duty
and a conflict of duties.
Furthermore, according to s 170(2)(b), a person who ceases to be a director continues to
be subject â€˜to the duty in section 176 (duty not to accept benefits from third parties) as regards
things done or omitted by him before he ceased to be a directorâ€™.
Duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or
arrangement
The statutory duty
Section 177, CA 2006 re quires a director to declare any interest he or she may have in a proposed transaction or arrangement. The declaration goes to the nature and extent of the interest
but is only required if the director is aware of the interest.
1 If a director of a company is in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a proposed
transaction or arrangement with the company, he must declare the nature and extent of
that interest to the other directors.
2 The declaration may (but need not) be made:
(a) at a meeting of the directors, or
(b) by notice to the directors in accordance with:
(i) section 184 (notice in writing), or
(ii) section 185 (general notice).
3 If a declaration of interest under this section proves to be, or becomes, inaccurate or
incomplete, a further declaration must be made.
4 Any declaration required by this section must be made before the company enters into the
transaction or arrangement.
5 This section does not require a declaration of an interest of which the director is not
aware or where the director is not aware of the transaction or arrangement in question.

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
For this purpose a director is treated as being aware of matters of which he ought reasonably to be aware.
6 A director need not declare an interest:
(a) if it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest;
(b) if, or to the extent that, the other directors are already aware of it (and for this purpose
the other directors are treated as aware of anything of which they ought reasonably to
be aware); or
(c) if, or to the extent that, it concerns terms of his service contract that have been or are
to be considered:
(i) by a meeting of the directors, or
(ii) by a committee of the directors appointed for the purpose under the companyâ€™s
constitution.
This is supported by s 182, which deals with existing contracts (as distinct from proposed
transactions or agreements), and provides that:
1 Where a director of a company is in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a transaction or arrangement that has been entered into by the company; he must declare the nature
and extent of the interest to the other directors in accordance with this section.
This section does not apply if or to the extent that the interest has been declared under
s 177 (duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement).
2 The declaration must be made:
(a) at a meeting of the directors, or
(b) by notice in writing (see s 184), or
(c) by general notice (see s 185).
3 If a declaration of interest under this section proves to be, or becomes, inaccurate or
incomplete, a further declaration must be made.
4 Any declaration required by this section must be made as soon as is reasonably
practicable. Failure to comply with this requirement does not affect the underlying duty to
make the declaration.
5 This section does not require a declaration of an interest of which the director is not aware
or where the director is not aware of the transaction or arrangement in question.
For this purpose a director is treated as being aware of matters of which he ought
reasonably to be aware.
6 A director need not declare an interest under this section:
(a) if it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest;
(b) if, or to the extent that, the other directors are already aware of it (and for this purpose
the other directors are treated as aware of anything of which they ought reasonably to
be aware); or
(c) if, or to the extent that, it concerns terms of his service contract that have been or are
to be considered:
(i) by a meeting of the directors, or
(ii) by a committee of the directors appointed for the purpose under the companyâ€™s
constitution.
As may be noted from the provisions outlined above, if an interest has already been declared
under s 177, CA 2006, s 182 does not apply.

Effects of a breach of duty
The related common law and equitable principles
In many respects, the case law which is applicable to the interpretation and application of
CA 2006, s 177 overlaps to a considerable extent with that discussed in relation to s 175.
As such, it is recommended that the analysis undertaken earlier in this chapter is read in
conjunction with this section of the Companies Act 2006.
Effects of a breach of duty
1 The extent of liability
A director cannot be made liable for the acts of co-directors if he has not taken part in such
acts and he had no knowledge of them and the circumstances were not such as ought to have
aroused his suspicion. The fact that he does not attend all board meetings will not in itself
impose liability but habitual absence may do so and the duty may be higher for the executive
directors and qualified or experienced non-executive directors (see the Dorchester Finance
case on p. 391).
A director who is involved in a breach along with others is jointly and severally liable
with them and can be required to make good the whole loss with a contribution from his
co-directors. There would be no contribution, of course, where money was misappropriated
for his sole benefit.
As we have seen, the company can make a director account for any secret profit and a breach
will usually entitle the company to avoid any contract it may have made with him. Property taken
from the company can be recovered from the director if he still has it or from third parties to
whom he may have transferred it unless they have taken the property in good faith and for value.
The court may also grant an injunction where a directorâ€™s breach of duty is continuing or
merely threatened.
2 The company m ay ratify the breach
The company may by ordinary (or written) resolution waive a breach of duty by a director.
Thus, in Bamford vBamford[1969] 2 WLR 1107 the directors allotted shares to a company
which distributed their products. The object was to fight off a takeover bid because the distributors had agreed not to accept the bid. This was an improper exercise of the directorsâ€™
powers but the allotment was good because the members (excluding the distributorsâ€™ shares)
had passed an ordinary resolution ratifying what the directors had done.
3 Company indemnity
By reason of the provisions of the CA 2006 the ability of the company to indemnify directors
and managers (s 232) in regard to claims made against them was limited, indemnity could
be given in these cases where a criminal or civil claim was successfully defended so that the
person concerned had to bear his or her costs until the conclusion of the proceedings. Section
233 provides for the provision of insurance by the company to protect directors against the
liability that might arise from s 232 and s 234 indicates that s 232(2) does not apply to qualifying third party indemnity provisions.

Chapter 19 The duties of directors
4 Relief by the court
The court has power to grant relief to a director who has acted honestly and reasonably and
who ought, in all the circumstances, to be excused.
In Re Duomatic[1969] 1 All ER 161
The share capital of the company was made up of 100 Â£1 ordinary shares and 50,000 Â£1 nonvoting preference shares. At one time E, H and T held all the ordinary shares between them and in
addition were directors of the company. E and T did not consider that H was a good director.
Although they could have voted him off the board, they decided instead to pay him Â£4,000 to leave
the company perhaps largely because he was threatening to sue the company and generally to
cause trouble if he was removed against his will. On payment of the Â£4,000 H left transferring his
shares to E. No disclosure of the payment of the Â£4,000 was made in the companyâ€™s accounts.
It was also the practice for each director to draw remuneration as required and for the members to approve these drawings at the end of the year when the accounts were drawn up. The
amounts drawn were as follows:
In period A (E, T and H sole directors Â£10,151 paid to E
and ordinary shareholders) Â£5,510 paid to H.
In period B (E and T sole directors and Â£9,000 paid to E
ordinary shareholders) but no final accounts agreed.
In period C (when additional persons E informally agreed to limit his drawings to Â£60 per
had become shareholders) week but in fact drew approximately Â£100 per week.
The company then went into voluntary liquidation and the liquidator began proceedings against
E, H and T for:
(a) repayment of the sums paid to E and H as salaries on the ground that these had never been
approved in general meeting;
(b) repayment of the Â£4,000 paid to H for loss of office; and
(c) declarations that E and T had been guilty of misfeasance.
Held- by Buckley J - that:
(i) repayment of the sums of Â£10,151 and Â£5,510 could not be ordered since they had been made
with the approval of all the shareholders;
(ii) although E had not obtained the approval of all the shareholders to the payment of the Â£9,000,
final accounts not having been agreed, in the circumstances and in view of the general practice E
ought to be excused repayment of the Â£9,000;
(iii) since there had been no disclosure to the preference shareholders of the payment of Â£4,000
compensation to H as required by company legislation, E and T had misapplied the companyâ€™s
funds and were jointly and severally liable to repay the sums. Furthermore, H held the money on
trust for the company and if necessary could be required to repay it. E and T had not acted reasonably in this matter and could not be excused.
Ministerial â€˜eight-point guidanceâ€™

Essay questions
statements is an â€˜eight-point guidanceâ€™ for company directors, which will not have the force of
law. The points are of useful guidance to company directors who might not be fully familiar
with the legal obligations set forth in the CA 2006:
1 Act in the companyâ€™s best interests, taking everything you think relevant into account.
2 Obey the companyâ€™s constitution and decisions taken under it.
3 Be honest, and remember that the companyâ€™s property belongs to it and not to you or to
its shareholders.
4 Be diligent, careful and well-informed about the companyâ€™s affairs. If you have any special
skills or experience, use them.
5 Make sure the company keeps records of your decisions.
6 Remember that you remain responsible for the work you give to others.
7 Avoid situations where your interests conflict with those of the company. When in doubt
disclose potential conflicts quickly.
8 Seek external advice where necessary, particularly if the company is in financial difficulty.

7 Landrut plc is a property company. Its principal activity is buying land, building private houses
and selling those houses directly to the public.
Six directors form the board. The three executive directors are Jack, a solicitor, in charge
of the legal department; Jeremy, a quantity surveyor, responsible for land buying; Philip, the
third executive director, is in charge of advertising, marketing and house sales. The three nonexecutive directors are Joe (who founded the company 30 years ago with his brother Jim),
Helen (Jimâ€™s widow) and Sam (a retired accountant). Joe is chairman of the board.
The following situation s have arisen:
(i) The company recently purchased a small rectangular piece of building land for Â£500,000.
Although the land was surrounded on three sides by existing development, it appeared on
visual inspection to have access to the highway on the fourth. Jack dealt with the legal work
necessary to complete the purchase. It now appears that a routine inspection of the title
deeds would have revealed that a two-metre strip of land runs the length of the fourth side
preventing access to the highway and making development impossible. The owner of this
strip of land is willing to sell at a price of Â£100,000. Consider the liability to the company of
Jeremy and Jack.
(ii) The company developed and sold a small site of town houses. The houses were marketed
and quickly sold at Â£40,000 each. It is now clear that the houses were undervalued and
would have easily sold at Â£45,000. While the company did not make a loss on the development, its profit was only marginal rather than substantial. Consider the liability to the company of Philip and Sam.
(iii) Jeremy asks the board to consider purchasing two building sites: Toddmoor for Â£750,000
and Rawsum for Â£500,000. After full discussion, the board decides to proceed with the
purchase of Toddmoor and reject Rawsum. Joe later decides to buy Rawsum personally.
He does so and immediately resells the site for Â£600,000. Sam and Helen who remain silent

Vacation of office, disqualification
and personal liability

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
Adirector may vacate office for a variety of reasons.
Expiration of the period of office
The articles usually provide what the period of office shall be. Table A provides that at the first
annual general meeting all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general
meeting in every subsequent year one-third shall retire, or if their number is not three or a
multiple of three, then the number nearest to one-third shall retire from office. If the company has only two directors one of them will retire every year if Table Aapplies because one
is the nearest to two-thirds of the directors who are subject to the retirement by rotation rules.
A sole director must retire every year (Re David Moseley & Sons Ltd [1939] 2 All ER 791)
(but see below). The directors retiring will be those longest in office since their last election.
Difficulties may arise in the early years of the companyâ€™s life if all the directors were appointed
at the same time. If this is the case, those retiring must, by reason of Table A, be ascertained
by agreement between the board and on agreement failing, by drawing lots. It should be noted
that the model articles for private companies no longer demand retirement by rotation.
Directors of public companies are still subject to this in the module articles.
Table A provides that a retiring director shall be eligible for re-election, and further provides that if the office vacated by a director on retirement by rotation is not filled, the retiring
director shall, if he still offers himself for re-election, be deemed re-elected, unless the meeting expressly resolves not to fill the vacancy or unless the resolution for the re-election of such
director has been put to the meeting and lost.
The board may fill casual vacancies and appoint additional directors up to the maximum
in the articles. These persons must stand for re-election at the next AGM and do not count in
the one-third retiring, but are additional to that number. If not re-elected, they vacate office
under Table A at the end of the AGM. There is no deemed re-election as is the case with directors retiring by rotation. Furthermore, the managing director and directors holding any other
executive office, e.g. finance director, do not retire by rotation. They are subject to the terms
of their contracts but cannot be either managing director or executive director unless also
directors. Therefore, they cannot continue in post if they are removed as directors by the
members under s 168, CA 2006 or under a provision in the articles. They would normally
have a claim for breach of contract.
Since the current Table A and previous ones make the AGM the lynchpin of director retirement and re-election, private companies now existing under Table A may no longer have
retiring directors because CA 2006 no longer require a private company to hold an AGM.
They will stay in post unless they voluntarily resign or a member calls for a meeting to be held,
which is his right, at which to discuss the removal of a director, or a removal procedure in the
articles is used (s 303(3)).
Alternatively, companies wishing to dispense with the AGM requirement but still wanting
retirement by rotation would have to insert an article under which retirement by rotation
was triggered in some other way, e.g. by a date, such as, say, one-third to retire on 31 March
each year.
The Model Articles for Private Companies Limited by Shares did not make changes to the
way in which private companies may appoint directors either by ordinary resolution of the

Removal - under statute
shareholders or by decision of the directors. However, these Model Articles now cover the
position where a sole director who is also the sole shareholder dies. Finally, there is no time
limit for a director to retain office however they serve only until the next AGM on appointment by the board, as was the case under Article 79 of Table A.
In the Model Articles for Public Companies, public companies may appoint directors by
ordinary resolution or by decision of the directors. In relation to the requirement for retirement of the directors by rotation, re-election takes place every three years to ensure consistency with the Combined Code.
In neither the draft Model Articles for Private Companies Limited by Shares nor the draft
Model Articles for Public Companies is there a provision for the termination of a directorâ€™s
appointment for failure to attend meetings. Nor is there a more general provision under
which the appointment will terminate when all the other directors decide that the particular
director should be removed from office.
Removal - under statute
A company may by ordinary resolution in general meeting remove a director before the expiration of his period of office regardless of the way in which he was appointed and notwithstanding anything in its articles or in any agreement with him (CA 2006, ss 168 and 169),
though weighted voting rights may render the section ineffective. The written resolution procedure is not available for this purpose because the director has a right to put his case against
removal to the meeting (see below).
Bushellv Faith[1969] 1 All ER 1002
Mrs Bushell, Mr Faith and their sister, Dr Bayne, each owned 100 shares in a family company which
had an issued share capital of 300 fully paid shares of Â£1 each. The company had adopted Table A
for its articles of associat ion but a special Art 9 provided that, in the event of a resolution being
proposed at a general meeting for the removal of a director, any shares held by that director should
carry three votes per share.
Mr Faithâ€™s conduct as a director displeased his sisters and they requisitioned a general meeting at which an ordinary resolution was passed on a show of hands to remove him. Mr Faith
demanded a poll, contending that, in accordance with Art 9, his 100 shares carried 300 votes and
that therefore the resolution had been defeated by 300 votes to 200.
Mrs Bushell then claimed a declaration by the court that the resolution had been validly passed
and an injunction restraining her brother from acting as a director. Ungoed-Thomas J, at first
instance, granted the injunction holding that Art 9 was invalid because it infringed what is now CA
2006, s 168 and that therefore the resolution removing Mr Faith had been duly passed. The Court
of Appeal did not agree with the decision at first instance and allowed Mr Faithâ€™s appeal. In
particular, Russell LJ stated that a provision as to voting rights in the articles which has the effect
of making a special resolution to alter the articles incapable of being passed if a particular
shareholder or group of shareholders exercise his or their voting rights against it is not a provision
depriving the company of the power to alter its articles or any of them by special resolution, and
so does not contravene what is now s 9 and is valid. However, an article providing that no alteration shall be made in the articles without the consent of a particular person would be contrary to
s 9 and so would be invalid.

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
Mrs Bushellâ€™s appeal to the House of Lords ([1970] 1 All ER 53) was also dismissed, their
Lordships holding that the provisions of what is now CA 2006, s 168 did not prevent companies
from attaching special voting rights to certain shares for certain occasions, e.g. to directorsâ€™ shares
on a resolution at a general meeting for the removal of a director.
In the House of Lords, Lord Reid pointed to what is now Reg 2 of Table A as justifying the weighted
voting provisions. Table A, Reg 2 provides â€˜any share may be issued with such rights or restrictions as the company may by ordinary resolution determineâ€™. This to Lord Reid indicated that there
was no reason why shares should not have weighted voting rights if the company wished that to
be the position.
Special notice of 28 days to the company is required of the intention to move the resolution.
If the company calls a meeting for a date, say, 26 days after receipt of the special notice to foil
the attempt to remove, the notice is nevertheless regarded as valid under CA 2006, s 312(4).
Under s 312(4), the meeting at which the resolution to remove is to be considered must be
called with at least 21 daysâ€™ notice. It is not necessary that the person who served the special
notice should propose the resolution. This could be done, for example, by another member.
Removal under the articles
This power is in addition to any other means of removal that may be provided in the articles,
e.g. a power under which certain of the directors may remove others (Bersel Manufacturing
Co Ltdv Berry, 1968, see below). Thus, shareholders who wish to remove a director have a
choice: either they can proceed under CA 2006, s 168 or under a provision, if any, in the articles, and if the articles make removal more difficult, as where they require a special resolution,
then s 168 will be used. On the other hand, where the articles allow the directors themselves
to carry out the removal, as in Bersel Manufacturing Co Ltdv Berry, 1968 (see below), then,
of course, it would be easier to do it through the power vested in the board, first because the
articles do not require a membersâ€™ resolution to effect the removal but perhaps just a letter
signed by the companyâ€™s chairman and secretary and, second, because the article is unlikely
to give the director being removed rights of representation as s 168 does.
A quite common use of a clause in the articles setting out a means of removal of directors
is to be found in the articles of subsidiary companies where a removal clause allows the holding company to remove the directors of the subsidiary, something which cannot be achieved
under s 168 where removal must be by the members of the company of which the person
removed is a director.
Bersel Manufacturing Co Ltdv Berry[1968] 2 All ER 552
Berry and his wife were the first directors of a private company and were appointed permanent life
directors by Art 11 of the companyâ€™s articles of association. In addition, Art 16(H) provided that
â€˜The permanent life directors shall have power to terminate forthwith the directorship of any of the
ordinary directors by notice in writing.â€™ Mr Berryâ€™s wife died in 1962. The question before the court
in this case was whether or not the power given in Art 16(H) could only be exercised during the
joint lives of Mr Berry and his wife and ceased to be exercisable when she died.

Statutory removal - restrictions
Held- by the House of Lords - that the power was not vested in the permanent life directors as
recipients of a joint confidence but for the securing of their joint interests, and the principle that a
bare power could not be exercised by the survivor of joint holders did not apply. Furthermore, the
principle that a power annexed to an office passed to successive holders of the office was not conclusive since the office in question died with the death of the survivor of the two occupants of the
power. Therefore, on a true construction of the articles the power conferred by Art 16(H) remained
exercisable by Mr Berry after the death of his wife. In these circumstances it was possible for
Mr Berry to terminate the directorship of any of the ordinary directors by a notice in writing.
The power to remove a director in the articles is effective even if the directors who exercise the
power have acted with ulterior motives as in Leev Chou Wen Hsian[1984] 1 WLR 1202 where a
director who was asking for information about the companyâ€™s dealings and not receiving all the
information he wanted asked the secretary to convene a board meeting but was removed by the
other directors two days before the meeting under a power in the articles. A removal under s 168
would seem to be effective in a similar situation.
Statutory removal - restrictions
If the s 168 procedure is followed the director concerned is allowed to put his case to the
members by the circulation of his representations with the notice of the meeting, or if his
representations are received too late for this, they are to be read out at the meeting. The company is required under s 169 to send a copy of the special notice to the director concerned
forthwith.
The vacancy so created may be filled at the meeting, or if not so filled, may be filled as a
casual vacancy and any person appointed in the place of a director removed under s 168 shall
be deemed to hold office for as long as the director removed would have held it, and to retire
when he would have retired.
Nothing in s 168 is to deprive a director so removed of any action he may have for dismissal, as where he has a contract outside the articles appointing him for a specified period
which has not expired.
At first sight, s 168 appears to give any member of a company who is not satisfied with the
way in which a director is carrying out his duties the right to ask the members as a whole to
consider passing an ordinary resolution in general meeting to remove him.
Let us suppose, as would be usual, that X, a member of the company, chooses the annual
general meeting for this purpose. Let us further suppose that he serves special notice on the
company secretary in the proper manner of his intention to propose a resolution to remove
the director or directors concerned. Are the directors obliged to place that resolution on the
agenda and take it at the annual general meeting? According to the decision of Slade J in
Pedley v Inland Waterways Association Ltd[1977] 1 All ER 209, the answer is no, unless, that
is, X or persons joining with him satisfy the requirements of CA 2006, ss 314 et al.
This section provides that members representing not less than one-twentieth of the total
voting rights of all members or 100 or more members holding shares in the company on
which there has been paid up an average of not less than Â£100 per member can, by making
a written requisition to the company, compel the company in effect to put a particular item of
business up at the annual general meeting.

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
Therefore, if a particular member or members cannot satisfy, e.g. the one-twentieth voting
rights provision, then the directors are not obliged to raise the question of the removal of one
or more of their number at the annual general meeting. Thus, it would seem that the rights
given by s 168, and indeed CA 2006, s 510 (power to remove auditors), are much more
restricted than might hitherto have been thought. It is impossible to use these sections unless
the member or members concerned can satisfy the requirements of CA 2006, s 338 (at least
so far as the annual general meeting is concerned).
Although the Pedleycase dealt only with matters regarding the removal of a director at the
annual general meeting it would seem that an individual member is in a similar position if he
wishes to remove a director between annual general meetings. Unless the board is willing to
call an extraordinary general meeting, he or members joining with him will have to do so.
This can be done under CA 2006, s 303, but only by members holding not less than one-tenth
of such of the companyâ€™s paid-up capital as carries voting rights at the general meetings of the
Resignation
A resignation need not be in writing; thus an oral resignation at a board meeting is effective.
Once resignation has been made it cannot be withdrawn except with the consent of those
persons who are entitled to appoint new directors.
Winding-up
The position is as follows:
(a) In a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up
Here the company is necessarily solvent and the directorsâ€™ powers cease only on the appointment of a liquidator, not when the resolution to wind up is passed. However, the members or
the liquidator may sanction the continuance of the directorsâ€™ powers (Insolvency Act 1986, s
91). The directors may decide to resign, but if they do not their powers remain in suspense
until they would have retired by rotation and obviously they cannot be re-elected (Re Zinotty
Properties Ltd [1984] 3 All ER 754). Executive directors may claim redundancy or unfair
dismissal as the case may be under the usual employment law rules. There could also be a claim
for wrongful dismissal at common law.
(b) In a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up
Here the company is necessarily insolvent. The directorsâ€™ powers cease on the appointment
of a liquidator. They may resign but if not they vacate office as in (a) above. The position of
executive directors is also as in (a) above.
If a resolution for a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up is passed without a liquidator being
appointed, the directorsâ€™ powers are limited under s 114 of the Insolvency Act 1986, e.g. to the
âž¨ See p. 593 disposal of perishable goods (see further Chapter 27 âž¨).

Appointment of an administrator/administrative receiver
Although the directorsâ€™ powers cease on the appointment of a liquidator, the liquidation
committee or, if none, the creditors can approve the continuance of the directorsâ€™ powers in
whole or in part (s 103 of the 1986 Act). To do so would be rare.
(c) In a compulsory winding-up
The directorsâ€™ powers cease on the making of a winding-up order or on the earlier appointment of a provisional liquidator. There is no mechanism whereby the directorsâ€™ powers can
be continued. The position of executive directors is as in (a) above.
Appointment of an administrator/administrative receiver
A major change effected by the Enterprise Act 2002 is to restrict the right of a creditor with a
full package of securities that includes a floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver.
There are a number of exceptions to the prohibition under which the holder of a floating
charge entered into after 15 September 2003 will retain the power to make such an appoint-
âž¨ See p. 554 ment. These will be dealt with in Chapter 25 âž¨. However it should be borne in mind that
many lenders, particularly banks, hold floating charges entered into before the above date and
may appoint administrative receivers as before. Thus for some time to come the law relating
to administrative receivers will be relevant in business. For this reason the following materials
have been retained at least for this edition.
On the appointment of an administrative receiver the powers of the directors effectively
cease. They are not dismissed, however, though the administrative receiver is entitled to continue the companyâ€™s business and realise its property without interference by the board
(Gomba Holdings UK Ltd vHoman[1986] 3 All ER 94). There may be rather special situations
in which the court will allow the directors to exercise their powers, as the following case shows.
Newhart Developments Ltdv Co-operative Commercial Bank Ltd
[1978] 2 All ER 896
A scheme for a housing development in North Wales was to be carried out by a company formed
specially for the purpose and jointly owned by Newhart Developments Ltd (Newhart) and the Cooperative Commercial Bank Ltd (the bank), finance being provided by the bank. The scheme got
into difficulties and the bank appointed a receiver of Newhart under the provisions of a debenture
in common form. In particular, clause 2(c) provided that the company should not deal with its
books or other debts or securities for money otherwise than by getting in and realising the same
in the ordinary course of business. Clause 5 provided that the receiver should have power to take
possession and collect and get in the property charged by the debenture and for that purpose to
take any proceedings in the name of the company or otherwise. Newhart took the view that they
might have a claim against the bank for breach of contract arising from the development scheme.
They issued a writ (claim form) and the bank applied to the court to have it set aside because it
had been issued by the directors of Newhart without the receiverâ€™s consent. The bankâ€™s application was successful in the High Court but Newhart appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed
the appeal thus enabling Newhartâ€™s claim to proceed to trial.
Shaw LJ said that the function of a receiver was to protect the interests of debenture holders;
he was not like a liquidator whose function was to wind the company up. During a liquidation

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
directors were divested of their powers but not so in a receivership. The fact that a receiver
had been appointed did not prevent the directors of the company concerned from exercising
their powers as the governing body of the company provided that their acts did not threaten the
assets which were subject to the debenture holdersâ€™ charge. In this case the receiver was put into
a curious and unenviable position because the action by Newhart was against the bank which
had appointed him. Nevertheless, where a receiver had in his discretion chosen to ignore an
asset, such as a right of action, there was nothing in law to prevent the directors pursuing it in the
companyâ€™s name. A company might have creditors other than the debenture holders and those
creditors were entitled to expect the directors to bring an action which, if successful, might provide a fund out of which to pay them. If the claim succeeded, the receiver would have an interest
in the disposition of any money received, but if he decided not to pursue a claim of this kind, the
directors could do so provided that nothing in the course of proceedings would influence the
security of the debenture holders.
Under the Insolvency Act 1986 the directors have an obligation to co-operate with an
administrative receiver, under the penalty of prosecution and a fine if they do not. Continued
refusal can result in a fine on a daily basis.
Directorsâ€™ powers are suspended during an administration. They must give way to the
administrator and in addition the administrator may remove them from office and appoint
new directors. However, they are not dismissed merely by the appointment of an administrator and retain some residual powers on the lines of the Newhart case. They retain their
Companies Acts duties in regard to the keeping of records. An administrator has no statutory
obligations in this regard.
Disqualification - generally
A director may become disqualified, and if so he automatically vacates office. The following
are the reasons for disqualification:
(a) Under a provision in the articles
Table A provides that the office of director shall be vacated if the director:
(i) ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of the Act, e.g. removal under CA 2006,
s 168; or becomes prohibited by law from being a director, e.g. is disqualified by the
(ii) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or compositions with his creditors generally; or
(iii) becomes of unsound mind; or
(iv) resigns his office by notice to the company; or
(v) has for more than six months been absent without permission of the directors from
meetings of the directors held during that period and the directors resolve that his office
shall be vacated. Under Table A one counts from the last meeting he attended and not
the first meeting that he missed. It should be noted also that this provision covers involuntary absence, as where the director is ill.
The articles may be altered to provide additional reasons for disqualification (Shuttleworth
âž¨ See p. 115 v Cox Bros, 1927, see Chapter 5 âž¨), though an express contract is not affected by alterations

Disqualification only
in the articles and the director may bring an action for wrongful dismissal (Southern
âž¨ See p. 115 Foundriesv Shirlaw, 1940, see Chapter 5 âž¨).
A more current example would be where the company is involved in financial services and
a director loses a licence or permission to act from a regulatory body such as the Financial
Services Authority.
(b) Share qualifications
The office of director is vacated if the director does not within two months from the date
of his appointment, or within such shorter time as may be fixed by the articles, obtain his
qualification shares, or if after the expiration of that time he ceases at any time to hold his
qualification where a qualification is required.
(c) Minimum age requirement
A director may become disqualified if his or her age is below the minimum age of 16 years.
This matter has already been dealt with previously (CA 2006, s 159).
(d) Bankruptcy
Where a director is disqualified because of bankruptcy he does not automatically vacate
office unless the articles provide as does Table A. Article 17 of the Model Articles for Private
Companies Limited by Shares provides an undischarged bankrupt is disqualified (unless they
have been given permission by the court to act for a particular company).
Disqualification by the court and personal liability
This section is based mainly on the provisions of the Company Directors Disqualification Act
1986 and section references are to that Act unless otherwise indicated.
Disqualification only
The following headings and their supporting paragraphs deal with areas where directors may
be disqualified but personal liability for the companyâ€™s debts is not involved.
Disqualification on conviction of an indictable offence (s 2)
The offence must be in connection with the promotion, formation, or management or liquidation of a company or with the receivership or management of a companyâ€™s property.
Disqualification is possible even though the indictable offence was tried summarily before
magistrates rather than by a jury in the Crown Court.
The court which convicts the offender can make the disqualification order. There is no
minimum period of disqualification. The maximum is five years in a magistratesâ€™ court and
15 years in a Crown or other court. There are no provisions relating to personal liability.
An example is Rv Corbin[1984] Crim LR 302. C set up in business selling yachts through
three companies. He obtained money and property by fraud, e.g. he obtained money from

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
two finance companies to buy yachts by falsely representing that a deposit had been paid on
them and took a part-payment for a yacht from a customer but the yacht never materialised.
He was sentenced to two and a half yearsâ€™ imprisonment and disqualified from acting as a
director for five years.
It should also be noted that there have been disqualifications in more recent times where a
director has been tried and convicted of an indictable offence under the Health and Safety at
Work Act 1974, for an infringement of health or safety requirements, which is a management
offence within s 2.
Disqualification for persistent breach of company law (ss 3 and 5)
A person may be disqualified following persistent default under company legislation, e.g. in
filing returns, accounts and other documents with the Registrar.
Persistent default is conclusively proved by three convictions (whether or not on the same
occasion) within a period of five years.
There is no minimum period, but the maximum, whether in a magistratesâ€™ or other court,
is five years. There are no provisions relating to personal liability.
Disqualification following the crime of fraudulent trading (s 4)
The court may make a disqualification order following an offence under CA 2006, s 993,
(crime of fraudulent trading). There is no minimum period but the maximum is 15 years.
There are no provisions for personal liability.
Disqualification for unfitness (ss 6, 7, 9 and Sch 1)
The court mustdisqualify a director (including a shadow director) on the application of the
Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) through the medium of the Trade Secretary
or the Official Receiver if the company concerned has become insolvent while the person concerned was a director (or subsequently) and his conduct makes him unfit to be concerned in
the management of a company. Insolvency arises under the Act from insolvent liquidation or
the making of an administration order or the appointment of an administrative receiver.
Liquidators, administrators and administrative receivers must report alleged unfitness to
The minimum period of disqualification is two years and the maximum is 15 years. There
is a time limit of two years from the date on which the company became insolvent, e.g. the
date when the company went into insolvent liquidation, during which an application must be
made, although the court can allow a later application.
The first check on the suitability of disqualification proceedings under these sections is the
BIS. The BIS may, not must, apply for disqualification. The second check is with the court
which must be satisfied as to unfitness. Schedule 1 sets out matters to be taken into account
when determining unfitness.
The Schedule, which is long, reflects the experience of the governmentâ€™s insolvency service
and the comments and experience of practitioners. It is concerned with the way in which the
directors have managed the company. It includes matters usually found when a company
has been badly managed by incompetent directors, e.g. failure to keep accounting records and
failure to send the annual return and to keep necessary registers.

Disqualification only
Schedule 1 is split into: Part I, matters applicable in all cases; and Part II, matters applicable where the company has become insolvent. This is to take care of disqualification after
inspection (see below) where the company need not be insolvent.
There are no provisions relating to personal liability for the debts of the company.
The case law indicates that unfitness has become divided into three main areas, i.e. (1) commercial immorality; (2) recklessness in management; and (3) gross incompetence.
Disqualification following Secretary of State investigation (s 8)
If it appears to the Secretary of State: (a) from a report made by inspectors under s 437 of the
Companies Act 1985 (provision for inspectors to make interim and final reports) or (b) from
information or documents obtained under s 447 (power to require production of documents)
or s 448 (regarding entry and search of premises) of the 1985 Act that (c) it is in the public
interest that a disqualification order should be made against a person who is or has been a
director or shadow director of any company, then (d) the Secretary of State may apply to the
court for such an order. The company need not be insolvent. The court must be satisfied that
the particular directorâ€™s conduct makes him unfit to manage a company and Sch 1 applies.
There is no minimum period of disqualification. The maximum is 15 years. There are no
provisions in s 8 relating to personal liability of directors.
Disqualification: some illustrative case law
The following cases in which the courts have interpreted the various sections of the Company
Directors Disqualification Act 1986 are included in order to enable the student to give examples of the application of the Act in the business context.
Nationality, residence and domicile
The High Court decided in Re Seagull Manufacturing Co (No 2)[1994] 2 All ER 767 that a
disqualification order may be made against a director regardless of his or her nationality and
current residence and domicile. Furthermore, the conduct leading to the disqualification
need not have occurred within the jurisdiction. In other words, you can run an English company badly from abroad. The director concerned was a British subject but at all material times
he was resident and domiciled in the Channel Islands. Nevertheless, he could be disqualified
under s 6 for unfitness. The relevant legislation contained no express jurisdiction requirement
or territorial distinction.
Director/secretaries
The High Court also decided in Re Pamstock Ltd[1994] 1 BCLC 716 that a director who was
also the secretary of the company could be disqualified as much for failure to perform his
duties as secretary as those of a director. The company had two directors and one was also
the company secretary. It traded beyond the point at which it should have ceased to do so and
went into insolvent liquidation. The judge said that as the company secretary one of the directors had failed to ensure that accounts and returns were filed on time and that an adequate
system of management was put in place. These were serious defaults which must be taken into
account when dealing with the period of disqualification. This implies that it was the directorâ€™s
failure to carry out his duties as a secretary that was at the root of his disqualification for
two years. There is, of course, no power to disqualify a company secretary from acting as such.

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
Inactive directors
It is also worth noting that it is not a defence to an application for a disqualification order that
the director concerned was not an active participant in the business of the company. Thus, in
Re Park House Properties Ltd[1997] 2 BCLC 530 the High Court disqualified three directors
as unfit by reason of irresponsible trading leading to insolvency even though they were inactive in the running of the business. The company was run by a husband but his wife, son
and daughter were also directors and shareholders but played no part in the running of the
business and did not receive a salary or fees. Having disqualified the husband for four years,
Neuberger J disqualified the other three directors for two years in each case, saying that a
director has legal duties and could not escape liability by saying that he or she knew nothing
about what was going on.
Conduct in collateral companies
The Court of Appeal has decided that in order to satisfy the requirements of s 6(1)(b) of the
Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 the director concerned must be a director of
the lead company which must be insolvent. However, his conduct in relation to other companies of which he is or has been a director may be taken into account. This conduct does
not have to be the same or similar to that in regard to the lead company, and the collateral
companies do not have to be insolvent, although the lead company must be. See Secretary of
State for Trade and Industryv Ivens[1997] BCLC 334.
Failure to keep proper accounting records and improper retention of
monies due to the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and National
Insurance contributions
The following case covers the above points and others and to that extent is probably one of
the most seminal cases on disqualification for unfitness.
Re Firedart Ltd, Official Receiverv Fairall[1994] 2 BCLC 340
Mr Alan John Fairall was a director of Firedart which was an advertising agency. It began trading
in 1984 and went into insolvent liquidation in 1988. The Official Receiver as liquidator applied to
the court under s 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (Unfit Directors) for
Mr Fairall to be disqualified as a director. The main allegations against Mr Fairall were:
â— failure to maintain accounting records as required by ss 386 and 387 of the Companies Act
2006 (formerly CA 1985, ss 221et seq.);
â— trading through the company while it was insolvent;
â— the receipt of remuneration and benefits in kind which exceeded the level which the company
could be expected to bear; and
â— improper retention of monies due to the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and what is now
the Contributions Agency (NIC contributions).
In disqualifying Mr Fairall for six years, Mrs Justice Arden stated how essential it was for officers
of a company to ensure that proper accounting records are maintained. She said:
When directors do not maintain accounting records in accordance with the very specific requirements
of s 221 of the Companies Act 1985 they cannot know their companyâ€™s financial position with accuracy. There is, therefore, a risk that the situation is much worse than they know and that creditors will
suffer in consequence. Directors who permit this situation to arise must expect the conclusion to be

Disqualification only
drawn in an appropriate case that they are in consequence not fit to be concerned in the management of a company.
Also raised was the responsibility for maintenance of accounting records. On this the judge said:
Mr Fairall states that the companyâ€™s accountants maintained its accounting records from 31 January
1987. The accountants however say that they were not responsible for writing up the books prior to
August 1987. However that may be I accept the submission on behalf of the Official Receiver that
it was Mr Fairall who was responsible for providing information to the accountants to enable the
accounting records to be maintained accurately and up to date. I further find that he did not provide
all the necessary information and explanations, that there is no excuse for his failure to do so and that
therefore he is responsible for the deficiencies in the accounting records even after the firm of
accountants had been instructed to carry out the bookkeeping function for the company. According
to Terence Anthony Price, a partner in or proprietor of Firedartâ€™s accountants, the flow of information
from Mr Fairall was â€˜spasmodicâ€™ and Mr Fairall was always too busy to provide any necessary explanations. I accept this evidence.
(i) It is of interest that the court affirmed that it is the duty of the directors to keep and supply
accounting information and that the duty cannot be avoided merely by employing accountants.
(ii) The necessity for directors to make use of and understand the companyâ€™s accounts was also
stressed in Re Continental Assurance Co of London plc[1996] 28 LS Gaz 29. The High Court disqualified a corporate financier from acting as a director for three years because in his role as a nonexecutive director he failed to read the companyâ€™s accounts (which he would have understood)
and so did not discover illegal loans made to acquire the companyâ€™s own shares constituting illegal
financial assistance contrary to s 151 of the Companies Act 1985 (now CA 2006, s 678).
(iii)The disqualification regime is important to lawyers and accountants engaged in insolvency
practice. For those in business as directors the cases represent a â€˜warning orderâ€™ as to what to
avoid to prevent disqualification. For professionals in general and audit practice they are less
important in that they will normally have resigned some time before insolvency proceedings take
place. A wise professional will not stay long with a board that fails to keep accounting records and
file accounts!
Pleas in mitigation
As regards pleas in mitigation by directors in connection with disqualification case law
indicates that the following might be successful:
â— reliance on professional directors; thus where a board contains say a qualified accountant
the others being business amateurs, the court may excuse them while disqualifying the
accountant though the court will not in any case excuse sheer incompetence;
â— the effect on employees may be relevant in the sense that it will be difficult to run the company if the director is disqualified so that jobs may be lost.
Directorsâ€™ undertakings not to act
It was held by the High Court in Re Blackspur Group plc[1997] 1 WLR 710 that an undertaking by a director not to act as such or in the management of a company was not acceptable
to the court except possibly in exceptional circumstances. The court, therefore, would not
prevent the Secretary of State from proceeding with an application for disqualification merely
because the director concerned had given such an undertaking. A statutory amendment would
be required to allow the court to accept such an undertaking on a general basis. However, the

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
High Court did say that it would be desirable to amend the relevant legislation in order to give
an undertaking the same status and effect as an order under the 1986 Act. In Secretary of State
for Trade and Industryv Cleland[1997] 1 BCLC 437 the High Court did grant a stay of disqualification proceedings in return for an undertaking from a director that he would not work
as a director in the future. There were special circumstances in that the director was 60 years
of age and in poor health. Additionally, the Secretary of Stateâ€™s action was out of time and the
BIS were asking for an extension of time. The action failed.
The Insolvency Act 2000
The relevant legislation was amended by s 6 of the Insolvency Act 2000. This allows the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to accept from a director he considers unfit a consent to a period of disqualification without the need for court involvement. The directorâ€™s
undertaking suffices. The relevant periods of disqualification are as for those in court proceedings. The director concerned may subsequently apply to the court to vary the undertaking he has given. The Secretary of State is entitled to make acceptance of the undertaking
conditional on there being a statement giving the basis on which the director admits he is
unfit to be concerned in the management of a company (In re Blackspur Group plc (No 3)
(2001) The Times, 5 July). The reasons for unsuitability will normally emanate from the insolvency practitioner concerned who has recommended the disqualification.
The decision in Re Blackspur Group plc, 1997 (above) is largely overtaken by the Act
of 2000, as is Cleland since the normal procedure now would be to give an undertaking to
the Secretary of State not the court. The material is retained as explanatory of the use of
Insolvency Act 2000 procedure.
Disqualification and personal liability
Disqualification and personal liability for fraudulent and
wrongful trading (s 10)
The court may disqualify a director who has participated in fraudulent trading under s 213 of
the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986), or wrongful trading under s 214, IA 1986. There is no
minimum period, the maximum being 15 years.
Fraudulent trading
The crime of fraudulent trading in s 993, CA 2006 is now separated from the personal liability
section, which is in s 213, IA 1986. Criminal liability can arise whether the company is in
liquidation or not. Civil liability arises only if the company is wound up.
In the case of fraudulent trading and wrongful trading (see below) only the liquidator
may apply to the court for a declaration of civil liability, but all persons, knowingly parties
(including the directors), may have civil liability under s 213, IA 1986: for example, a creditor
or accountant or auditor of the company may be held liable if he has participated. Only
directors and shadow directors are liable under s 214, IA 1986 for wrongful trading. There
is thus no danger of auditors, bankers or other advisers who are merely mounting a rescue
campaign for the company becoming involved under s 214, IA 1986 unless they participate in

Disqualification and personal liability
management more than is necessary to carry out their functions, when they might be
regarded as shadow directors.
Since it is necessary to prove fraud under s 213, IA 1986, which is not an easy matter,
whereas only proof of negligence is required under s 214, IA 1986, it would appear that s 214,
which sets out the requirements for wrongful trading, will clearly become the main section for
directorsâ€™ personal liability.
There is no need for participation in the companyâ€™s management or business. Liability for
fraudulent trading and to contribute to the companyâ€™s assets may be incurred by a creditor
who accepts payment of his debt out of money that he knows has been obtained by the fraud
of the directors (see Morris v Banque Arabe et Inter-nationale Dâ€™Investissement SA (No 2)
(2000) The Times, 26 October).
It is important to note that s 213, IA 1986 requires that the business has been carried on to
defraud creditors. The fact that only one creditor has been defrauded does not satisfy the
definition of fraudulent trading ruled the Court of Appeal in Morphitesv Bernasconi[2003]
2 BCLC 53. In that case it was only the companyâ€™s landlord that was defrauded in regard to
payment of rent.
Wrongful trading generally
Section 214, IA 1986 sets out the requirements for wrongful trading. They are: (a) that the
company has gone into insolvent liquidation; (b) that at some time before the commencement of the winding-up the person concerned knew or ought to have concluded that there
was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation;
and (c) that the person concerned was a director or shadow director of the company at that
time. The court cannot make a declaration of civil liability where the time mentioned in (b)
above was before 28 April 1986.
If the requirements, (a) to (c) above, are satisfied the court may, on the application of the
liquidator, declare the person concerned liable to make such contribution (if any) to the companyâ€™s assets as the court thinks proper (see below).
The court will not make a declaration if satisfied that the person concerned took every step
that he ought to have taken, with a view to minimising the potential loss to the creditors.
The section is concerned with liability for negligence and the court is required to take into
account not only the directorâ€™s own knowledge, skill and experience, but also the skill and
experience that can be expected from a reasonably diligent director. The test is objective and
not subjective. Thus, a director may be liable even if he does his best if he falls below the
standard of the reasonably diligent director. The court will have to consider current practice.
In Re Produce Marketing Consortium Ltd[1989] 3 All ER I
The liquidator of Produce Marketing had asked the court for an order that Eric Peter David and
Ronald William Murphy, who were directors of the company, should contribute to the company
assets in his hands.
This followed a finding by the court that the two directors concerned were liable for wrongful
trading on the basis that they had pressed on with their insolvent companyâ€™s business in the unrealistic - but not fraudulent or dishonest - hope that it would eventually trade out of its difficulties.
Mr Justice Knox said the fact that wrongful trading was not based on fraud was not a reason
for giving a nominal or low figure of contribution. Having taken into account all the surrounding
circumstances - that the case was one of failure to appreciate what should have been clear rather

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
than a dishonest course of wrongdoing, that there had been occasions when positive untruths
were told, that a solemn warning from the companyâ€™s auditors in February 1987 that it was insolvent was ignored - a contribution of Â£75,000 plus interest was an appropriate contribution for the
directors to make. Mr David and Mr Murphy were jointly and severally liable for the payment of this
sum and, in addition, they were liable for the costs of the case.
(i) This was the first case to deal with compensation to the company for wrongful trading. It was
a significant breakthrough for creditors, since the assets available to them in the winding-up may
be considerably increased by a personal contribution from directors if, of course, they can pay it.
It does give a warning order to directors to take professional advice at the earliest possible date,
since this could be much cheaper than having to face the possibility of making contributions of
considerable amounts to the companyâ€™s assets in the event of a winding-up.
(ii) In an earlier decision, HallsvDavid and Another (1989) The Times, 18 February, the court had
decided that its power to forgive directors who had acted honestly and reasonably (see Chapter 17)
was not available in regard to wrongful trading.
The amount payable
In cases of wrongful trading the court may declare that the director(s) concerned should make
a personal contribution to the companyâ€™s assets if the liquidator of the company makes an
application. The amount of the contribution depends on the facts in each particular case and
the court is given a wide discretion. However, the general approach is that the directorsâ€™ personal contributions should be the amount by which the companyâ€™s assets have been depleted
by their conduct. As we have seen, the court can also make a disqualification order. However,
if the court does not make a declaration regarding personal liability, it cannot make a disqualification order.
Time limits
Section 214 does not straightforwardly contain any time limit on the liquidatorâ€™s ability to
bring such proceedings. The Court of Appeal has decided that it is six years from the cause of
action, i.e. the time at wh ich the relevant ingredients of wrongful trading could have been
established on the basis of the evidence.
Moorev Gadd[1997] 8 LSG 27
The liquidators of Farmizer (Products) Ltd brought proceedings under s 214 of the Insolvency Act
1986 against Mr Richard Gadd and Mrs Ada Gadd, the directors of the company, for a declaration
that they knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation and that they should make a contribution to the
assets of the company. The proceedings were brought more than six years after the cause of
action, i.e. the time when the relevant ingredients of wrongful trading could have been established
on the basis of the evidence. Counsel for the liquidators contended that the section did carry a
limitation period and, indeed, it does contain almost at the beginning, the phrase â€˜if in the course
of winding-upâ€™. Therefore, it was contended that so long as the company was in the course of
winding-up, which it was, the liquidators could ask the court for the declaration. The Court of
Appeal did not accept this contention on the basis that limitation periods are normally specific
and the expression â€˜in the course of winding-upâ€™ was markedly dissimilar to any other prescribed
period of limitation. The Court of Appeal went on to conclude that s 214 proceedings were

Disqualification and personal liability
proceedings for the recovery of a sum of money which the court declared the delinquent director(s)
liable to contribute to the assets of the company. This fell within s 9(1) of the Limitation Act 1980
which applies to proceedings to â€˜recover any sum recoverable by virtue of any enactmentâ€™ (in this
case the Insolvency Act 1986). The six-year limitation provision of s 9(1) of the 1980 Act applied
and therefore the liquidatorsâ€™ proceedings was struck out as time barred.
It should be noted that this case has no effect on the absence of time limits in cases of disqualification for unfitness already considered.
The â€˜every stepâ€™ defence
Directors may have a defence against personal liability for wrongful trading if they can show
that they took â€˜every stepâ€™ that a reasonably diligent person would have taken to minimise the
potential loss to creditors, once they knew (or ought to have known) that the company was
unlikely to avoid going into insolvent liquidation. If the directors can establish such a defence,
the court cannot make an order against them.
It may be difficult to satisfy the court that a particular director took â€˜every stepâ€™ or even
most of the steps and the court will have to take a view of conduct in all the circumstances of
the case. Taking every step may well involve immediate cessation of trading or, if the business
can be sold, it could mean the appointment of an administrator who will keep the company
going until it is sold. Certainly directors of companies which are in danger of insolvent liquidation should take competent professional advice at the earliest possible opportunity.
Abilities of a director
As we have seen, wrongful trading is concerned with liability for negligent mismanagement,
not dishonesty, though a dishonest person will, in most, if not every, case have been guilty also
of negligent mismanagement. The court has to assess what steps a director took (or ought to
have taken) when considering whether to apply the relief from liability. The court must take
into account the directorâ€™s conduct by the standard of a reasonably diligent person who has
the following abilities.
(a) General ability, i.e. the general knowledge, skill and experience that can reasonably be
expected of a person carrying out the same functions as the director. This is the lowest
standard allowed. Nevertheless, general incompetence will not be sanctioned. Thus directors may be liable even if they have done their best if their best was not good enough for
the office they held. Furthermore, it is no defence for directors to say that in fact they did
not carry out any functions such as attending board meetings because they will be judged
by the functions of the office with which they have been entrusted. The general knowledge, skill and experience to be expected for a director of a small company with limited
operations will be less than for the directors of bigger and more sophisticated organisations, although the courts have already decided that there are basic minimum standards
to be applied to everyone.
(b) Actual ability, i.e. the standard of a reasonably diligent person with the general knowledge, skill and experience that the director actually has. In this case the actual ability of
the director will be assessed. This introduces a higher standard for talented and professionally qualified or experienced directors. However, the reverse will not apply and
directors with less than average ability will be judged by the general standard even if they
are personally below it.

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
In summary, talented directors are judged by their own standards while incompetent
directors are judged by the standard of reasonably competent directors. The court will consider current standards of business practice.
Wrongful trading: profitable but undercapitalised companies
When discussing the matter of a directorâ€™s knowledge at a particular time of the companyâ€™s
insolvency and yet continuing to trade it is important to note the decision of the Court of
Appeal in Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Creegan [2002] 1 BCLC 99. It deals
essentially with what is meant by insolvency for this purpose. There are two forms of insolvency. One is balance sheet insolvency, i.e. the companyâ€™s liabilities exceed its assets. The second
is cash flow insolvency, i.e. where the company does not have sufficient funds coming in to
pay its creditors as they fall due. The Court of Appeal made clear in the above case that both
tests of insolvency must be satisfied and the director must know or ought to know that these
tests are not satisfied and yet continue to trade. Therefore, a company that is undercapitalised
but has at the particular time no cash flow problem can continue trading without the directors
being under threat of wrongful trading proceedings even though the situation may not be
desirable in general business terms.
Action by directors
There are several actions which directors can take to avoid disqualification and personal
liability if an insolvency were to ensue:
(a) Make sure that the board has up-to-date and adequate financial information. A mitigating factor for the court in deciding whether to disqualify directors or find them personally liable is whether the board has considered regular budgets and whether forecasts were
produced carefully, even if they turned out to be inaccurate.
(b) Seek professional accounting advice if there are any doubts about the financial position
of the company. If things have gone too far, an insolvency practitioner should be asked
to give advice on alternative insolvency procedures. If there is still hope for the company,
an administration order might be the solution so that ultimately there may be no need
for liquidation. The most common applicants for administration orders are directors
who hope that the appointment of an administrator may save their companies.
(c) Early warnings from the companyâ€™s auditors must be heeded. Directors have generally
found greater difficulty when asking the court for relief if they have not acted upon warnings from the companyâ€™s auditors about the financial state of the company.
(d) Any difficulties should be discussed fully at frequent board meetings and the board should
try to act unanimously. If one or two directors wish to stop trading but are overruled
by the majority who wish to carry on, then the majority may have difficulty later on in
justifying their decision to continue trading.
(e) The proceedings of board meetings should be minuted properly. Although board minutes
are not normally conclusive, they can be good evidence that a board exercised its functions properly.
(f) Resignation from the board is not usually an adequate response to a problem within the
company because a director must take â€˜every stepâ€™ to protect creditors. A director who
feels, however, that the rest of the board is inadvisedly but implacably determined to
continue trading in spite of insolvency or impending insolvency might usefully write to

Disqualification and personal liability
the board giving his view. If this produces no change and he resigns, the court might well
accept that resignation was the only course open to him. However, the High Court has
decided that a director of an insolvent company whose recommendations regarding necessary economies had been disregarded by the controlling directors was not necessarily
to be treated as unfit to be concerned in the management of a company under s 6(1)(b)
of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 simply because he failed to resign
from the board.
Re a Company (No 004803 of 1996) (1996)The Times, 2 December
Mr Taylor was employed as a bookkeeper of a company at an annual salary of Â£8,000 and was
also a director and 10 per cent shareholder of the company. As a result of a letter from the companyâ€™s bankers in October 1991, Mr Taylor had made recommendations to the company for
specific economies which would have given it a reasonable chance of trading out of its difficulties.
However, the other directors had refused to implement these recommendations. In September
1993 the company went into voluntary liquidation with a deficiency in excess of Â£100,000. The
Secretary of State had argued that Mr Taylor ought to have resigned his directorship by the end of
1992 and, in failing to do so, he should be treated as unfit to be concerned in the management of
a company under s 6(1)(b) of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. The district judge
did not agree, though he thought that perhaps Mr Taylor would have been wiser to resign since
by continuing to act as a director of an insolvent company he had exposed himself to potential
liability under s 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (wrongful trading). However, Mr Justice Chadwick
said that the district judge, against whose decision the BIS appealed, had properly considered the
question of Mr Taylorâ€™s personal responsibility. He had seen and heard both Mr Taylor and the
companyâ€™s auditor. A director who protested against further trading, because he thought that there
was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency, was entitled to remain on the board using his
influence to try to bring trading to an end. It was necessary to consider the purpose of a director
remaining in that capacity. If it could be shown that the only reason why he remained a director
was to draw his fee or preserve his status, then a court might think he lacked an appreciation of a
directorâ€™s duties and was unfit to be concerned in a companyâ€™s management. In this case the district judge in the lower court had not found Mr Taylor lacking in this way and therefore the original
decision was upheld. Mr Taylor was not disqualified.
(g) The court is bound to look more favourably on directors who have acted honestly and
have not tried to benefit themselves at the expense of creditors. The court is also likely
to take into account the willingness of directors to make a financial commitment to the
company. The court will also consider relevant personal circumstances, such as matrimonial difficulties or more general factors such as recession.
If a company becomes insolvent these days, its creditors have a better chance than ever of
gaining access to the private assets of the directors in order to increase the amount which
they are likely to receive. At the various creditorsâ€™ meetings, which must be held in insolvent
liquidation, creditors can impress upon the liquidator their wish to pursue the recovery
of money from the directors personally. Any cash received will be available for distribution
to the creditors and improve their position in terms of the dividend which the liquidator

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
Disqualification in other capacities (s 1)
It is worth noting that the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 provides that when
making a disqualification order the court can disqualify a person not only from acting as a
director but also from acting as a liquidator or administrator of a company, or from acting
as administrative receiver, or from being concerned in any way directly or indirectly in the
promotion, formation or management of a company. The legislation could, therefore, bear
very hard on accountant/directors who could be disqualified not only from membership of
the board but also from certain of their professional activities.
In this connection the Insolvency Act 2000 amended s 1 of the CDDA 1986 by providing
that an individual who is the subject of a disqualification order or undertaking cannot obtain
leave of the court to act as an insolvency practitioner. He may ask the court for leave to act as
a director.
Competition violation: disqualification of directors
The Enterprise Act 2002 applies and inserts new provisions into s 9 of the CDDA 1986.
A competition violation involves engaging in conduct that infringes any of the following:
â— Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998 (agreements preventing, restricting or distorting
competition, e.g. restricting retail outlets for goods);
â— Chapter II of the 1998 Act (abuse of a dominant position, e.g. monopoly trading); and
â— Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty that carry similar prohibitions.
â— The Office of Fair Trading makes application to the court for a disqualification order.
Register of disqualification orders
This register is kept by the Registrar of Companies. The public can inspect the register and see
the names of those currently disqualified from acting as directors. Obviously, the name is
removed at the end of the period of disqualification.
Personal liability only
Acting while disqualified or a bankrupt
By reason of s 15 a person who is disqualified and/or an undischarged bankrupt who becomes
involved in the management of a company is jointly and severally liable with the company
and any other person who is liable for the companyâ€™s debts under s 15 or under some other
section for such debts and other liabilities of the company as are incurred while the person
concerned was involved in management.
In order to prevent disqualified persons and undischarged bankrupts from running a
company through nominee managers, s 15 provides that anyone who acts or is willing to act
(without leave from the court) on instructions given by a person whom he knows, at the
time of acting or being willing to act, to be in either or both of the above categories, is also
jointly and severally liable for debts and other liabilities incurred while he was acting or
willing to act.

Personal liability only
The phoenix syndrome (IA 1986, s 216)
The purpose of this section is to prevent a practice under which company directors may contrive to mislead the public by utilising a company name which is the same as or similar to one
of a failed company of which they also were directors in order to conduct a virtually identical
The provisions used to prevent this forbid a director or shadow director of the failed company from being a director or shadow director of a company with the same or similar name and
business to the failed company for five years. If they infringe the above rules, they commit
a criminal offence and under s 217 of the IA 1986 are personally liable jointly and severally
for the debts of the second company during the period for which they managed it. If they
manage through nominees who are aware of the circumstances, the nominees are also jointly
and severally liable with the directors and shadow directors.
The court can, as in Penrosev Official Receiver[1996] 2 All ER 96, give exemption from
the above requirements and the business and its name can be sold by an insolvency practitioner and run by a new management. There is no objection to this.
Disqualification: can violation of s 216 be taken into account?
The High Court has ruled that when deciding whether to disqualify a director for unfitness
under s 6 of the CDDA 1986 the court may take into account the unauthorised use of a liquidated companyâ€™s name even though breach of s 216 does not appear in Sch 1 of the CDDA
1986. Schedule 1 was not exhaustive in terms of what the court could take into account (In re
Migration Services International Ltd [2000] 1 BCLC 666).
Directors and National Insurance contributions
The Social Security Act 1998 contains two powers to deal with problems caused by unscrupulous directors who fail to pay employeesâ€™ National Insurance contributions, as follows: those
found guilty of the new criminal offence could be imprisoned for up to seven years, or the
NIC debt can be transferred to the fraudulent or negligent directors as a personal debt. (See
s 64 of the Social Securi ty Act 1998, inserting ss 121C and 121D into the Social Security and
Administration Act 1982.)
Liability as a signatory, CA 2006, ss 82-85
Although the sanction of personal liability has been removed for failure to state the companyâ€™s name correctly on cheques, such a failure is not devoid of civil consequences, though
they are now visited wholly on the company.
Leave to act while disqualified
Section 17 of the CDDA 1986 gives the court power to grant leave to directors to act while
disqualified. In Re Westmid Services Ltd, Secretary of State for Trade and Industryv Griffiths
[1998] 2 All ER 124 the Court of Appeal gave guidance as to the exercise of the courtâ€™s discretion under s 17. This includes:
â— the age and state of health of the director;
â— the length of time he has been disqualified;
â— whether the offence was admitted;

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
â— the general conduct before and after the offence;
â— the periods of disqualification of the co-directors;
â— the responsibilities that the disqualified director wishes to take on.
It can also be helpful to a submission to the court for leave to act if a professional such as
a qualified accountant has joined or will join the board. A helpful case in ascertaining the
attitude of the court in the matter of granting or refusing leave appears below.
Re China Jazz Worldwide plc[2003] All ER (D) 66 (Jun)
The director concerned had been disqualified for five years for unfitness in regard to his directorship of China Jazz. He was a part-time director and had been for less than two years. There was
no remuneration. He was also employed as a director of four companies in the FM Group but could
not carry on in view of the disqualification. His duties in China Jazz had been undertaken in his
spare time. It was accepted that he had acted throughout with honesty and not for personal gain.
He asked the High Court to grant him leave to continue acting as a director of the FM Group companies and to have an involvement in the management of other companies. His application was
granted. The judge referred to relevant circumstances as follows:
â— He had not been disqualified for more than five years. If he had it would have been unlikely that
leave would have been granted.
â— He had acted honestly. Leave will not normally be granted otherwise.
â— The FM Group had procedures in place to ensure proper accountability. Leave is unlikely to be
granted otherwise.
â— There was evidence that the companies needed the services of the director and that he needed
to continue his career. Although there is case law suggesting that these matters are not a requirement of granting leave China Jazzaffirms that they are important and should be included
in an application for leave in appropriate circumstances.
Those who have given disqualification undertakings can also apply to the court to cancel or reduce the
period of disqualification. Presumably the above principles will guide the court in these applications.
Human rights and directors
The Human Rights Act 1998 came into force on 2 October 2000. It incorporates the European
Convention on Human Rights into UK law. The major impact is to allow human rights issues
to be brought before UK courts as distinct from a former requirement to take them to
the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. Importantly, UK courts are
required to interpret legislation in a way that is compatible with Convention rights. The likely
effect upon proceedings against directors is set out below.
Public authority
The 1998 Act makes it unlawful for a public authority to conduct its affairs in a way that is
incompatible with a Convention right. The expression â€˜public authorityâ€™ is defined widely and

Human rights and directors
includes government departments and regulators such as the Financial Services Authority as
well as courts and tribunals within the UK. The activities of these bodies insofar as they affect
directors will provide the major impact in this area.
Right to a fair trial (Art 6)
Article 6 of the Convention gives a right to access to justice and a fair trial in civil and
criminal matters by an independent and impartial tribunal within a reasonable time. Impact
on directors here will certainly take the form of protection against self-incrimination. In
Saunders v UK (1997) 23 EHRR 313 the European Court of Human Rights held that protection against self-incrimination was at the heart of fair procedure. Mr Saunders had been
compelled to give BIS inspectors information regarding the takeover by Guinness, of which
he was a director, of the Distillers Company. There were, among other things, allegations
of market abuse in the form of loans to individuals to buy Guinness shares so as to increase
the market price and make them more attractive to the shareholders of Distillers. When
criminal proceedings were later brought against Mr Saunders, the prosecution sought to
bring in the information as evidence but the ECHR decided that this would be contrary to
It can be seen from the Saunders case that Art 6 extends to cover the use of statements
made by the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Fraud Office acting under statutory
powers, such as the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. However, Art 6 does not apply
where the BIS investigation is not â€˜adjudicativeâ€™ in the sense that it reaches conclusions as
to liability. Thus in Fayed v UK (1994) The Times, 11 October, a report by BIS inspectors
into the takeover of the House of Fraser by the Fayed brothers stated that they lied about their
origins, but the European Court of Human Rights held that the report was not unlawful
under Art 6 because it was investigative rather than adjudicative, or administrative rather than
judicial, and in any case the limits of acceptable criticism of business people involved in the
affairs of large companies were wider than in cases involving private persons.
Article 6 also prohibits undue delay in investigating and determining proceedings.
Thus, in EDCv UK[1998] BCC 370 the ECHR ruled that disqualification proceedings that
had taken five years to conclude infringed Art 6 on the ground of unacceptable delay. In this
context it is worth noting that Art 6 may apply to BIS investigations which also take many
years to conclude.
The employment dimension
Employment law is thought by many to be the area of law where the 1998 Act will have most
impact. Directors should be aware of these ramifications as managers of staff. The most
significant rights of the Convention that are likely to be involved are in the following areas:
Prohibition of discrimination (Art 14)
The Convention may have the effect of widening the scope of discrimination in relation to
sexual orientation, religion, age and sexual identity.
Right to respect for private and family life (Art 8)
This area will, it seems, have the greatest impact on the employer/employee relationship,
involving access to medical records and employee surveillance.

Chapter 20 Vacation of office, disqualification and personal liability
Right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Art 9)
This may mean that employers will have to allow employees to hold controversial religious
or political beliefs and to have time off for religious purposes. Such rights, however, are
subject to the employment contract which, if freely negotiated, may exclude time off, as in
Stedman v UK (1997) 23 EHRR CD 168 where the ECHR rejected a claim by a Christian
required to work on Sunday on the grounds that she had signed a contract requiring her to
work on that day.
Right to freedom of expression (Art 10)
Employers will be able to insist that confidential information about the business is not
disclosed though â€˜whistleblowersâ€™ will be protected. It seems also that the employer will be
allowed to place reasonable restrictions on the clothes worn by and hairstyles of employees as
part of a dress code.
Essay questions
1 Melchester FC Ltd was incorporated by Albert Arkwright and Bertie Boozer in 1950. The company was set up to take over the running of Melchester FC, a Lancashire football club, who
were founder members of the Football League. Arkwright, at the age of 70, is still a director and
shareholder of the company. Bertie has since died with his shares passing on to his family who
have recently sold out to Loadsamoney and two associates, all three becoming directors of
the company.
Arkwright is deeply passionate about football and in particular has a strong affection for
Melchester FC, having spent a great deal of his childhood and adult life associated with the
club. Loadsamoney has expansionist plans for the club and is considering ways of merging
Melchester FC with Ambridge United, a rival team, and also to start up a professional basketball team, both of which will require a heavy investment.
Arkwright objects to Loadsamoneyâ€™s plans but finds himself outvoted on the board.
Loadsamoney considers that Arkwright can no longer serve a useful purpose. He decides to
remove him as director by securing an ordinary resolution at the next general meeting. Despite
his removal, Arkwright is still able to raise objections as a shareholder. His objections, however, go unheard and he receives minimal co-operation from the board in response to his
requests for information on the companyâ€™s plans. Loadsamoney, annoyed with Arkwrightâ€™s
interference, decides to make an offer to Arkwright to buy out his shareholding at a price fixed
by the board. Arkwright declines Loadsamoneyâ€™s offer, but finds himself faced with a proposal,
at an extraordinary meeting of the company, that the companyâ€™s articles be changed so that
any member can be requested by the board to transfer their shares to a nominated person at
a fair value.

Meetings and resolutions

General meetings of the company
Acompany may be required to hold certain meetings of shareholders, i.e. annual general
meetings and ordinary meetings. The articles of a company provide for the holding of
general meetings, the relevant provisions of Table Abeing in Regs 36 and 37.
Once the principles of meetings and resolutions in terms of paper communication have
been grasped, the reader will find it necessary to refer to the material relating to the introduction of new technology in terms of changes to the law to allow electronic communication
with shareholders.
General meetings of the company
1 Annual general meeting
The requirement for private companies to hold an annual general meeting has been abolished. Rather than holding a general meeting, private companies can use the written resolution procedure set out in Chapter 2 of Part 13 of the CA 2006. In relation to private
companies which are not traded companies, the CA 2006 does not require them to hold
annual general meetings. As the CA 2006 does not prohibit such a meeting, a company will
only need to hold annual general meetings where required to do so by its articles. This issue
will exist for private companies formed prior to 1 October 2007 who may wish to amend their
articles or adopt new ones to avoid the requirement to hold annual general meetings. A
private company that is a traded company is now required to hold annual general meetings.
CA 2006 makes separate provision for annual general meetings for public companies.
Section 336 has a requirement that the annual general meeting of a public company must be
held within six months of the end of a public companyâ€™s financial year (that is in each period
of six months beginning with the day following its accounting reference date) in addition to
any other meetings held during the period. This replaces the requirement that not more than
15 months must elapse between the date of one annual general meeting and the next, but so
long as a company holds its first annual general meeting within 18 months of its incorporation it need not hold it in the year of its incorporation or in the following year.
CA 1985, s 367 provided that, on the application of any member of a company, the Secretary
of State had the power to call, or direct the calling of, an annual general meeting where the
company had failed to hold an annual general meeting in accordance with section 366 of CA
1985. This provision has not been included in CA 2006.
There is no statutory provision which deals with the business which may be conducted at
the annual general meeting and Table A contains no such provision.
A matter that may be overlooked arises as a result of the provisions of Sch 13, Part IV para
29 which states that the register of directorsâ€™ interests must be produced at the commencement of the meeting and remain open and accessible during the continuance of the annual
general meeting to any person attending the meeting. This has now been repealed in 2007 and
not replaced.
The meeting is a safeguard for the shareholders in that it provides them with an opportunity of questioning the directors on the accounts and reports, which are usually, but not
necessarily, presented to the annual general meeting, and on general matters. Moreover, it is
a meeting which must be held whether the directors wish it or not, unless in a private company an elective resolution has been passed to dispense with the need to hold it.

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
2 General meetings
The CA 2006 does not refer to â€˜extraordinary general meetingsâ€™ as such a general meeting
which is not an annual general meeting should simply be referred to as a general meeting. The
court has power under CA 2006, s 306 (formerly CA 1985, s 371) to call a general meeting
if it is impractical to call one in the usual way, and the court may direct that one member of
the company present in person or by proxy shall be deemed to constitute a valid meeting.
An example of the use of CA 1985, s 371 is to be found in the following case.
Re British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection(1995) The Times, 3 March
It appeared that in 1994 an EGM had been so disrupted that a near riot had broken out as a result
of animosity between opposing factions within the Union and no business had been done. The
Unionâ€™s articles stated that no votes by proxy were allowed at AGMs or EGMs, but the committee
members of the Union wished to change that provision, allowing proxies so that it would be possible for members to vote without actually attending the meeting. The committee members asked
the court to direct them to hold an EGM at which only the 13 committee members would be present, i.e. 13 out of 9,000 members. The change to proxy voting could then be resolved upon at the
meeting. The court made the necessary direction under s 371. It was clearly not practical to hold
a meeting in the normal way or, in fact, at all.
(i) It may seem that the case is likely to apply in rather special and isolated situations but it could
be useful as a precedent where, in a private family company, opposing factions within the family
were making it difficult to do business. However, it should be borne in mind that the courts are
unlikely to use the section to suppress genuine and orderly debate.
(ii) Section 371 is not available to sort out disputes between shareholders simply because they
have equal shareholdings. It is available for quorum disputes as where A and B are the only shareholders in Boxo Ltd and, say, A will not attend general meetings so that there is no quorum and
business cannot proceed. In such a case the court can, under s 371, authorise a valid meeting with
only B present. However, if the problem is deadlock as where A and B each own 50 per cent of
the voting shares and business cannot proceed because A votes one way and B another, s 371 is
not available to enable the court to make an order allowing B to outvote A or vice versa (see Ross
v Telford [1998] 1 BCLC 82). Such a deadlock will, unless it can be resolved by agreement
between the parties, generally result in the liquidation of the company.
(iii)The decision in Rossmay be contrasted with Re Whitchurch Insurance Consultants Ltd[1993]
BCLC 1359 where the shareholdings were unequal. The issued capital was 1,000 shares, of which
the husband held 666 and the wife 334. Their personal and business relationship had broken
down. The wife would not attend board and general meetings so that there was no quorum and
the husband could not remove his wife from the board. The court ordered that a general meeting
be held without the wife because otherwise a minority shareholder would prevent the majority
shareholder from exercising majority power.
In addition, an auditor has the right to requisition a meeting on his resignation. Under CA
2006, s 518 where a resigning auditor has given a statement of the circumstances connected
with his resignation (in accordance with s 519), that auditor is entitled to call on the directors
of the company to convene a general meeting for the purposes of receiving and considering
âž¨ See p. 504 an explanation of those circumstances (see Chapter 23 âž¨), and a meeting must be called by
âž¨ See p. 162 a plc if there is a serious loss of capital pursuant CA 2006 s 656 (see Chapter 8 âž¨).

General meetings of the company
Convening of general meetings
General meetings are normally convened by the board of directors (CA 2006, s 302), though,
as noted above, the court has power to do so in certain circumstances. CA 2006, s 306 gives
the court power to order a meeting of the company and to direct the manner in which that
meeting is called, held and conducted. The court can order a general meeting on its own
motion or on the application of any director or any member who would be entitled to vote at
the meeting: section 306(2). If the articles contain provisions relating to the directorsâ€™ ability
to call general meetings, these cannot supersede CA 2006 by preventing the board from calling
general meetings.
The company secretary or other executive has no power to call general meetings unless the
board ratifies his act of doing so (Re State of Wyoming Syndicate[1901] 2 Ch 431).
As regards the time and place at which the meeting is to be held, this is in general terms
a matter for the directors. However, it must be reasonably convenient for the members to
attend and this probably prevents general meetings being held overseas. In addition, the
directors must act in good faith when they call a meeting. Thus, in Cannonv Trask(1875) LR
20 Eq 669 the directors called the annual general meeting at an earlier date than was usual for
the company to hold it in order to ensure that transfers of shares to certain persons who
opposed the board would not be registered in time so that they would be unable to vote.
An action for an injunction to stop the meeting succeeded. It should also be noted that once
the directors have called the meeting they cannot postpone it and the meeting may be held
even though the directors try to postpone or cancel it (Smithv Paringa Mines Ltd[1906] 2
Ch 193). With the consent of the majority of those present and voting it could, however, once
held, be adjourned.
Rights of minorities to requisition general meetings
The articles of a company usually provide that, apart from annual general meetings, meetings
of the company can be convened by the directors whenever they think fit. The directors are,
therefore, seldom under any obligation to call general meetings at which minority grievances
can be put forward. However, under CA 2006, s 303 et seq.(formerly CA 1985, s 368) members holding not less than one-tenth of such of the companyâ€™s paid-up capital as carries voting rights at the general meetings of the company can requisition a meeting. Thus, where a
company has 200,000 Â£1 A ordinary shares, 50p paid, and (say) 50,000 B ordinary shares of
Â£1 each, fully paid, and all the shares carry voting rights, the requisitionists must have paid up
on their shares, whether A or B ordinary, one-tenth of Â£150,000, i.e. Â£15,000. Where the company does not have a share capital, members of the company representing not less than onetenth of the total voting rights of all the members having a right to vote at general meetings
of the company may make a requisition. The required percentage becomes 5 per cent in the
case of a private company in which more than 12 months has elapsed since the end of the last
general meeting (s 303(3)).
The requisitionists must deposit at the companyâ€™s registered office a signed requisition
stating the objects for which they wish a meeting of the company to be held. The directors
must then convene a general meeting, and if they have not done so within 21 days after the
deposit of the requisition, the requisitionists, or any of them representing more than one-half
of their total voting rights, may themselves convene the meeting so long as they do so within
three months of the requisition. The requisitionists can recover reasonable expenses so

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
incurred from the company, and the company may in turn recover these from the fees of the
defaulting directors (see CA 2006, ss 304 and 305).
To ensure that the directors do not call the meeting for a date so far in the future as to
frustrate the minorityâ€™s aims the Act provides that the directors are deemed not to have duly
convened the meeting if they call it for a date more than 28 days after the notice convening it.
If they infringe this rule, the requisitionistsâ€™ power to call the meeting arises.
The companyâ€™s articles cannot deprive the members of the right to requisition a meeting
although they can provide that a smaller number of persons may requisition, e.g. one-twentieth.
An article would not be effective if it required a larger number than one-tenth.
It should be noted that CA 2006, s 303 uses the plural expression â€˜membersâ€™ throughout
so that the section basically requires two or more members holding the one-tenth share
or voting requirement. One member would not suffice even though he held the one-tenth
requirement. This requirement is presumably to ensure that there will be a quorum at the
requisitioned meeting.
CA 2006, s 306(2) allows one member to ask the court to call a meeting and says so but
there is no quorum problem here because the court when calling a meeting can fix the quorum
even at one if it wishes.
CA 2006, ss 303-305 provide the method by which members may demand a general meeting. Section 303 requires the directors to call a general meeting once the company has received
requests for companies with a share capital, from members representing at least 5 per cent of
such of the paid-up capital of the company as carries the right of voting at general meetings
of the company (excluding any paid-up capital held as treasury shares) and for companies
without a share capital, from members who represent at least 5 per cent of the total voting
rights of all the members having a right to vote at general meetings.
A member may request a general meeting in hard copy or electronic form pursuant to CA
2006, s 303(6)(a). However, the request must be authenticated under CA 2006, s 303(6)(b).
CA 2006, s 303(4)(a) necessitates that the request must state the general nature of the business to be dealt with at the meeting so, for example, the text of a resolution to be presented at
the meeting might be included in the general nature statement. CA 2006, s 304 requires the
directors to call a general meeting with 21 days of receiving a valid request under s 303 and
that the general meeting to be held on a date not more than 28 days after the date of the notice
of meeting. Under CA 2006, s 304(2), if the membersâ€™ request for a general meeting identifies
a resolution intended to be moved at the meeting, the notice of meeting must include notice
of this resolution.
CA 2006, s 305 (Power of members to call meeting at companyâ€™s expense) provides that
the members who requisitioned the meeting or any of them representing more than half
of the total voting rights of the requisitionists may themselves call the meeting where the
directors are required to call a meeting under s 303 but fail to do so within the requisite
time period set out in s 304. CA 2006, s 305(2) provides that where the membersâ€™ meeting
request identified a resolution intended to be moved at the meeting, the notice of meeting
must include notice of this resolution. CA 2006, s 305(3) provides that the meeting must
be called for a date not more than three months after the date on which the directors
became subject to the requirement to call a meeting. CA 2006, s 305(6) states that members
shall be reimbursed their reasonable expenses by the company with CA 2006, s 305(7) requiring that the directors who are in default in relation to calling the meeting having such
expenses deducted by the company from their directorsâ€™ fees or other remuneration due

Notice of meetings
Notice of meetings
Regulations relating to notice of meetings are usually laid down in the companyâ€™s articles and
these must be referred to, although there are certain statutory provisions with regard to notice
which must not be overlooked.
Length of notice
The companyâ€™s articles must be followed, but CA 2006, s 307 (formerly CA 1985, s 369) provides that any provision in the companyâ€™s articles is void if it provides for the calling of a
meeting of the company (other than an adjourned meeting) by a shorter notice than:
(a) in the case of the annual general meeting not less than 21 daysâ€™ notice in writing; and
(b) in the case of a meeting other than an annual general meeting, 14 daysâ€™ notice in writing.
Where the companyâ€™s articles do not make provision, the above periods apply. The Combined Code that applies to public limited companies but is an indicator of good practice in
all companies generally recommends 20 working days for annual general meeting notice
and papers.
Short notice
It should be noted that a meeting of a company, if called by a shorter period of notice
than that prescribed in the CA 2006 or by the companyâ€™s articles, shall be deemed validly
called if:
(a) in the case of the annual general meeting, all the members entitled to attend and vote there
at agree(CA 2006, s 337(2)); and
(b) in the case of any other meeting, it is agreed by a majority in number of the members
having a right to at tend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not
less than 95 per cent in nominal value of the shares giving a right to attend and vote at the
meeting; or in the case of a company not having a share capital, a majority representing
95 per cent of the total voting rights at the meeting (CA 2006, ss 307(5) and (6)).
Since in both (a) and (b) above all the members of the company with voting rights would
have to be in attendance the concession is in practice confined to meetings of private companies. Furthermore, it was held in Re Pearce Duff Co Ltd[1960] 3 All ER 222 that the mere
fact that all the members are present at the meeting and pass a particular resolution, either
unanimously or by a majority holding 95 per cent of the voting rights, does not imply consent to short notice and anyone who voted for a resolution in these circumstances can later
challenge it. In practice a document setting out the agreement of the members to short notice
should be signed by members at the meeting if all are present or, if not, consent can be given
by means of a number of documents sent out to members and returned by post. There would
appear to be no reason why this should not be done after a meeting called by inadequate
notice has taken place.
The days of notice must be â€˜clear daysâ€™, i.e. exclusive of the day of service and the day of
the meeting (CA 2006, s 360).

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
Persons to whom notice must be given
CA 2006, s 310 sets forth persons entitled to receive notice. Notice of a general meeting must
be sent to every member of the company and every director. Section 310 has effect subject to
any enactment or provisions of the companyâ€™s articles. For instance, Table A provides that
notice of general meetings shall be given to all the members, to all persons entitled to a share
in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member, and to the directors and auditors.
Notice of every general meeting must be given to the auditors, and if notice of a meeting is
not given to every person entitled to notice, the proceedings and any resolution passed at the
meeting will be invalid.
Youngv Ladies Imperial Club[1920] 2 KB 523
Mrs Young, who was a member of the club, was expelled by a resolution passed by the appropriate committee. The Duchess of Abercorn, who was a member of the committee, was not sent a
notice of the meeting, it being understood that she would not be able to attend. In fact, she had
previously informed the chairman that she would not be able to attend. Nevertheless, in this action
which was concerned with the validity of the expulsion, it was held - by the Court of Appeal - that
the failure to send a notice to the Duchess invalidated the proceedings of the committee and
rendered the expulsion void. Per Scrutton LJ:
Every member of the committee ought, in my view, to be summoned to every meeting of the committee except in a case where summoning can have no possible result, as where the member is at
such a distance that the summons cannot effectively reach the member in time to allow him or her to
communicate with the committee. Extreme illness may be another ground, though I should myself
require the illness to be extremely serious, because a member of the committee receiving a notice to
attend may either write to ask for an adjournment of the meeting or express his views in writing to the
committee, and I should require the illness to be such as to prevent that form of action being taken
on receiving notice of such a meeting.
However, under CA 2006, s 313the accidental omission to give notice of a meeting, or the
non-receipt of notice of a m eeting by any person entitled to receive notice, does not invalidate
the proceedings at that meeting and any resolutions passed.
Re West Canadian Collieries Ltd[1962] Ch 370
The company failed to give notice of a meeting to certain of its members because their plates were
inadvertently left out of an addressograph machine which was being used to prepare the
envelopes in which the notices were sent. The proceedings of the meeting were not invalidated, it
being held in the High Court to be an accidental omission within an article of the company similar
to Table A.
Musselwhitev C H Musselwhite & Sons Ltd[1962] Ch 964
The company failed to give notice of a general meeting to certain persons who had sold their
shares but had not been paid and remained on the register of members. The directors believed
that the mere fact of entering into a contract of sale had made them cease to be members.

Notice of meetings
Held - in the High Court - the proceedings of the general meeting were invalidated since the
error was one of law and not an accidental omission within an article of the company similar to
In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles, preference shareholders without the power to vote have no right to be summoned to general meetings (Re Mackenzie &
Co Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 450). Where the company has share warrants, some arrangements will
have to be made to advertise the meeting if the holders of the warrants have any right to
attend under the articles.
CA 2006, s 307 sets out, as we have seen, certain minimum periods of notice for general
meetings. This makes it impossible and therefore unnecessary to send notice to persons
becoming members after the notice is sent out. Such persons, do, however, have the right to
attend and vote at the meeting or appoint a proxy and if this causes difficulty legal advice
should be sought on the drafting of an article which states expressly that notice need not be
sent to such persons and also that they cannot attend and vote at the meeting.
Method of service
CA 2006, s 308 designates how notice of a general meeting of a company must be given. CA
2006, s 309 indicates when a website notice is appropriate. Table A provides for service of
notice and this sort of procedure is generally followed. These provisions are as follows:
(i) A notice may be given by the company to any member or his representative either personally or by sending it by post to his registered address.
(ii) A notice may be given to joint holders by giving notice to the first joint holder named in
the register of members.
The minimum number of days which must intervene between the day of posting the notice
and the day of the meeting is not affected by the length of time which it takes for the Post
Office to deliver the notice. The articles must, of course, be looked at but under Reg 115 of
Table A service of a notice of meeting is deemed to have been effected 48 hours after posting.
Thus under Table A an annual general meeting due to be held on 25 March would be validly
convened by notices sent on 1 March whether by first or second class mail. It will be recalled
that days of notice must be â€˜clear daysâ€™.
However, such a provision will not always be applied. In Bradman v Trinity Estates plc
[1989] BCLC 757, the High Court refused to accept deemed delivery of notices posted to
shareholders outside London during a postal dispute. Those who attended the meeting were
members with London addresses who received their notices by courier. Mr Bradman, a shareholder, asked for and obtained an injunction to prevent the company from acting on a resolution passed at the meeting.
If the letter containing the notice has clearly not been delivered, as where it is returned to
the company, notice would under Table A, Reg 115 still be regarded as having been given.
Evidence of proper posting is, under that regulation, â€˜conclusiveâ€™ evidence that notice was
given and this cannot be rebutted as is the case with all evidence which is regarded as conclusive. Other articles may not carry a provision regarding the conclusive nature of receipt of
notice and evidence of non-delivery would prevent the deeming provisions from applying.
These points were decided in Re Thundercrest(1994) The Times, 2 August.

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
Contents of notice
CA 2006, s 311 sets forth the contents of notices of a general meeting. The notice of a general
meeting must state the time and date of the meeting and the place of the meeting. Notice of
a general meeting of a company must state the general nature of the business to be dealt with
at the meeting. The articles generally specify what the notice must contain, but Table A provides
that it must specify the time and place of the meeting, and the general nature of the business
to be transacted.
If the meeting is the annual general meeting of a public company, the notice must under
CA 2006, s 337 say so. If it is convened to pass a special resolution, it must say so and the
resolution(s) must be set out verbatim (McConnell v Prill[1916] 2 Ch 57), as must ordinary
resolutions of which special notice is required and resolutions put on the agenda of the annual general meeting by shareholders (see below) (see CA 2006, s 339). In addition, the notice
must be adequate to enable members to judge whether they should attend the meeting to
protect their interests. Thus in McConnell v Prill[1916] 2 Ch 57 a notice of a meeting called
to increase the nominal capital of the company did not say by how much. It was held that
the notice was invalid because the eventual issue of the new shares (and there were no preemption rights then) could affect the rights of existing shareholders and they were therefore
entitled to know by how much the nominal capital was to be increased.
Under CA 2006, s 325 the notice must clearly state the right of a member to appoint a proxy.
Notice of membersâ€™ resolutions at the Annual General Meeting
Members representing not less than one-twentieth of the total voting rights of all the members, or 100 or more members holding shares in the company on which there has been paid
up an average sum of not less than Â£100 per member, can, under CA 2006, s 314, by making
a written requisition to the company, compel the company:
(a) to give to members who are entitled to receive notice of the next annual general meeting,
notice of any resolution which may be properly moved and which they intend to move at
that meeting; and
(b) to circulate to members who are entitled to have notice of any general meeting sent to
them, any statement of not more than 1,000 words with respect to the matter referred to
in any proposed resolution or the business to be dealt with at the meeting.
The amount which has been paid up on the shares is not material so, assuming that a company has 300,000 Â£1 ordinary shares 50p paid and 100,000 Â£1 preference shares fully paid all
with voting rights, then the requisition could be made by the holders of 80,000 shares. If made
by 100 requisitionists, then the amount paid up on their shares if added together would have
to come to at least Â£10,000.
The requisition must be made and deposited in accord with CA 2006, s 314(4) governing
procedures for circulation of resolutions for annual general meetings.
Under s 316(1) of the CA 2006, the expenses of the company do not need to be paid by
the members who requested the circulation of the statement if (a) the meeting to which
the requests relate is an annual general meeting of a public company; and (b) requests
are sufficient to require the company to circulate the statement received before the end of
the financial year preceding the meeting. Section 316(2) goes on to state that otherwise the
expenses of the company must be paid by the members who requested the circulation of the

Procedure at meetings - legal aspects
statement unless the company resolves otherwise, and unless the company has previously so
resolved, it is not bound to comply with that section unless there is deposited with or tendered
to it, not later than one week before the meeting, a sum reasonably sufficient to meet its
expenses in doing so.
The company is not bound by the above provisions if, on application to the court by the
company or any person affected, the court is satisfied that they are being abused in order to
secure needless publicity for defamatory or abusive behaviour (CA 2006, s 317). The above
procedures are confined to resolutions to be proposed at the annual general meetings.
Special notice
An ordinary resolution of which special notice has been given is required in the following cases:
(a) under CA 2006, s 168, to remove a director before the expiration of his period of office,
regardless of any provision in the articles or in any agreement with him. If it is intended
to replace the director if he is removed, special notice must be given of that also. The
section does not prevent companies from attaching special voting rights to certain shares
âž¨ See p. 115 on this occasion (Bushell v Faith, 1969, see Chapter 5 âž¨); or
(b) removing an auditor before the expiration of his term of office (CA 2006, s 511).
Under CA 2006, s 312, where special notice is required, the resolution is not effective unless
notice of the intention to move it has been given to the company not less than 28 days before
the meeting at which it is to be moved. The notice should be posted or delivered to the registered office of the company. The company must give its members notice of any such resolution at the same time and in the same manner as it gives notice of the meeting or, if this is not
possible, must give them notice of it either by advertisement in a newspaper having an appropriate circulation or by any other method allowed by the articles, not less than 14days before the
meeting. If a meeting is called for a date 28 days or less after the notice has been given, the notice,
though not given in time under the section, shall be deemed to have been properly given.
The above provision is designed to protect shareholders who give notice, e.g. to remove
a director or auditor, in case the board calls the meeting of members deliberately at less than
28 days so as to frustrate the removal of the director or auditor.
Procedure at meetings - legal aspects
A consideration of the legal, as distinct from the company secretarial, aspects of procedure
once the meeting has been convened involves a discussion of the matter of quorum, voting,
proxies, the position of the chairman and the recording of minutes.
Quorum: generally
The concept of quorum relates to the minimum number of persons suitably qualified who
must be present at a meeting in order that business may be validly transacted.
If the articles do not lay down the quorum required for general meetings, CA 2006, s 318
provides that in the case of both public and private companies two members personally
present shall be a quorum.

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
Therefore, as a general rule and in the absence of a provision in the articles at least two
members present in person are required to constitute a meeting. The position in regard to
single-member companies has already been considered in Chapter 1 but the quorum there is
one member present in person or by proxy.
Sharpv Dawes(1876) 2 QBD 26
The Great Caradon Mine was run by a mining company in Cornwall and was carried on on the
cost-book system, being controlled by the Stannaries Act 1869. The company had offices in
London, and on 22 December 1874 notice of a general meeting was properly given. The meeting
was held, but only the secretary, Sharp, and one shareholder, a Mr Silversides who held 25 shares,
attended. Nevertheless, the business of the meeting was conducted with Silversides in the chair.
Among other things, a call on shares was made and the defendant refused to pay it. He was sued
by the secretary, Sharp, who brought the action on behalf of the company, and his defence was
that calls had to be made at a meeting and there had been no meeting on this occasion.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - the call was invalid. According to the ordinary use of the English
language, a meeting could not be constituted by one shareholder.
In Re London Flats Ltd[1969] 2 All ER 744
The company was in liquidation and a meeting was called under what is now the Insolvency Act
1986 to appoint a successor to the liquidator who had died. At the meeting X, one of the only two
shareholders, proposed that he be appointed liquidator and put forward an amendment to the resolution before the meeting which substituted his own name in the resolution for the person named
therein who was a chartered accountant. The other shareholder, Y, left the meeting saying, â€˜I withdraw from the meeting, you now have no quorum.â€™ The meeting continued and the amended
resolution was put to the vote. There being one vote in favour and none against, X as chairman
declared the amendment carried, thus making himself liquidator. Y made application to the court
for the removal of X and the appointment of a liquidator by the court on the ground that the
appointment of X was invalid, the meeting having consisted of only one shareholder.
Held - by Plowman J - that the appointment of X was invalid. The matter was then referred to
chambers for the appointment of an independent liquidator. An accountant unconnected with the
parties was appointed.
CA 2006, s 318 calculates the quorum by reference to the numbers of â€˜qualifying personsâ€™
who are present at the meeting. This term includes an individual who is a member of the company; a person authorised under section 323 to act as the representative of a corporation; and
a person appointed as proxy of a member. CA 2006 establishes that proxies and corporate
representatives will usually count as part of a quorum. In the case of single-member companies, one qualifying person present at a meeting is a quorum. In any other case, subject to
the provisions of the companyâ€™s articles, two qualifying persons present at a meeting are a
quorum, unless: they are both a qualifying person as the representative of a corporation, and
they are representatives of the same corporation; or they are both a qualifying person as
proxy of a member, and they are proxies of the same member.
CA 2006, s 334 provides that the necessary quorum for a variation of class rights meeting
is, for a meeting (other than an adjourned meeting), two persons present holding at least

Procedure at meetings - legal aspects
one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class in question (excluding any shares
of that class held as treasury shares) and, for an adjourned meeting, one person present, holding shares of the class in question. Where a person is present by proxy or proxies, she is treated
as holding only the shares in respect of which those proxies are authorised to exercise voting
rights. CA 2006, s 334 confirms the position regarding proxies in that they apply equally to
class meetings as they would to general meetings.
Regulation 30 of the Model Articles of Association for Public Companies states, and
Regulation 38 of the Model Articles of Association for Private Companies states, that no
business other than the appointment of the chairman of the meeting is to be transacted at
a general meeting if the persons attending it do not constitute a quorum (Companies (Model
Articles) Regulations 2008). In Table A, Reg 40 sets the number of persons required to satisfy
a quorum for Table Acompanies.
Quorum of one
Where an annual general meeting or other general meeting is called by the court, the court,
as the case may be, may decide upon the quorum which may even be one member present in
person or by proxy.
Re EI Sombrero Ltd[1958] 3 All ER 1
The applicant in this case held 90 per cent of the shares of the company which was a private company. The companyâ€™s two directors held 5 per cent of the shares each. The companyâ€™s articles provided that the quorum for general meetings was two persons present in person or by proxy, and if
within half an hour from the time appointed for holding a meeting a quorum was not present, the
meeting, if convened on the requisition of the members, was deemed dissolved. On 11 March 1958,
the applicant requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to pass a resolution removing the two
directors and appointing others in their place. The directors did not comply with the requisition, so
the applicant himself convened an extraordinary general meeting for 21 April 1958. The two directors deliberately failed to attend, and since no quorum was present, the meeting was dissolved.
The applicant took out a summons asking for a meeting to be called by the court to pass a resolution removing the two directors, and for a direction that one member of the company should be
deemed to constitute a quorum at such meeting. The application was opposed by the directors.
Held - by the High Court - since in practice a meeting of the company could not be convened
under the articles, the court had a jurisdiction to order a meeting to be held, and for one member
to constitute a quorum, and such an order was made. The applicant was entitled to enforce his
statutory right to remove the directors by ordinary resolution, and the directors had refused to perform their statutory duty to call a meeting for the sole reason that, if a meeting was held, they would
cease to be directors.
This case was followed in Re HR Paul & Son Ltd (1973) The Times, 17 November, where
Brightman J ordered a general meeting to take place with a quorum of one where a 90 per cent
shareholder could not get alterations in the articles because the minority had refused to attend
general meetings. In cases such as this it is often impossible for the major shareholder to transfer
a few shares to a nominee in order to make a quorum, either because there are pre-emption provisions in the articles or the remaining members are also directors who have a majority on the
board and refuse to register the necessary transfers.

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
CA 2006, ss 334 and 335 are concerned with the matter of quorum at class meetings, fixing
it at two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the
issued share capital of the class in question. At an adjourned class meeting the required quorum is one person holding shares of the class in question or his proxy. In addition, in East v
Bennet Bros Ltd[1911] 1 Ch 163 it was held by Warrington J that one member who held all
the shares of a class constituted a valid class meeting.
The position in single-member private companies has already been considered.
Quorum of one: committees of directors
Table A, Reg 72 authorises delegation by the board to one director acting as a committee of
the board. The court accepted in Re Taurine Co(1883) 25 Ch D 118 that under a similar provision in articles a director meeting alone constituted a valid meeting of the committee.
Effect of no quorum
Unless there is a quorum present, the meeting is null and void, but the articles must be looked at
in order to ascertain whether a quorum is required throughout the meeting or only at the beginning. For instance, Table Aprovides that a quorum is required throughout the meeting but if
the articles are silent on this particular point the better view is that a quorum need only be present at the beginning and need not be present throughout, though no valid resolutions can be
passed if the number of persons present falls to one (In Re London Flats Ltd, 1969, but see above).
Table A provides that if within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting a
quorum is not present, the meeting shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week
at the same time and place, or to such other day and at such time and place as the directors
may determine. The same provision applies if there ceases to be a quorum during the course
of the meeting. There must be a quorum of two at the adjourned meeting or it is similarly adjourned until there is. Ultimately, application to the court would be necessary.
The chairman
It is his duty to preserve order, to call on members to speak, to decide points of order, such
as the acceptability of amendments, and to take the vote after a proper discussion in order to
ascertain the sense of the meeting. However, he is not bound to hear everyone. He must be
fair to the minority but as Lindley MR said in Wall v London Northern & Assets Corporation
[1898] 2 Ch 469, the majority can say: â€˜We have heard enough. We are not bound to listen until
everybody is tired of talking and has sat down.â€™ Under CA 2006, s 319 the members present at
the meeting may elect one of their number as chairman unless the articles otherwise provide.
Table Aprovides that the chairman (if any) of the board of directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the company, or if there is no such chairman, or if he is not
present within 15 minutes after the time appointed for the holding of the meeting, or if he will
not act, the directors present shall elect one of their number to be chairman of the meeting,
and if there is only one director present and willing to act he shall be chairman.
If no director is present, or no director present is willing to act within 15 minutes after the
time appointed for holding the meeting, the members present must choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

Unless the articles provide to the contrary, voting is by show of hands only. Articles usually
allow an initial vote by show of hands, particularly for routine matters, and each member has
only one vote, regardless of his shareholding. Under CA 2006, s 324 there cannot be any voting in respect of proxies held, unless the articles provide. On controversial issues it is usual to
demand a poll on which members can vote according to the number of shares they hold and
proxy votes can be used. Table A allows a poll to be demanded before a vote on a show of
hands is taken. The provisions of Table A state that in the case of joint holders the person
whose name appears first in the register of members shall be allowed to cast the vote in respect
of the shares, and no member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting unless all moneys
presently payable by him in respect of the shares have been paid. Table A also provides
that objections to the qualification of a voter can only be raised at the meeting at which the
vote is tendered. Objections are to be referred to the chairman of the meeting whose decision
is final and conclusive.
It should also be noted that a shareholder, even if he is a director, can vote on a matter in
which he has a personal interest subject to the rules relating to prejudice of minorities (see
âž¨ See p. 312 Chapter 16 âž¨). Furthermore, a bankrupt shareholder may vote and give proxies if his name
is still on the register, though he must do so in accordance with the wishes of the trustee
(Morgan v Gray[1953] Ch 83).
If no poll is demanded, the vote on the show of hands as declared by the chairman and
recorded in the minutes is the decision of the meeting and under Table A his declaration is
conclusive, without proof of the number of votes cast for or against the resolution, unless there
is an obvious error, as where the chairman states: â€˜There being a majority of 51 per cent on
the show of hands, I hereby declare that the special resolution to alter the articles has been
passed.â€™ The chairmanâ€™s declaration would not be conclusive either if he had improperly
refused a poll.
The articles may set out the provisions governing the demand for a poll, but CA 2006, s 321
lays down that such prov isions in the companyâ€™s articles shall be voidin certain circumstances:
(a) They must not exclude the right to demand a poll at a general meeting on any question
other than the election of the chairman or the adjournment of the meeting.
(b) They must not try to stifle a demand for a poll if it is made by:
(i) not less than five members having the right to vote at the meeting; or
(ii) a member or members representing not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights
of all the members having the right to vote at the meeting; or
(iii) a member or members holding shares in the company which confer a right to vote
at the meeting and on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less
than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all such shares. For example, if the share
capital of the company was 10,000 shares of Â£1 each with 50p per share paid, the
company would have received Â£5,000 from the shareholders and those wishing to
demand a poll under this head would have had together to have paid up Â£500.
Thus, the articles cannot prevent a fairly sizeable group of members from demanding
a poll, and under CA 2006, s 329 the holder of a proxy can join in demanding a poll. As such,
a proxy for five members could in effect demand a poll on his own. The right of a proxy to
demand a poll (CA 1985, s 373(2)) is restated at CA 2006, s 329. CA 2006, s 322 has now

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
replaced CA 1985, s 374. A proxy will be entitled to vote on a show of hands as well as on
a poll (CA 2006, s 324(1)). The current version of Reg 54 of Table A provides that every
member present by proxy has a vote on a show of hands. Versions of Table Ain force prior
to 1 October 2007 only provided for a member present in person to be able to vote on a show
of hands (and not a proxy).
Table A provides that the chairman can demand a poll, and indeed it would be his duty to
do this if he felt it necessary to ascertain the sense of the meeting. It also ensures that the board
can exercise its full voting rights. Table A also provides that two members present in person
or by proxy can demand a poll, and no provision in the special articles can increase this
number beyond five, as we have already seen.
Taking the poll
A poll, if demanded, is usually taken straight away, the result being announced at the end of
the meeting, but the articles may allow the poll to be taken at a later date. Table A provides
that on any issue, other than the election of a chairman or on the adjournment of the meeting, a poll may be taken at such time not being more than 30 days after the poll is demanded,
as is directed by the chairman who then proceeds to the next business.
Persons not actually present at the first meeting may vote on the subsequent poll. Under
Table A in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it is demanded, the proxies must
be deposited after the poll has been demanded and not less than 24 hours before the time
appointed for the taking of the poll. Where the poll is not taken forthwith but is taken not
more than 48 hours after it was demanded, proxies must be delivered at the meeting at which
the poll was demanded to the chairman or to the secretary or to any director and an instrument of proxy which is not deposited or delivered in a manner so permitted is invalid.
Even where a poll is taken immediately, the result may not be declared until a future date,
because of the problems involved in checking the votes and the right of the members to cast
them. Postal votes are not acceptable. Under CA 2006, s 322, where a proxy holder is acting
for several principals, he need not use all the votes in the same way on a poll. This enables him
to vote in the way each principal directs. Section 322A provides that a companyâ€™s articles can
provide for votes to be cast in advance of a meeting.
Chapter 5 of Part 13 of CA 2006 sets out new requirements for quoted companies if a poll
is taken (quoted company is defined in CA 2006, s 385 which applies to Part 13 as a result of
CA 2006, s 361). CA 2006, s 341 mandated a quoted company to disclose on a website the
result of any poll taken at a general meeting. A quoted company must, as a minimum, disclose the following: the date of the meeting; the text of the resolution or a description of the
subject matter of the poll; the number of votes cast in favour; and the number of votes cast
against. Non-compliance does not invalidate the poll but is an offence punishable by fine.
CA 2006, s 342 allows members of a quoted company to require the directors to obtain an
independent report of any poll taken, or to be taken, at a general meeting of the company.
The report may be demanded by members holding not less than 5 per cent of the voting rights
or by not less than 100 members who hold shares in the company on which there has been
paid-up an average sum per member of not less than Â£100. The request must be received by
the company not less than one week after the poll was taken.
If an independent report is requested, the directors must appoint an independent assessor
pursuant to CA 2006, s 343. Such appointment must be made within one week of the request
for a report. The assessor must be independent in accordance with CA 2006, s 344. He must

not be an officer or employee (or partner or employee of such person, or a partnership of
which such person is a partner) of the company or any associated undertaking of the company and there must not be some other connection (of any description as may be specified
by regulations made by the Secretary of State) between the person or his associate and the
company or associated undertaking of the company. The companyâ€™s auditor is considered to
be independent. A person also cannot act if he has another role on any poll on which he is
to report.
The independent assessor is entitled to attend the meeting at which the poll may be taken
and any subsequent proceedings in connection with the poll pursuant to CA 2006, s 348.
He may access the companyâ€™s records relating to any poll on which he is to report or the meeting at which the poll or polls may be, or were, taken pursuant to CA 2006, s 349. CA 2006,
s 351 provides that the independent assessorâ€™s identity, a description of the subject matter
of the poll to which his appointment relates and a copy of his report must be made available
on a website that is maintained by or on behalf of the company in question or which identifies
the company in question. The minimum information the independent report must contain is
set forth in CA 2006, s 347. The report must give the assessorâ€™s reasons for the opinions stated
and, if he is unable to form an opinion on any of the matters, record that fact and state the
CA 2006, s 341 requires quoted companies to disclose poll results on their websites.
Chairmanâ€™s casting vote
Chairmen of companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2007 (excluding traded companies)
and if permitted by the articles, have a casting vote. For traded companies incorporated at any
time and non-traded companies incorporated after 1 October 2007, the articles may no longer
give the chairman a casting vote as CA 2006, s 282 requires an ordinary resolution to be passed
by a simple majority. For non-traded companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2007, the
CA 2006 provides that if the articles gave the chairman a casting vote such provision would
continue to have effect notwithstanding CA 2006, ss 281(3) and 282.
The chairman is not bound to exercise his casting vote and may declare that the resolution
has not been passed or exercise the casting vote for or against it. He ought normally to vote
against it so that it is clearly lost because since those who want the resolution passed and those
who want it to fail are equal in number it would not be fair to pass the resolution in the face
of such opposition. The most common use of a casting vote is by a chairman on a show of
hands, in favour of the resolution, where he knows that there are a lot of proxies in favour of
the resolution.
The right to appoint proxies is governed by CA 2006, ss 284, 285 and 324-331. It must be
noted that the Government issued a Ministerial Statement on 6 November 2008 indicating
that it will propose to repeal CA 2006, ss 327(2)(c) and 330(6)(c) of the CA 2006 which were
not commenced with the rest of Part 13. CA 2006, s 324(1) gives members the right to appoint
a proxy to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. This section, of course, countermands
any provision to the contrary that may be contained in a companyâ€™s articles. Under CA 2006,

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
s 324 et seqevery member of a company having a share capital and entitled to vote at a meeting may appoint a proxy, and the person appointed need not be a member of the company.
However, the proxy should have full legal capacity and the appointment of a minor is probably void; certainly the Insolvency Rules 1986 (SI 1986/1925) exclude minors as proxies in
meetings concerned with winding-up (see Rule 8.1(3)). In addition, the notice of the meeting
must make it clear that proxies can be appointed and failure to do will result in a fine on every
officer of the company in default but even so the meeting is valid (CA 2006, s 325).
CA 2006, s 324(2) allows members to appoint multiple proxies provided that that a proxy
must be appointed in relation to at least one share or different Â£10, or multiple of Â£10, of
stock. This is a baseline standard, however, and articles are free to provide for additional
rights. Accordingly if a member holds two ordinary shares, he will only be permitted by
s 324(2) to appoint one or two proxies but the companyâ€™s articles could permit the member
to appoint more than two proxies. In public companies a member may appoint two or more
proxies, but in a private company only one unless the articles provide to the contrary. Table
A allows two or more in both public and private companies. Under CA 2006, s 327, companies may set a cut-off point by which time a member must have lodged his proxy appointment in order for it to be valid. It also provides that any provision of the companyâ€™s articles
which requires any appointment of a proxy to be received by the company more than 48
hours before the time of the meeting is void. In CA 2006, s 327(2) different cut-off periods for
proxy appointments where a poll is taken are provided. Finally, CA 2006, s 327(3) provides
that in calculating the periods pursuant to subsection (2) of CA 2006, s 327 â€˜no account shall
be taken of any part of a day that is not a working dayâ€™.
The expression â€˜proxyâ€™ also refers to the document by which the voting agent is appointed.
The articles frequently set out the form of a proxy but a written appointment in reasonable
form will suffice (Isaacs v Chapman(1916) 32 TLR 237). Furthermore, minor errors which
do not seriously mislead will not make a proxy invalid. Thus in Oliver v Dalgleish[1963] 3 All
ER 330 a proxy form gave the correct date of the meeting but said it was the annual general
meeting and not an extraordinary general meeting as it in fact was. It was held by the High
Court that the proxy was nevertheless valid.
Table Aand the Model Articles (Reg 45(3)) provides for two-way proxies, as distinct from
appointing a person to exercise the vote, under which a member can indicate whether he
wishes to vote for or against a particular resolution. The articles of association must not
forbid two-way proxies if the Stock Exchange is to give a listing or the shares are to be dealt in
on the AIM. It is uncertain whether the company is bound by a two-way proxy as regards the
choice of vote but the better view is that it is bound so that if a proxy tried to cast his votes
differently from the way in which the member had indicated the company ought not to accept
the change (Oliver vDalgleish[1963] 3 All ER 330).
Listed companies now use three-way which provides for an option to abstain from voting.
Additionally, some listed companies provide for four-way voting which allow the proxy discretion to decide whether and how to vote (or withhold their vote). In the absence of such an
option, the proxy retains such discretion if no specific voting instruction has been given by
the member.
Following on from the discussion above on polling, CA 1985 provided that proxies had the
right to vote on a poll but there was no automatic right to vote on a show of hands. Now CA
2006, s 285(1) provides that on a vote on a resolution on a show of hands at a meeting, every
proxy present who has been duly appointed by one or more members entitled to vote on the
resolution has one vote. However, subsection (2) provides an exception in that a proxy has

one vote for and one vote against the resolution if he has been duly appointed by more than
one member entitled to vote on the resolution; and instructed by one or more of those members to vote for the resolution and by one or more other of those members to vote against it.
The fallback provision provided for in CA 2006, s 285(5) is that the articles can override the
position set forth in subsections (1) and (2).
CA 2006, s 326 requires that where the company offers that a particular person (or persons), such as the chairman of the meeting, will act as a proxy (or proxies), that offer must be
made to all members. CA 2006, s 328 allows that a proxy may be elected to be the chairman
of a general meeting by resolution of the company passed at a meeting so long as this is not
contrary to any existing provision in the companyâ€™s articles.
CA 2006, s 331 authorises a companyâ€™s articles to give more extensive rights regarding
proxies than the minimum set out in the CA 2006, ss 324 to 330 (proxies).
The board may circulate proxy forms in favour of the board to members and meet the
expense from the companyâ€™s funds (Peel v L & NW Railway[1907] 1 Ch 5). However, these
forms must be sent to all members entitled to attend and vote. This provision prevents the
directors merely soliciting the votes of those who are likely to vote in favour of the boardâ€™s
proposals. In addition, the directors may also send circulars with the notice of the meeting
putting forward their views on various resolutions and pay for the circularisation out of the
companyâ€™s funds (Peel v L & NW Railway [1907] 1 Ch 5). However, the circular must be
issued in good faith to inform the members of the issues involved and must not be unduly
biased in favour of the directorsâ€™ views.
The right to appoint a proxy would be useless if it had to be made many weeks before
the meeting. So, whatever the articles may provide, a proxy is valid if lodged not later than
48 hours before the meeting. If the articles do have an earlier requirement, it is void and it
appears that the company cannot then require any period of lodgement at all so that if the
proxy turns up at the meeting with his form and votes his vote must be accepted.
The law relating to faxed proxies is unclear. The court may not regard a fax as â€˜executedâ€™
(signed) by the member as Table A, Reg 60 requires, and perhaps also as not â€˜deposited with
the companyâ€™ as Reg 62 requires. Also the proxy remains with the member and the company
does not get â€˜depositâ€™ of it but only a â€˜copyâ€™ of it (but see PNC Telecom plc vThomas[2003]
BCC 202 that seems to support the view that a fax will be â€˜depositedâ€™ as the law requires).
However, in the last analysis it is up to the chairman of the meeting to decide whether or not
to accept a proxy, and he would be wise to accept a faxed proxy rather than risk a challenge
in the courts as to the validity of the meeting brought by the shareholder whose faxed proxy
was rejected.
It is worth noting that the acceptance of a faxed proxy is reinforced by the decision of the
High Court in Re a Debtor (No 2021 of 1995), ex parte IRC v Debtor [1996] 2 All ER 345
where Laddie J held that a faxed proxy form was signed for the purposes of a creditorsâ€™ meeting in a proposed voluntary arrangement and under Rule 8.2(3) of the Insolvency Rules of
1986 if it bore upon it some distinctive or personal marking which had been placed there by
or with the authority of the creditor. When a creditor faxed a proxy form to the chairman of
a creditorsâ€™ meeting he transmitted the contents of the form and the signature applied to it.
The receiving fax was instructed by the transmitting creditor to reproduce his signature on
the proxy form which was itself being created at the receiving station. It followed that the
received fax was a proxy form signed by the principal. The judge did, however, make clear that
his decision was on the Insolvency Rules and that different considerations may apply to
faxed documents in relation to other legislation. To avoid any doubt, special articles could be

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
drafted so as to specifically allow faxed proxy forms to be accepted. Obviously, faxed proxies
are acceptable where the company has set up electronic communication systems with the
consent of the relevant member(s).
The Model Articles for both private companies limited by shares and public companies
each contain just two articles relating to proxies (Articles 31 and 32 in the case of the Model
Articles for private companies and Articles 45 and 46 in the case of the model articles for public
companies). These articles cover the content of proxy notices as well the delivery of proxy
notices. The Model Articles require certain information to be included in proxy forms and
permit the company to require use of a particular form instead of indicating precise wording.
However, it must be noted that many matters concerning proxies are to be found in the CA
2006 as opposed to the Model Articles.
Electronic communications
These are governed by CA 2006, ss 308, 309, 333 and 1143 to 1148 and Schedules 4 and 5
to the CA 2006. Moreover, CA 2006, ss 1144(2) and (3), requires that documents or information sent or supplied by a company (including notices) must be sent or supplied in accordance with Schedule 5. CA 2006, s 333(1) provides that where a company has given an
electronic address in a notice of general meeting it is deemed to have agreed that any document or information relating to proceedings at the meeting (this appears to cover proxy forms)
may be sent by electronic means to that address subject to any conditions or limitations
specified in the notice. Additionally, CA 2006, s 333 also contains similar deemed acceptance
provisions specifically relating to proxy forms.
CA 2006, s 309 provides for publication of notices of meeting on website. In these circumstances, where a member has agreed, or is deemed to have agreed, to website publication of
documents, the notice of meeting does not have to be sent to that person in hard copy but the
member must be notified of the presence of the notice on the companyâ€™s website. Notification
by hard-copy (always good) or by electronic communications (such as by e-mail) when the
member has specifically agreed to accept this type of communication will suffice.
CA 2006, s 333A requires an electronic address to be provided for receipt of â€˜any document
or information relating to proxies for a general meetingâ€™. CA 2006, s 333A(4) states that documents relating to proxies include a proxy appointment, any document necessary to show the
validity of, or otherwise relating to, the appointment of a proxy including a copy of a power
of attorney showing authority to appoint a proxy on behalf of the member and notice of the
termination of the authority of a proxy. Under s 333A, â€˜electronic addressâ€™ has the meaning
given by s 333(4) of the CA 2006: any address or number used for the purposes of sending or
receiving documents or information by electronic means.
Euroclear UK (formerly known as CRESTCo) provides a system enabling registered holders
of securities in CREST to appoint and instruct a proxy by electronic means through the
CREST system. CREST is the UKâ€™s real-time electronic settlement system for UK and international shares, and UK government bonds (Gilts). Allowing proxy appointments to be made
through CREST constitutes an electronic appointment. Typically a service offering members
the ability to appoint and terminate a proxy electronically will be provided by the companyâ€™s
registrars. Section 333A does not require electronic appointment to be available to all members.
CA 2006, s 324A mandates that a proxy must vote in accordance with any instructions
given by the member by whom the proxy is appointed. As regards revocation of a proxy, since
the proxy is merely an agent of the member this can be done expressly by telling the proxy not

Adjournment of the meeting
to vote or by the member exercising his right to vote in person, in which case his personal vote
will override that of the proxy if the latter votes (Cousins v International Brick Co Ltd[1931]
2 Ch 90). No statutory provision to the contrary exists in CA 2006. There is also automatic
revocation of a proxy if the member who made the appointment dies or becomes bankrupt
or of unsound mind. It should be noted that revocation is impossible if the proxy has an interest. Thus where L lends money to B and takes Bâ€™s share certificates in X Ltd as security but is
not registered it may be part of the agreement that L should always be appointed Bâ€™s proxy at
meetings of X Ltd. If so, the appointment of L as proxy is irrevocable until the loan is repaid.
All that is said in the above paragraph is subject to the articles of the company concerned
(Spiller v Mayo (Rhodesia) Development Co (1908) Ltd[1926] WN 78). Table A provides that
a vote given or poll demanded by a proxy or by the duly authorised representative of a corporation shall be valid notwithstanding the previous determination of the authority of the
person voting or demanding a poll unless notice of the determination was received by the
company at the office or at such other place at which the instrument of proxy was duly
deposited before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote
is given or the poll demanded or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on the same day
as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for taking the poll. Thus, under
Table Athe acts and votes of a proxy are valid unless the company knows of any revocation.
Corporate representatives
Where a company is a member of another company, the member company is entitled under
CA 2006, s 323 to appoint by resolution of its directors a representative to attend meetings.
If the member company is in liquidation, the liquidator may also make the appointment
(Hillmanv Crystal Bowl Amusements[1973] 1 All ER 379). The representative is not a proxy
and has the full rights of a member; thus he always counts towards the quorum, can move
resolutions and amendments, can speak, even if the company is a public one, and can always
vote on a show of hands. It is of some advantage to a company to appoint a representative,
though if the meeting is not controversial a proxy will do just as well. CA 2006, s 323 provides
that a corporate representative is entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder.
A corporate representative is entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder (CA 2006,
s 323(2)). If the corporation authorises more than one person, this same section sets for the law
to be followed with respect to such representative in the case of a show of hands or on a poll.
Adjournment of the meeting
A meeting may be adjourned for various reasons, e.g. where the business cannot be completed
on that day, or where there is no quorum. The adjourned meeting is deemed to be a resumption of the original meeting and the articles may provide as to the amount of notice required
for it, but no business may be transacted at an adjourned meeting except that which was left
unfinished at the original meeting.
Where a resolution is passed at an adjourned meeting of the company, or at a class meeting or a meeting of the directors, the resolution shall be deemed for all purposes to have been

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
passed on the date when it was in fact passed and not at the date of the earlier meeting. The
section is thus important in deciding on what date to file a resolution which has to be filed
within so many days of its being passed.
The articles usually determine who shall decide to adjourn, whether the members or the
chairman. A chairman must not adjourn frivolously, and if he does so the members may elect
a new chairman and proceed with the meeting. Table A provides that the chairman may (and
shall if so directed by the meeting), with the consent of the meeting, adjourn the meeting from
time to time and from place to place. Model Articles 41(5) (private companies) and 33(5)
(public companies) also cover adjournment.
The chairman can, of course, adjourn under the common law without any resolution of
the members where there is disorder at the meeting. However, he must exercise the power
properly. Thus, if he adjourns the meeting immediately upon the outbreak of disorder without waiting to see whether it will subside, the adjournment will be invalid and the meeting
may continue (John v Rees[1969] 2 All ER 274).
Another example of an invalid adjournment is to be found in Byng v London Life Association Ltd(1988)The Times, 22 December. A meeting of London Life was called to be held
at the Barbican Centre in London. The main meeting place was not large enough to hold all
those who wished to attend and the audio-visual linking system in the overflow rooms had
broken down. The chairman adjourned the meeting without the consent of the meeting as
London Lifeâ€™s articles required. His adjournment was challenged by Mr Byng, a shareholder,
because the members had not consented. However, the Court of Appeal held that even so the
chairman could use his common law right to adjourn in the difficult circumstances of the
case. However, he had not exercised it reasonably. He had adjourned the meeting only until
the afternoon of the same day at the CafÃ© Royal. He must have known that many people who
had tried to attend the meeting at the Barbican would be unable to attend at the CafÃ© Royal
in the afternoon at such short notice. Accordingly resolutions passed at the CafÃ© Royal by the
much diminished number of people who did attend were invalid. Incidentally the court also
held that a meeting may be validly held even though not everyone is in the same room, as
where some are using audio-visual equipment in overflow rooms.
Under CA 2006, s 248 every company must keep minutes of all proceedings of directorsâ€™
meetings, whether they be meetings of the full board or a committee of the board, and enter
these into a minute book. If a minute is signed by the chairman of the meeting or of the next
succeeding meeting, the minutes are prima facie evidence of the proceedings. This means that
although there is a presumption that all the proceedings were in order and that all appointments of directors, managers or liquidators are deemed to be valid, evidence can be brought
to contradict the minutes. Thus, in Re Fireproof Doors[1916] 2 Ch 142 a contract to indemnify directors was held binding though not recorded in the minutes. On the other hand, if the
articles provide that minutes duly signed by the chairman are conclusive evidence, they cannot be contradicted. Thus, in Kerr vMottram[1940] Ch 657 the claimant said that a contract
to sell him preference and ordinary shares had been agreed at a meeting. There was no record
in the minutes and since the articles of the company said that the minutes were conclusive
evidence the court would not admit evidence as to the existence of the contract.

Class meetings
Under CA 2006, s 358 the minute books are to be kept at the registered office of the
company, and the minutes of general meetings are open to the inspection of members free
of charge. Copies or extracts from the minutes must be supplied and a charge may be made.
The copy must be given within seven days of the request. The auditor of the company has
a right of inspection at all times. Minute books may be kept on a loose-leaf system so long
as there are adequate precautions to prevent fraud. However, it seems that some sort of
visual record is required and the Companies Acts would not appear to envisage tapes being
Many companies keep their statutory registers on computer using one of the software
packages available and this is permitted by CA 2006, s 1135.
CA 2008, s 355 requires every company to keep records comprising copies of all resolutions
of members passed otherwise than at general meetings, minutes of all proceedings of general
meetings and details provided to the company in accordance with s 357 (decisions of sole
members). These records must be kept for at least 10 years from the date of the resolution,
meeting or decision (as appropriate). These records relating to the previous 10 years must be
kept available for inspection at the companyâ€™s registered office in the UK or at a place designated under regulations issued by the Secretary of State pursuant to CA 2006, s 1136.
We have already referred in Chapter 1 to the need in one-member companies for the member to supply the company with a written record of decisions made at general meetings unless
they are by written resolution.
Class meetings
The provisions of CA 2006, Chapter 3 of Part 13 (Resolutions at meetings) are applicable to
meetings of the holders of a class of shares and, for companies without a share capital, for
meetings of a class of members as they do to general meetings (ss 334(1) and 335(1)) subject
to the following certain exceptions:
â— Shareholders and members may require directors to call a general meeting of the company (CA 2006, ss 303-305) but these provisions do not apply to the calling of class meetings (CA 2006, s 334(2)(a)).
â— The court has the power to call a meeting of the company (CA 2006, s 306) but this power
does not apply to the calling of a class meeting (CA 2006, s 334(2)(b)).
In connection with a variation of class rights meeting, the following differences must be noted:
â— A poll may be demanded by any holder of shares of the class or, for companies without a
share capital, any member of the class present (CA 2006, ss 334(6) and 335(5)).
â— The quorum (other than an adjourned meeting) is two persons present holding at least
one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class (excluding any shares held
as treasury shares) or, for companies without a share capital, two members of the class
present (in person or by proxy) who together represent at least one-third of the voting
rights of the class.
â— The quorum for an adjourned meeting is one person present holding shares of the class
or, for companies without a share capital, one member of the class present (in person or
by proxy) (CA 2006, ss 334(4) and 335(4)).

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
Company meetings and the disabled
The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 places a duty on those who provide goods, facilities
and services not to discriminate against disabled people. The Act applies to any person, organisation or entity which is concerned with the provision in the UK of goods, facilities or
services to the public or a section of the public. The Act will therefore apply, it would seem, if a
company meeting can be described as a meeting involving the public. In the case of a plc
which is also listed, the annual general meeting would seem to be a public meeting and consideration would have to be given, for example, to access for the disabled and the provision
of reports and accounts in Braille, together with systems designed to enable the deaf to
participate in the meeting. However, since in this connection private companies provide the
overwhelming majority of corporate structures in the UK (many with five or fewer members),
it is unlikely that the Act would apply in this context. Of course, it does a company no harm
to give proper consideration to its disabled members, if any.
Board meetings
CA 2006, s 248 provides in relevant part that every company must cause minutes of all
proceedings at meetings of its directors to be recorded and kept for at least 10 years from the
date of the meeting. If a company fails to comply with these requirements an offence is committed by every officer of the company who is in default (a fine not exceeding level 3 on the
standard scale and, for continued contravention, a daily default fine not exceeding one-tenth
of level 3 on the standard scale). CA 2006, s 249 provides that minutes recorded in accordance
with CA 2006, s 248, if purporting to be authenticated by the chairman of the meeting or by
the chairman of the next directorsâ€™ meeting, are evidence of the proceedings at the meeting.
Where minutes have been made in accordance with the proceedings of a board of directors,
CA 2006, s 249(2) provides that until the contrary is proved the meeting is deemed duly held
and convened, all proceedings at the meeting are deemed to have duly taken place and all
appointments at the meeting are deemed valid.
The provisions of the Model Articles for private companies limited by shares contain
several articles of note with respect to Directorsâ€™ Meetings. These articles of note are also found
in the provision of the Model Articles for private companies limited by guarantee as well.
Article 7 requires that decision-making by directors must be either a majority decision at a
meeting or by unanimous decision when taken in accordance with Article 8. If the company
only has one director, and no provision of the articles requires it to have more than one director, the general rule does not apply, and the director may take decisions without regard to any
of the provisions of the articles relating to directorsâ€™ decision-making. Article 8requires that
a decision of the directors is taken in accordance with this article when all eligible directors
indicate to each other by any means that they share a common view on a matter. It also
requires that a decision may not be taken in accordance with Article 8if the eligible directors
would not have formed a quorum at such a meeting.
Article 9 provides for the specifics of calling a directorsâ€™ meeting which is done by any
director or directors giving notice of the meeting to the directors or by authorising the company secretary (if any) to give such notice. The notice of the meeting must indicate: (a) its

Board meetings
proposed date and time; (b) where it is to take place; and (c) if it is anticipated that directors
participating in the meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they should
communicate with each other during the meeting. Notice of a directorsâ€™ meeting must be
given to each director, but need not be in writing. Notice of a directorsâ€™ meeting need not be
given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to
that effect to the company not more than 7 days after the date on which the meeting is held.
Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of
the meeting, or of any business conducted at it.
Article 10 provides for participation in directorsâ€™ meetings. Subject to the articles, directors participate in a directorsâ€™ meeting, or part of a directorsâ€™ meeting, when the meeting has
been called and takes place in accordance with the articles, and they can each communicate
to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of
the meeting. In determining whether directors are participating in a directorsâ€™ meeting, it is
irrelevant where any director is or how they communicate with each other. If all the directors
participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be
treated as taking place wherever any of them is.
Article 11 provides that unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is to be voted on,
except a proposal to call another meeting. The quorum for directorsâ€™ meetings may be fixed
from time to time by a decision of the directors, but it must never be less than two, and unless
otherwise fixed, it is two. If the total number of directors for the time being is less than the
quorum required, the directors must not take any decision other than a decision to appoint
further directors, or to call a general meeting so as to enable the shareholders to appoint
further directors.
Article 12allows that directors may appoint a director to chair their meetings who for the
time being is known as the chairman. The directors may terminate the chairmanâ€™s appointment at any time. If the chairman is not participating in a directorsâ€™ meeting within 10
minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint one of
themselves to chair it.
Article 13allows for casting vote procedures, namely, that if the numbers of votes for and
against a proposal are equal, the chairman or other director chairing the meeting has a casting
vote. However, this does not apply if, in accordance with the articles, the chairman or other
director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum
or voting purposes.
Article 14provides that if a proposed decision of the directors is concerned with an actual
or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company in which a director is interested,
that director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum
or voting purposes. However, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in the decisionmaking process for quorum and voting purposes.
Finally, pursuant to Article 15, the directors must ensure that the company keeps a record,
in writing, for at least 10 years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or
majority decision taken by the directors. Article 16 allows directors the discretion to make
further rules: â€˜any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how
such rules are to be recorded or communicated to directors.â€™
With respect to the Model Articles for Public Companies, there are many similarities to
the Model Articles for Private Companies except that there are some additional provisions
respecting the more formal decision making processes of public companies.

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
Article 12 provides that (unlike in the private companies), the directors may appoint
other directors as deputy or assistant chairmen to chair directorsâ€™ meetings in the chairmanâ€™s
absence which are terminable at any time. If neither the chairman nor any director appointed
generally to chair directorsâ€™ meetings in the chairmanâ€™s absence is participating in a meeting
within 10 minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint
one of themselves to chair it.
Article 15provides that a director who is also an alternate director has an additional vote
on behalf of each appointor who is not participating in a directorsâ€™ meeting and would have
been entitled to vote if they were participating in it.
Article 16provides that if a directorsâ€™ meeting, or part of a directorsâ€™ meeting, is concerned
with an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company in which a director
is interested, that director is not to be counted as participating in that meeting, or part of a
meeting, for quorum or voting purposes. A director who is interested in an actual or proposed
transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in a decision
at a directorsâ€™ meeting, or part of a directorsâ€™ meeting, relating to it for quorum and voting
purposes when the company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the articles
which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in, or voting
at, a directorsâ€™ meeting; the directorâ€™s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give
rise to a conflict of interest; or the directorâ€™s conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause.
A â€˜permitted causeâ€™ includes: (a) a guarantee given, or to be given, by or to a director in respect
of an obligation incurred by or on behalf of the company or any of its subsidiaries; (b) subscription, or an agreement to subscribe, for shares or other securities of the company or any
of its subsidiaries, or to underwrite, sub-underwrite, or guarantee subscription for any such
shares or securities; and (c) arrangements pursuant to which benefits are made available
to employees and directors or former employees and directors of the company or any of its
subsidiaries which do not provide special benefits for directors or former directors.
Article 17 provides that any director may propose a directorsâ€™ written resolution but the
company secretary must propose a directorsâ€™ written resolution if a director so requests.
A directorsâ€™ written resolution is proposed by giving notice of the proposed resolution to the
directors indicating the proposed resolution, and the time by which it is proposed that the
directors should adopt it. The notice must be given in writing to each director and any decision which a person giving notice of a proposed directorsâ€™ written resolution takes regarding
the process of adopting that resolution must be taken reasonably in good faith.
Article 18 provides that a proposed directorsâ€™ written resolution is adopted when all the
directors who would have been entitled to vote on the resolution at a directorsâ€™ meeting have
signed one or more copies of it, provided that those directors would have formed a quorum
at such a meeting. It is immaterial whether any director signs the resolution before or after
the time by which the notice proposed that it should be adopted. Once a directorsâ€™ written
resolution has been adopted, it must be treated as if it had been a decision taken at a directorsâ€™ meeting in accordance with the articles. The company secretary must ensure that the
company keeps a record, in writing, of all directorsâ€™ written resolutions for at least 10 years
from the date of their adoption.
The powers of the directors must be exercised collectively at a board meeting and not individually, though an informal agreement made by them all will bind the company. This is
envisaged by Table A which provides that a resolution in writing signed by all the directors
entitled to receive notice of a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors shall be as
valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of directors or (as the case may be) a

Board meetings
committee of directors duly convened and held and may consist of several documents in the
like form each signed by one or more directors; but a resolution signed by an alternate director
need not also be signed by his appointor and if it is signed by a director who has appointed
an alternate director, it need not be signed by the alternate director in that capacity.
A meeting of the board can be called by any director unless the articles otherwise provide.
Table A provides that a director may, and the secretary shall at the request of a director,
summon a meeting of the board. Regulations 88-98 Table A (Proceedings of Directors)remains
unchanged since the passage of the CA 2006 as there are no comparable provisions in the
Notice of board meetings
Notice of a board meeting should normally be given to all the directors and the time must be
reasonable. This may be a matter of days, hours, or even minutes, depending on the circumstances. It has been held that three hoursâ€™ notice to directors who had other business to attend
to was insufficient, even though their places of business and the place where the board meeting was to be held were all in the City of London (Re Homer District Consolidated Gold Mines
Ltd, ex parte Smith (1888) 39 Ch D 546). On the other hand, five minutesâ€™ notice to a director was held sufficient where neither distance nor other engagements prevented him from
attending (Browne v La Trinidad(1887) 37 Ch D 1). Notice of a board meeting need not be
given to a director whose whereabouts are unknown because, for example, he is travelling,
and Table A provides that notice need not be sent to a director who is for the time being absent
from the United Kingdom, e.g. where he is absent on business; but unless the articles are in
the form of Table A, notice must be given to all directors if their whereabouts are known.
The effect of failure to give proper notice is uncertain, but it is the better view that it does
not render resolutions passed at the meeting void. The law is not entirely clear, but in Re
Homer, etc. (above) it was held that all resolutions passed at the meeting were void, whereas
in Browne v La Trinidad (above) it was held that failure to give proper notice to a director
merely entitles him to require that a second meeting be held if he does not attend the first.
If he does not require a second meeting to be held within a reasonable time, then he waives
his right to ask for it and the resolutions passed at the first meeting are then valid. The notice
need only specify when and where the meeting is to be held. It is not necessary to set out the
business to be transacted but in practice it is usual to do so.
This is normally fixed by the articles, and Table A provides that the quorum shall be fixed by
the directors and unless so fixed shall be two. A private company may have only one director,
and if this is intended to be so in practice the articles should provide for a quorum of one.
Alternatively, the sole director could presumably fix the quorum at one and minute the decision.
A person who holds office only as an alternate director shall, if his appointor is not present,
be counted in the quorum. This does not, of course, apply to a private company with only one
director. Certainly no business can be validly transacted without a quorum, and the quorum
must if the articles so require (Re Greymouth Point Elizabeth Rail & Coal Co Ltd[1904] 1 Ch
32) consist of directors who are not personally interested in the business which is before the
meeting, although in such a case interested directors are entitled to notice of the meeting and
may attend and speak but not vote.

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
As regards personal interest, Table A provides as follows. A director shall not vote at a
meeting of directors or of a committee of directors on any resolution concerning a matter in
which he has, directly or indirectly, an interest or duty which is material and which conflicts,
or may conflict, with the interest of the company unless his interest or duty arises only
because the case falls within one or more of the following areas:
(a) the resolution relates to the giving to him of a guarantee, security or indemnity in respect
of money lent to, or an obligation by him for the benefit of, the company or any of its
subsidiaries;
(b) the resolution relates to the giving to a third party of a guarantee, security or indemnity
in respect of an obligation of the company or any of its subsidiaries for which the director has assumed responsibility in whole or part and whether alone or jointly with others
under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security;
(c) his interest arises by reason of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe for any shares,
debentures, or other securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or by reason of
his being, or intending to become, a participant in the underwriting or sub-underwriting
of an offer of any such shares, debentures or other securities by the company or any of its
subsidiaries for subscription, purchase or exchange;
(d) the resolution relates in any way to a retirement benefit scheme which has been approved,
or is conditional upon approval, by HMRC for taxation purposes.
For the purposes of Table A an interest of a person who is, for any purpose of the
Companies Act, connected with a director shall be treated as an interest of the director and in
relation to an alternate director, an interest of his appointor shall be treated as an interest of
the alternate director in addition to his own interests. A director shall not be counted in the
quorum present at a meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.
A director may vote on the appointment of a fellow director to an office of profit under
the company, but not on his own appointment. The company may by ordinary resolution
suspend or relax to any extent, either generally or in respect of any particular matter, any
pro-vision of the articles prohibiting a director from voting at a meeting of directors or of
a committee of directors. If the company is to have a listing on the Stock Exchange, the rules
of the Stock Exchange require that the companyâ€™s articles follow the above provisions of
Table A in terms of directorsâ€™ interests, otherwise a listing will not be granted.
Voting at board meetings
The voting at board meetings is usually governed by the articles and is normally one vote per
director, but Table A provides, as we have seen, that directors with a personal interest in the
business before the meeting are not allowed to vote. A majority of one will carry a resolution,
though an equality of votes means that the resolution is lost, unless the position is resolved
by the use of the chairmanâ€™s casting vote if he is given one under the articles. Table A gives
the directors power to appoint a chairman to preside at board meetings and give him a casting vote.
Every company must keep minutes of all proceedings at directorsâ€™ meetings, and where there
are managers all proceedings at meetings of managers must be entered in books kept for that

Resolutions - generally
purpose. When the minutes are signed by the chairman of the meeting, or by the chairman of
the next succeeding meeting, they are prima facie evidence of the proceedings. The members
have no general right to inspect the minutes of directorsâ€™ meetings (Rv Merchant Tailors Co
(1831) 2 B & Ad 115), but the directors have.
Meetings by telephone
As we have seen, Table A allows written resolutions of directors to be as effective as resolutions passed in a board meeting. Therefore, Table A does not require a â€˜face to faceâ€™ meeting
either in the 1985 version or the 1948 version (see Part I, Art 106 - plcs; and Part II, Arts 1
and 5 - private companies).
Thus, if the relevant provisions were altered to allow valid decisions to be taken by
telephone, either by the chairman obtaining the agreement of the majority of the board
having contacted them all by telephone or by means of a â€˜conferenceâ€™ call, there would be no
need for a meeting of the board. Impersonation of a director could arise but should not in
general be a serious problem. A record equivalent to minutes would have to be kept. As
regards general meetings of members, this does not have the same impact for change in the
articles as in the case of board meetings. In view of the written resolution procedure and
the infrequency of general meetings compared with board meetings, there is obviously less
point in such a change. After all, a unanimous written resolution is effective as soon as the
last member has signed his copy and a telephone call to each member to ascertain this means
that the business which was the subject matter of the resolution can be proceeded with. There
is no need to wait until the separate copies are returned (though they must be) and collated
in one place.
Resolutions - generally
First, it must be noted that written resolutions under Chapter 2 of Part 13 of CA 2006
are exclusively for the use of private companies. CA 2006, s 281 limits the ways in which
resolutions can be passed and has the effect that written resolutions can only be passed
using the procedure set out in Chapter 2 of Part 13. While the common law principle of
unanimous consent does continue to apply under CA 2006, s 1(4)), CA 2006, s 300 provides
that the articles of a private company cannot override the ability to pass written resolutions under Chapter 2 of Part 13 of CA 2006. As such, despite whatever a private companyâ€™s
articles might say, Chapter 2 of Part 13 of CA 2006 predominates. Again it is critical to
note that the statutory written resolution procedure cannot be used by public companies
at all pursuant to CA 2006, s 281(2)). Moreover, the common law position on unanimous
consent also known as the Duomaticprinciple (see below) remains in effect under CA 2006,
At the same time, there are limitations on the use of written resolutions for private
companies (CA 2006, s 288 (2)). Such a mechanism, for instance, cannot be used to remove
a director from office before the expiration of his term in office under s 168; or the auditors
from office before the expiration of their term in office under s 510. Instead, both of these
decisions require actual meetings of the companyâ€™s members to be held and require the
special notice provisions as set out in CA 2006, s 312.

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
1 Special resolutions
A special resolution is one passed by a majority of not less than three-quarters of such members as are entitled to and do vote in person, or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy, at a general meeting of which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special
resolution has been duly given (CA 2006, s 283). CA 2006, s 307 removed one of the big
differences between special and ordinary resolutions for non-traded companies that existed
under CA 1985. CA 1985 required 21 clear daysâ€™ notice for a meeting at which a special resolution was proposed to be passed and 14 clear daysâ€™ notice was required for a meeting at which
an ordinary resolution was to be passed.
CA 2006, s 307(1) now provides that any general meeting of a non-traded private company
(other than an adjourned meeting) must be called by notice of at least 14 days (subject always
to shorter notice being agreed by the members). The notice period no longer depends on the
type of resolutions being proposed and is 14 days for all general meetings of non-traded private companies (and 14 days for all general meetings of non-traded public companies apart
from annual general meetings of public companies, where the notice period remains 21 days
under CA 2006, s 307(2)). CA 2006, ss 29 and 30 mandate the requirement for copies of all
special resolutions that are passed to be filed with the Registrar of Companies within 15 days
of the resolutions being passed. This requirement is carried over from CA 1985, s 380.
CA 2006, s 281 states that where any provision of CA 2006 requires a resolution of a company or its members and it does not specify what kind of resolution, an ordinary resolution
will be required unless the companyâ€™s articles require a higher majority or unanimity. When
a provision specifies that an ordinary resolution is required, the articles will not be able to
specify a higher majority.
CA 2006, s 283 defines a special resolution as a resolution passed by a majority of not less
than 75 per cent. Section 283 distinguishes between a special resolution passed at a meeting
on a show of hands and a special resolution passed on a poll taken at a meeting. CA 2006, s
283(4) provides that a resolution passed at a meeting on a show of hands is passed by a majority of at least 75 per cent if it is passed by not less than 75 per cent of the votes cast by those
entitled to vote. CA 2006, s 283(5) provides a resolution passed on a poll taken at a meeting
is passed by a majority of at least 75 per cent if it is passed by members representing 75 per
cent (or more) of the total voting rights of members who, being entitled to vote, do so in
person or by proxy.
CA 2006, s 283 deals with the situation of special resolutions passed by means of a written
resolution. CA 2006, s 283(2) provides that a written resolution is passed by a majority of at
least 75 per cent if it is passed by members representing at least 75 per cent of the total voting
rights of eligible members. CA 2006, s 283(3) provides that where a resolution of a private
company is passed as a written resolution, the resolution will not be a special resolution
unless the written resolution states that the resolution was proposed as a special resolution.
Accordingly, if the written resolution states that it was proposed as a special resolution, it may
only be passed as such. Thus, it is now clear that a written resolution is specifically required
to state on its face that it is intended as a special resolution for it to qualify as a special resolution. This brings written resolutions into alignment with special resolutions passed in general meetings which expressly require the statement in the notice of general meeting that the
resolution is proposed as a special resolution.
CA 2006, s 283(6) indicates what is to be required to be included in a notice of general
meeting at which a special resolution is proposed to be passed. Chiefly, the notice of general

Resolutions - generally
meeting must specify the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution but also
specifies that the text of the special resolution must be included in the notice.
2 Ordinary resolutions
CA 2006, s 281 provides that, where any provision of CA 2006 requires a resolution of a company or its members and it does not specify what kind of resolution, an ordinary resolution
will be required unless the companyâ€™s articles require a higher majority or unanimity. When
a provision specifies that an ordinary resolution is required, the articles will not be able to
specify a higher majority. Extraordinary resolutions - found in the CA 1985 - was not incorporated into the CA 2006.
Ordinary resolutions are defined in CA 2006, s 282 as a resolution that is passed by a simple
majority. The same section also distinguishes between an ordinary resolution passed at a
meeting on a show of hands and an ordinary resolution passed on a poll taken at a meeting.
Additionally, CA 2006, s 282(2) covers a written resolution that is passed by a simple majority if it is passed by members representing more than 50 per cent of the total voting rights of
eligible members.
For companies incorporated before 1 October 2007, the Fifth Commencement Order
(paragraph 2(5), Schedule 5) provides that if, immediately before 1 October 2007, the articles
of a company provided for the chairman to have a casting vote in the event of equality of votes
(whether on a show of hands or on a poll) on an ordinary resolution proposed at a general
meeting and that provision has not been removed from the articles, it continues to have effect
notwithstanding ss 281(3) and 282. In addition, if there was such a provision in the articles immediately before 1 October 2007 and it was removed from the articles on or after 1 October 2007,
the company may, at any time, restore that provision and it will be effective notwithstanding
ss 281(3) and 282. For traded companies only, this saving provision for the casting vote was
removed from 3 August 2009, by the Companies (Shareholdersâ€™ Rights) Regulations 2009.
CA 2006, s 282(5) provides that anything that may be done by ordinary resolution may also
be done by special resolution.
Sections 29 and 30 (which came into force on 1 October 2007) provide that a copy of every
resolution affecting a companyâ€™s constitution must be forwarded to the Registrar of
Companies within 15 days after it is passed. This includes resolutions to which the requirement applies by virtue of â€˜any enactmentâ€™ (which could include ordinary resolutions if they
affect a companyâ€™s constitution).
There was no change made by the CA 2006 to the requirement for special notice of at least
28 days in respect of an ordinary resolution to remove a director before the expiration of his
period of office (CA 2006, s 168) or remove an auditor before the expiration of his term of
office (CA 2006, s 511).
Seconding resolutions
The chairman can put any resolution to the meeting without its being seconded though
not if the articles forbid it (Re Horbury Bridge Coal, Iron & Wagon Co(1879) 11 Ch D 109).
Whether a resolution requires a seconder and whether that seconder must be a member
depends upon the articles. Table A does not require a seconder at all so that the motion or
resolution could be put to the meeting after proposal and no seconder is required at common
law (see Re Horbury Bridge Coal, Iron & Wagon Co, 1879, above).

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
Registration of resolutions
Special resolutions must be registered with the Registrar of Companies. This is achieved under
CA 2006, s 30 by sending a printed copy of the resolution to the Registrar within 15 days after
its passing. It is not necessary to send a printedcopy of the resolution to the Registrar if instead
the company forwards a copy in some other form approved by him. A copy of each such resolution must also be embodied in or attached to every copy of the articles of association
issued after the passing of the resolution.
âž¨ See p. 226 It has already been noted (see Chapter 11 âž¨) that if shares in a public company are forfeited or surrendered to the company, the company must see to it that the shares are disposed
of and if this has not been done within three years it must cancel the shares. If the result of
this is that the companyâ€™s issued share capital is brought below the authorised minimum, the
company will have to apply for re-registration as a private company, and a resolution of the
directors is sufficient to change the companyâ€™s memorandum of association to prepare it for
re-registration. That resolution of the directors is registrable with the Registrar within 15 days
of its being passed.
The Electronic Communications Order 2000 enables the Registrar to direct that any document required to be delivered to him under the Companies Act or the Insolvency Act 1986
may be delivered electronically in a manner decided by him.
Ordinary resolutions requiring special notice
An ordinary resolution of which special notice has been given is required in the following cases:
(a) to remove a director before the expiration of his period of office (CA 2006, s 168). The
section does not prevent companies from attaching special voting rights to certain shares
âž¨ See p. 438 on this occasion (Bushellv Faith, 1969, see Chapter 21 âž¨); or
(b) to remove an auditor before the expiration of his term of office (CA 2006, s 511).
It should be noted that the actual resolution need not be moved at the meeting by the same
member who served the special notice.
Amendments
As regards amendments to resolutions, which must be set out verbatim, such as special and
extraordinary resolutions, it is often suggested that no amendment is possible since the
Companies Acts require notice of the resolution and some say, by implication, of any amendment, because if the resolution is changed by an amendment then proper notice has not been
given of that part of it which was amended. It is generally believed that this view is too strict,
and indeed in Re Moorgate Mercantile Holdings[1980] 1 All ER 40 Mr Justice Slade decided
that such a resolution could depart in some respects from the text of the resolution set out in
the notice, e.g. on account of correction of grammatical or clerical errors, or the use of more
formal language. However, apart from alterations of form of this kind, there must be no alterations of substance; otherwise only where all the members (in the case of an annual general
meeting) or a majority in number and 95 per cent in value of members (in the case of any

Written resolutions for private companies (s 288, CA 2006 et seq.)
other meeting) have waived their rights to notice, could a special resolution be validly passed.
The judge also decided that in the case of notice of intention to propose a special resolution
nothing is achieved by the addition of such words as â€˜with such amendments and alterations
as shall be determined on at the general meetingâ€™.
The facts of the case were that the company wished to reduce its share premium account
on the grounds that it had been lost in the course of trade. The share premium account to be
cancelled was stated in the notice to be Â£1,356,900 48p. That figure included the sum of Â£321
17p which had been credited to the share premium account under an issue of shares made on
the acquisition of the outstanding minority interest in a subsidiary. This share premium could
not be regarded as lost. At the meeting the chairman proposed to amend the special resolution and, although not all the members of the company were present, a special resolution
was passed in the following form: â€˜That the share premium account of the company amounting to Â£1,356,900 48p be reduced to Â£321 17p.â€™ The court was then asked to agree to the
reduction and the judge refused to do so on the grounds that the special resolution had not
been validly passed.
Subject to what has been said above, once a resolution has been moved and, if the articles
require, seconded, any member may speak and move amendments. No notice of the amendments is required unless the amendment effects a substantial change in the original resolution, i.e. is the change such that a reasonable man who had decided to absent himself from
the meeting would have decided to come if he had received notice of the amended resolution?
This is a decision which the chairman must take and hope that if his decision is questioned in
court the judge will agree with him. For example, in Re Teede and Bishop Ltd (1901) 70 LJ Ch
409 it was held that at a meeting to resolve that A Ltd should be sold to B Ltd and then that
A Ltd should be wound up, it was not in order to accept an amendment that A Ltd be wound
up without the sale to B Ltd unless notice had been given of it.
Amendments must be put to the vote before the resolution is voted upon. Improper refusal
by the chairman to put an amendment renders the main resolution void (Henderson v Bank
of Australasia(1890) 45 Ch D 330).
Resolutions and t he â€˜Duomatic principleâ€™ of unanimous consent
Where all the shareholders of a company assent to a matter that could be brought into effect
by a resolution in general meeting the unanimous consent of the shareholders without a formal meeting is enough. This is called the â€˜Duomaticprincipleâ€™ from the case in which it was
most famously canvassed, i.e. Re Duomatic[1969] 1 All ER 161. Alterations in the articles can
be achieved in this way and in this connection the Duomatic principle has been applied to
changes in shareholdersâ€™ agreements that are often used in private companies to supplement
the articles in confidential areas of governance (see Euro Brokers Holdings Ltd v Monecor
(London) Ltd[2003] 1 BCLC 506).
Written resolutions for private companies
(s 288, CA 2006 et seq.)
Written resolutions no longer have to be agreed by all members, but merely a simple majority or a three-quarters majority as appropriate depending on whether a resolution is ordinary

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
or special (CA 2006, ss 281(2) and 283(2)). Two types of resolution for which the written
resolution is not permissible are the resolution to remove a director (CA 2006, s 168) and the
resolution to remove an auditor (CA 2006, s 510). These two exceptions are in effect even for
a private company and nothing in the articles of any company may preclude these provisions
requiring a meeting (CA 2006, s 510). CA 2006, ss 288(4) and (5) contain saving provisions
for those written resolutions entered into before Chapter 2 comes into force. CA 2006, s 296
sets forth the procedure for a member to signify his agreement to a proposed written resolution. CA 2006, s 291 governs written resolutions proposed by directors while CA 2006, s 292
governs written resolutions proposed by members. CA 2006, s 298 governs situations involving electronic communications with respect to written resolutions.
There are some cases where the written resolution procedure cannot be used, e.g. the
removal of a director or auditor by ordinary resolution after special notice to the company.
The ordinary resolution must be passed at a meeting of the company because the director or
auditor concerned is allowed to make representations as to why he should not be removed,
either in writing with the notice of the meeting, or orally at the meeting.
The company is required to keep a record of written resolutions and the signatures of those
members who signed them in a record book which is, in effect, a substitute for what would,
in the case of a meeting, be the minutes.
Written resolutions: special adaptations
Schedule 15A of the CA 1985 formerly contained special adaptations to the written resolution
procedure in certain circumstances, e.g. where documents have to be available at the meeting
at which the resolution is passed, if that method were followed instead of a written procedure
where there is no meeting, as in approval of a directorâ€™s service contract exceeding five years,
where the contract must be supplied to members before or at the time of signing the resolution instead of being available at the meeting where a non-written resolution is passed.
These can now be found in the CA 2006: ss 571(7), 573(5), 695(2), 698(2), 696(2), 699(2),
717(2), 718(2) and 188(5).
Filing of written resolutions
There is no general need to file a written resolution with the Registrar unless it takes effect,
e.g. as a special or elective resolution or an ordinary resolution increasing authorised share
capital. Even where a written resolution does have to be filed, there is no requirement to file
the original. A copy can be filed and the signed copy kept in the minute book. In connection
with the filing of written resolutions, Companies House states that it has received copies of
â€˜written special resolutionsâ€™. There is, of course, no such thing. There are written resolutions
which take effect as special resolutions. It would be a better approach to indicate on the filed
copy and minute copy of the resolution that it took effect as a special resolution.
Involvement of auditors
CA 2006, s 502, replacing CA 1985, s 390, requires an auditor to receive much of the information that members of the company are entitled to receive including information concerning written resolutions of a private company and notices of and communications relating to
a general meeting of a company.

Electronic communications - CA 2006
Meetings of single-member companies
The amendments of the law relating to meetings to accommodate the single-member com-
âž¨ See p. 2 pany have already been considered in Chapter 1 âž¨.
Electronic communications - CA 2006
The electronic communications provisions of Companies Act 2006, namely, ss 1143-1148,
Schedules 4 and 5 have now been implemented. It should be noted at first that these provisions apply to all types of companies. The earlier distinctions made between companies whose
shares are traded on a stock exchange and those whose shares were not traded has been eliminated. CA 2006 allows any information or documents to be communicated in electronic
form, provided that the requirements of the CA 2006 are met.
Definitions of electronic form and electronic means
(CA 2006, s 1168)
A document sent in â€˜electronic formâ€™ means that the document or information is sent or
supplied by electronic means (for example, by e-mail or fax) or by any other means while
in electronic form (for example, sending a disk by post). The same section also states that a
document or information is sent by â€˜electronic meansâ€™ if it is sent initially and received at its
destination by means of electronic equipment for the processing or storage of data or entirely
transmitted, conveyed and received by wire, radio, optical means or other electromagnetic
means. A document or information sent by â€˜electronic meansâ€™ must also be sent in such a
form that the sender or supplier reasonably considerswill enable the recipient to read it and
retain a copy of it. In CA 2006, s 1169 â€˜readâ€™ means that the document or information can be
read with the naked eye, or, if it consists of images, pictures, maps, plans or drawings, etc., it
can be seen with the naked eye.
CA 2006 - Schedules 4 and 5
CA 2006 makes a distinction between communications by a company (Schedule 4) and
communications to a company (Schedule 5). Please note however that in the situation where
there are two companies communicating, e.g., a proxy fight, it is only the rules relating to
communications by a company that are applicable.
Schedule 4 - Communications to a company
If the company agrees, documents may be sent to or served on it by electronic means. The
address is that specified by the company and so, for example, it could be an email address
or fax number. In some situations, the company is deemed to have consented to receiving
documents electronically. For example if it publishes an electronic address in a notice convening a general meeting, CA 2006 provides that the company is deemed to have consented
to receiving documents relating to that meeting, such as proxies, at that electronic address.
If a document is sent in electronic form by hand or by post (e.g. a CD-ROM or floppy disk)

Chapter 21 Meetings and resolutions
then it must be sent to the companyâ€™s registered office or to the address provided by the
company for receipt of hard copy correspondence. The company may also agree to receive
documents in a form other than hard copy or electronic form.
Schedule 5 - Communications by a company
Schedule 5 provides a method for communications in both hard copy form and electronic
form. With respect to communications in electronic form, if the recipient agrees, the company may supply information and documents in electronic form to the address provided for
that purpose by the recipient. If the document or information is sent in electronic form by
post or delivered by hand (for instance on a computer disk or CD-ROM), it must be handed
to the intended recipient or sent or supplied to an address to which it could be validly sent if
it were in hard copy form.
Communications by means of a website (Part 4 of Schedule 5 to
A company may communicate via its website with its members if its members have resolved
that the company may communicate with members through a website or the companyâ€™s articles must contain a provision to this effect. The resolution must be filed at Companies House.
Each member must be individually asked by the company to consent to communication by
means of a website (either generally or in relation to specific documents). The companyâ€™s
request must clearly state the effect of a failure to respond by the member (for instance, that
he or she would be deemed to have consented if he or she does not reply within 28 days starting with the date on which the request is sent). The companyâ€™s request must not be sent less
than 12 months after a previous request made to that member in respect of a similar class of
documents. If the company satisfies all of this, it can communicate via a website with any
members who consent or who fail to respond within 28 days starting with the date on which
the request is sent. If a member says he or she does not want to be communicated with via a
website, the company must wait 12 months before it asks the member again for consent in
relation to the specific documents for which consent was originally sought.
Procedures to be followed after consent is obtained (Schedule 5)
Once needed consents are obtained (from all or some of the members), the company must
take the following steps:
â— A document or information on a website must be made available in a form, and by a
means, that the company reasonably considers will enable the recipient to read it and
retain a copy of it.
â— The company must notify the intended recipient of the presence of a document or information on a website, the address of the website, the place on the website where it may be
accessed and how to access the document or information.
â— Unless the member has also consented to being contacted by electronic means, this means
that this information must be provided in hard copy form such as letter.
â— The company must make the document or information available on the website throughout the period specified by any applicable provision of the Companies Acts or, if no such
period is specified, the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the notification
that the document is available on the website is sent to the person in question.

Essay questions
Right to request hard copy form (CA 2006, s 1145)
If the member so requests, the company must provide a hard copy form of any document sent
by electronic means or made available on a website, within 21 days of receipt of the request
and for no charge. Failure of a company to comply with this requirement means that the company and every officer in default commits an offence and are liable to a fine and a daily fine
while the contravention continues.
CA 2006, s 1146 - authentication of electronic communications
Section 1146 provides that an electronic communication is authenticated if the identity of the
sender is confirmed in the manner specified by the company or, in the absence of such
specification, the document contains statement of the identity of the sender and the company
has no reason to doubt the truth of the statement.
Conclusions
We live in an age where we use the Internet and e-mail to communicate with each other ever
more often. The electronic communications reforms are designed to save companies significant postage and printing costs while contributing to increased sustainability of the planet
by reducing the use of paper. However, a companyâ€™s use of e-mails and websites for communications is entirely dependent on consent of the member which can be withdrawn at any
time. In addition, if a website is to be used as a basis to communicate with members, special
procedures such as agreement to a resolution authorising such communications must be
obtained as well. In short, while it may be environmentally friendly, it may not be feasible to
expect that a large company will be able to communicate with all its members electronically at
all times. Some members will always feel more comfortable with receiving â€˜snail-mailâ€™ instead.

Debentures and charges

Debentures - generally
In this chapter we shall be concerned with a companyâ€™s loan capital and the means of securing loans by charging the companyâ€™s assets.
Power to borrow
A trading company has implied power to borrow (General Auction Estate and Monetary Co
v Smith[1891] 3 Ch 432). Nevertheless, prior to the CA 2006, it was usual for an express power
to be given in the memorandum, and such express powers may impose some limit on the
companyâ€™s borrowing by stating a fixed sum beyond which the company cannot borrow, or
by limiting the borrowing, say, to one-half of the issued share capital. A non-trading company
has no implied borrowing powers and must take express power to borrow in its constitution.
A power to borrow, whether express or implied, carries with it by a further implication of
law a power to give a security for the loan and to pay interest upon it (General Auction Estate
& Monetary Cov Smith, 1891, above). Once again, it is usual for the companyâ€™s constitution
to give an express power to do these things, though an express power cannot override the
Companies Act. Thus, it would not be possible to charge the companyâ€™s reserve capital since
this is expressly forbidden by the provisions of the Act, which renders such capital incapable
âž¨ See p. 129 of being called up except on a winding-up (see Chapter 6 âž¨).
As regards the directors, Table Agives the board all powers to manage and there is no need
for a specificpower to borrow. There is no limit on the amount the directors can borrow so
long as they remain within the companyâ€™s power. However, in view of the provisions of CA
âž¨ See p. 129 2006, s 39 and s 40 (see Chapter 6 âž¨), borrowing by the directors beyond the provisions of
the companyâ€™s constitution is much less likely to affect a contract of loan with an outsider
such as a bank.
The directors must obtain member approval before allotting convertible debentures, i.e.
debentures which carry rights of conversion into share capital. As we have seen, a public company should not borrow money until it has received a CA 2006, s 762 certificate allowing it to
âž¨ See p. 2 trade, though this does not affect the enforceability of the loan (see Chapter 1 âž¨).
Debentures - generally
The most usual form of borrowing by companies is by means of debentures. The debenture
also gives a charge on the companyâ€™s property. The word â€˜debentureâ€™ has its origin in a Latin
word for â€˜owingâ€™.
As regards a definition, a debenture is a document executed by a company as a deed in
favour of a creditor, providing the creditor with security over the whole or substantially the
whole of the companyâ€™s assets and undertaking, normally creating a fixed charge over fixed
assets such as land and buildings and a floating charge over the rest of the companyâ€™s assets
such as stock and giving the creditor power to appoint an administrative receiver with extensive authority to collect in the assets, run the companyâ€™s business and dispose of the assets
either one at a time or as part of a sale of the business as a going concern. Under the Companies Acts, debenture includes debenture stock, bonds and other securities of a company,
whether or not constituting a charge on the assets of the company.

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
Debenture holders are creditors (but consider the position under a trust deed) and not
members of the company, and are entitled to interest on their debentures whether the company earns profits or not. Holders are provided with a safe if limited income, and debentures
appeal to a cautious investor.
Debentures may also be convertiblewhich means that they are issued with an option, tenable
for a certain period of time, to exchange them for shares in the company. Debentures can be
issued at a discount without restriction, but the issue of convertible debentures must not be
allowed to operate as a device to issue shares at a discount as would be the case if a debenture for
Â£100, issued at Â£90, were later to be exchanged for 100 shares of nominal value of Â£1 each. This
would in effect be an issue of shares at a discount which is forbidden by the Companies Acts.
Types of debentures
Debentures may be issued in a series, e.g. where there is a public offer, or alternatively they
may be issued singly, e.g. to secure a bank loan or overdraft. They may also be issued in
respect of either an existing debt or a fresh loan.
In the case of a public offer the admission of debentures to listing must comply with Part
VI of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The Public Offers of Securities Regulations
1995, which regulated a public offer of unlisted debentures, was repealed in 2005. These
âž¨ See p. 212 matters are considered in Chapter 10 âž¨.
Where debentures are issued in a series, it is usual to provide expressly that they are to rank
pari passu, i.e. equally. This is essential because loans rank for priority according to the time
they are made, and if such an express provision were not made, the debentures in the series
would rank for priority of payment and security according to the date of issue, and if all were
issued on the same day, they would rank in numerical order.
Gartsidev Silkstone and Dodworth Coal and Iron Co Ltd(1882) 21 Ch D 762
The company issued 150 debentures of Â£100 each on the same day. They were issued in two lots,
one lot being numbered 501-600 and the second lot 601-650. Each of the debentures contained
a provision that it was to rank pari passuwith the others, but the first group referred to the amount
of Â£10,000 and the second to Â£5,000, this being the only difference in the respective provisions.
Nevertheless, this suggested that they were independent issues. The company was in liquidation
and the question of priority arose. When two deeds are executed on the same day, the court must
inquire which of them was executed first, but if there is anything in the deeds to show such an
intention, they may take effect pari passu.
Held- by the High Court - the company could, therefore, choose to give security in the form of a
second floating charge of the kind outlined, and this was valid and did rank equally with the first
charge because they were expressed to be pari passu.
Where debentures rank pari passu, there can be no action at law brought by an individual
debenture holder merely in respect of his own rights, and any such action brought by him is
deemed to be a representative action on behalf of all the debenture holders of the series.
Debenture stock may be issued so long as the stock is fully paid, and this affects transfer.
A debenture must be transferred as a whole unit whereas debenture stock can be transferred

Types of debentures
in part, though the articles or the terms of issue usually fix a minimum amount which can be
transferred, e.g. Â£1.
Debentures are usually secured, registeredand redeemable, though they may be unsecured,
unregistered (i.e. bearer debentures) and irredeemable.
Secured debentures
These are normally secured by a charge on the companyâ€™s assets, either by a provision to that
effect in the debenture itself, or by the terms of the trust deed drawn up in connection with
the issue. Sometimes a provision appears in both documents.
Registered debentures
These are recorded in the register of debenture holders. Such debentures are transferable
in accordance with the provisions of the terms of issue, but transfer is usually effected by an
instrument in writing in a way similar to that of shares. The transferee of a debenture takes it
subject to equities, and this includes claims which the company has against the transferor. However, the companyâ€™s claims are normally excluded by the terms of issue of the debentures,
these terms usually stating that the money secured by the debentures will be paid without
regard to any equities between the company and previous holders.
Re Goy & Co Ltd, Farmerv Goy & Co Ltd[1900] 2 Ch 149
In a voluntary winding-up of the company WH Doggett had been appointed liquidator and also
receiver. At this point, Chandler, a former director, transferred Â£600 of debentures to GD Robey by
way of security for a loan. The conditions of the debentures provided that on complying with certain formalities, the principal and interest secured by the debentures would be paid without regard
to any equities between the company and the original or intermediate holder. After Robey had
taken the transfer, it was discovered that Chandler had been guilty of misfeasance and he was
ordered by the court to pay Â£300 to the liquidator. Robey, who had no notice of this cross-claim,
sent his transfer to the liquidator, for registration. The liquidator declined to register it, and claimed
the right to deduct the Â£300 owed by Chandler.
Held- by the High Court - the right to transfer and have the transfer registered was not affected
by the winding-up or by the court order against Chandler, and Robey was entitled to have the
debentures registered without deduction.
It should also be noted that when a company sets up a register of debenture holders,
the CA 2006, ss 743-748 provisions relating to no notice of trust do not apply to it, and the
company would be bound by any notice of trust or other equity over the debentures. It is,
therefore, usual to provide in the terms of issue that the company shall not be bound to
recognise anyone other than the registered holder.
Redeemable debentures
Debentures are usually redeemable, and the company may provide a fund for their redemption. The annual amount so provided must be charged whether profits are made or not,

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
though in some cases the terms of issue may stipulate that the fund shall be provided only out
of profits, if made.
Debentures may be redeemed in the following ways:
(a) By drawings by lot, either at the companyâ€™s option or at fixed intervals.
(b) By the company buying them in the market, and if the debentures are bought in the
market at a discount, the consequent profit to the company is a realised profit available
for dividend unless the articles otherwise provide.
(c) By the company redeeming them either out of a fund or possibly by a fresh issue of debentures. A fresh issue is useful to the company where rates of interest have fallen, because
the old debentures can be redeemed and the money reborrowed by the fresh issue at
lower rates of interest. Where redemption is by a fresh issue, it is usual to allow the existing debenture holders to exchange the old debentures for the new ones if they so wish.
The company will redeem at a fixed future date, but usually has an option to redeem on or
after a given earlier date, and this allows the company to choose the most convenient time for
redemption.
Redemption may be at the issue price or at a higher price, and debentures may be issued
at (say) 80 and redeemed at 100, or issued at 100 and redeemed at 110, thus giving the debenture holders a capital gain in addition to the interest payments made.
CA 2006, s 752 allows the company to reissue debentures which it has redeemed unless the
company has resolved that the debentures shall not be reissued, or unless there are provisions
in the articles or terms of issue of the original debentures that they shall not be reissued.
A person to whom debentures are reissued has the same priorities as had the original debenture holder.
The articles and/or the trust deed under which the debentures are issued invariably forbid
reissue, and if there was a reissue in that situation the purchasers of the reissued debentures
would be deferred to other persons holding debentures at that time.
Where a company has issued debentures to secure advances made from time to time on a
current account such as a bank overdraft, the debenture shall not be considered redeemed by
reason only of the account ceasing to be at a certain point in debit so long as the debentures
are still deposited with the person making the advances. They are a valid security for fresh
Unsecured debentures
Such a debenture is no more than an unsecured promise by the company to repay the
loan. The holder can, of course, sue the company on that promise, but is only an ordinary
creditor in a winding-up, although, since he is a creditor, he can petition the court for a
winding-up.
Bearer debentures
These are negotiable instruments and are transferable free from equities by mere delivery and
it is not necessary to give the company notice of transfer.

Acquisition of debentures
Interest is paid by means of coupons attached to the debenture, these coupons being in
effect an instruction to the companyâ€™s banker to pay the bearer of the coupon a stated sum on
presentment to the bank after a certain date. The company can communicate with the holders
of bearer debentures only by advertisement, and it is often provided that the holders of
such debentures may exchange them for registered debentures.
Irredeemable debentures
A debenture which is issued with no fixed date of redemption is an irredeemable debenture,
though such debentures are redeemable on a winding-up, and the liquidator is empowered to
discharge them. In addition, irredeemable debentures always empower the debenture holders
to enforce their security should the company, for example, fail to pay interest on the loan and
such enforcement will result in the payment of the debenture debt. CA 2006, s 735 provides
that such debentures may be issued, and this provision is necessary because otherwise the
general rule of equity, that redemption of a mortgage cannot be postponed for too long a
time, would apply. The result is that a company can create long mortgages over its land and
other property by means of debentures, whether irredeemable or for a long contractual period
prior to redemption.
Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltdv Byrne[1940] AC 613
The claimants owned a large freehold estate close to Knightsbridge. This estate was mortgaged
to a Friendly Society for a sum of money which, together with interest, was to be repaid over a
period of 40 years in 80 half-yearly instalments. The company wished to redeem the mortgage
before the expiration of the term, because it was possible for it to borrow elsewhere at a lower rate
of interest.
Held- by the House of Lords - the company was not entitled to redeem the mortgage before the
end of the 40 years because the effect of what is now the Companies Act 1985 was to remove the
application of the equitable doctrine of no postponement of the right of redemption from mortgages given by compani es. Therefore, Knightsbridge was not entitled to redeem the mortgage
except by the half-yearly instalments as agreed.
A debenture with no fixed date for redemption, but which gives the company the right
to repay it at its option, is properly called a perpetual and not an irredeemable debenture
(CA 2006, s 739).
Acquisition of debentures
Debentures may be acquired either from the company itself or by transfer or transmission.
Issue by the company
A company may issue debentures either individually or in a series. The provisions of the Companies Act 2006 forbidding the allotment of shares at a discount do not apply to debentures,

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
and accordingly they may be allotted at par, at a discount, or at a premium, unless this is
forbidden by the companyâ€™s articles. However, if debentures are issued at a discount together
with a right to exchange them for shares at par value, the debentures are good but the right to
exchange is void (Moselyv Koffyfontein Mines Ltd[1904] 2 Ch 108). The share premium provisions do not apply to an issue of debentures and so if they are issued at a premium there is
no need to open the equivalent of a share premium account.
If a person agrees to take a debenture from the company in return for a loan, the contract
may be enforced by both the lender and the company by specific performance. CA 2006, s 740
gives this right because, in the absence of such statutory provision, equity would not specifically enforce a loan.
A private company cannot offer securities including debentures to the public.
The company must have certificates ready within two months after allotment or transfer,
unless the terms of issue otherwise provide. (But note the position on transfer through the
âž¨ See p. 243 Stock Exchange system - see Chapter 12 âž¨.)
Registered debentures are transferable in accordance with the method laid down in the terms
of issue, usually a stock transfer form as for shares. The company cannot refuse to register a
properly stamped transfer, provided the terms of issue allow transfers and contain no restrictions, but a proper instrument of transfer must be produced to the company except, for
example, in cases of transmission. Where the company refuses to register a transfer, it must
send a notice to this effect to the transferee within two months of the transfer being lodged.
Certification by the company of an instrument of transfer has the same effect in the case of
debentures as it has in the case of shares, i.e. it is a representation that documents have been
produced to the company which show a prima facie title in the transferors.
In the case of bearer debentures, transfer is by mere delivery and the company is not
Transmission
As in the case of shares, debentures pass by operation of law (a) to the holderâ€™s personal
representatives on death, and (b) to the holderâ€™s trustee on bankruptcy, and the rights of such
âž¨ See p. 243 persons are similar to their rights when shares pass by operation of law (see Chapter 12 âž¨).
The trust deed
When debentures are offered for public subscription, the company enters into a trust deed
with trustees, being a trust corporation such as an insurance company. The charge securing
the debentures is made in favour of the trustees who hold it on trust for the debenture stock
holders. The trustees are usually appointed and paid by the company to act on behalf of the
debenture stock holders.
Debenture stock holders, unlike debenture holders, are not creditors of the company.
Thus, in Re Dunderland Iron Ore Co Ltd[1909] 1 Ch 446 it was held that the holder of debenture stock secured by a trust deed could not present a petition to wind up the company since

The trust deed
he was not a creditor. The trustees are the creditors for the whole debenture debt, and the
stockholder is an equitable beneficiary of the trust on which they hold that debt. Consequently, his remedies are against the trustees, but by suing them, on behalf of himself and
the other debenture holders, to compel them to exercise their remedies against the company,
he can indirectly enforce the same remedies against the company as the holder of a single
debenture can enforce directly.
The creation of a trust deed has the following advantages:
(a) It enables a legal or equitable mortgage on specific assets of the company to be created. The
deeds of property can be held by the trustees, and where there is a legal mortgage the legal
estate can be vested in them. It could not be vested in hundreds or possibly thousands of
debenture holders because, since the property legislation of 1925, the legal estate in land
cannot be vested in more than four persons.
(b) There is also the matter of priorities. A mortgage, in general terms, ranks in the order of its
creation, so without a trust deed, in an issue to the public, the holder of the first certificate
to be issued would rank in front of the second and so on. Holder number one would be
entitled to payment from the companyâ€™s assets in fullbefore the second certificate holder
got anything. Certificate holder, say, 1,000 might get nothing if the companyâ€™s assets were
insufficient. Under the trust deed the trustees have the charge and can, for example, sell
the companyâ€™s assets and distribute the proceeds equally so that all the stockholders get
the same amount even if it is not a payment in full. Distribution is pari passu, which is a
term commonly used of this procedure.
(c) The interests of the debenture holders are better safeguardedby the employment of a professional trust corporation, or by a small number of expert trustees, than they would be
if left to the debenture holders themselves. The latter are often widely dispersed and often
lack the knowledge required to safeguard their interests properly.
Trustees usually have the power to call meetings of the debenture holders to inform
them of matters of particular concern to them.
(d) The trust deed usually gives the trustees power to sell the property chargedwithout the aid of
the court, and to appoint an administrative receiver should the company default, for
example, in the payment of interest or repayment of the principal sums borrowed.
(e) The trust deed usually gives the trustees power to see that the security is properly maintained
and repaired and insured.
Where debentures are issued under a trust deed, the debentures themselves refer to the
deed and thereby incorporate its terms.
Contents of the trust deed
The main clauses of a trust deed are as follows:
(a) The nature of the security. Details of the assets charged are given, and it sets out the powers
of the trustees to deal with them on default by the company and on a winding-up.
(b) The nature of the charge. The deed will state whether the charge is a fixed or a floating
charge. Usually there is a combination of both, i.e. a fixed charge on certain of the companyâ€™s assets and a floating charge on the rest. There will also be a provision relating
to the companyâ€™s power to create other charges ranking equally with, or in priority to, the
present charge.

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
(c) The kind of debentures to be issued. This clause will state whether the debentures are to be
registered or bearer, or whether debenture stock is to be issued; and if stock, the minimum amount which can be transferred.
(d) The method of redemption. The clause will state whether there is to be an ordinary
redemption by the company, or whether redemption is to be made by drawings or in the
market, and when the redemption is to take place. This clause will also give details of any
fund which the company proposes to set up to provide for the redemption of the debentures.
A copy of any trust deed for securing any issue of debentures must be forwarded to every
holder of any such debentures on payment of a fee.
The Act prevents a trust deed from exempting the trustees from liability for breach of trust
on grounds of negligence. It can, however, permit subsequent release from such liability by a
majority of not less than three-quarters in value of the debenture holders present and voting
at a meeting summoned for the purpose.
Company charges
Part 25, CA 2006, ss 860-894 covers company charges.
Debentures may be secured by a fixed or by a floating charge, or by a combination of both
types of charge. The expression â€˜mortgage debentureâ€™ normally denotes a debenture secured
by a fixed charge.
Fixed (or specific) charge
Such a charge usually takes the form of a legal mortgage over specified assets of the company,
e.g. its land and buildings and fixed plant. The mortgage is usually created by a charge by deed
expressed to be by way of legal mortgage under s 85(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925. The
major disadvantage from the companyâ€™s point of view is that it cannot dispose of the asset or
assets subject to the charge without the consent of the debenture holder. However, there is a
major advantage for the directors in a fixed charge because they will almost always have personally guaranteed the companyâ€™s overdraft, and in an insolvency it is important to them that
the bank gets as much as possible from the debenture securing the overdraft so that their
liability is extinguished or reduced. In this connection it is worth noting that a fixed charge
is not postponed to preferential creditors and other creditors as is a floating charge, and the
bank will get more from the security on realisation. This will not apply if the fixed charge is,
by agreement between lenders, to rank behind a floating charge, in which case the second
ranking fixed charge is subject to the floating charge and ranks after it and the claims of the
preferential debts, e.g. wages and salaries, upon it (see Re Portbase (Clothing) Ltd, Mond v
Taylor[1993] 3 All ER 829).
Where the company has no land, buildings or fixed plant, a bank can be asked to take a
fixed charge over book debts.
The words used by the parties are not conclusive. If the court finds on the facts that the
charge is a floating charge, it will not be persuaded that the charge is a fixed charge merely
because the parties have said that it is (Re ASRS Establishment Ltd [1999] The Times,
17 November).

Company charges
Floating charge
This is a charge which is not attached to any particular asset(s) identified when the charge
is made. Instead it attaches to the companyâ€™s assets as they then are, if and when the charge
crystallises. The company is in the meantime free to dispose of its assets, and any new assets
which the company may acquire are available to the debenture holder should the charge
crystallise. Because such a charge does not fix at the time of its creation upon any particular
asset it is equitable by nature, and this is relevant when considering the question of priority of
charges when more than one has been created over the assets of the company.
Fixed charges over book debts
The advantage to the directors, and to the bank as debenture holder, of such a charge has
already been considered. However, since a charge over book debts is over after-acquired
property, the legal position was not absolutely settled, though it had been held in England that
such a charge was valid (see Siebe Gorman & Co Ltdv Barclays Bank Ltd[1979] 2 Lloydâ€™s Rep
142), and this decision was affirmed by the Irish Supreme Court in Re Keenan Bros Ltd[1985]
1 RLM 641, and again by the English Court of Appeal in Re New Bullas Trading Ltd[1994]
1 BCLC 485.
There are procedures to be set up by the bank in order to safeguard its position as a fixed
charge holder but these are not considered here because they are a matter for the bankâ€™s legal
advisers. Those advising the company can only suggest the fixed charge and point out to the
directors its advantage to them in terms of their guarantees to the bank.
It is, however, of interest to note that the High Court has held that the terms of a debenture which contained provisions for a lending bank to have control of the borrowing companyâ€™s book debts and other debts over which it had taken a specific charge, were essential to
protect the validity of such a charge. Although the terms restricted the companyâ€™s commercial use of its book and other debts, they were not anti-competitive, nor contrary to Arts 81
and 82 of the Treaty of Rome (Oakdale (Richmond) Ltd v National Westminster Bank plc
[1997] 1 BCLC 63).
A major difficulty arose in connection with fixed charges over book debts following the
ruling of the Privy Council in Agnewv Inland Revenue[2001] All ER (D) 21 (the Brumark
This ruling came out of an appeal from New Zealand and represented the usual sort of
challenge to the fixed charge. If it is a fixed charge it will, as we have noted, rank before the
preferential creditors. HMRC (formerly Inland Revenue) is now no longer a preferential creditor but ranks with the unsecured trade creditors but the Revenue often tried to attack the
fixed charge over book debts hoping that it would be regarded as a floating charge which is
postponed to preferential creditors.
The difficulty with Brumark was that the Privy Council ruled that the lender must have
systems in place to exercise control over the book debts both collected and uncollected. In
Brumarkthe charge left the company free to collect and use the book debts in the ordinary
course of its business. This in the view of the Privy Council made the charge floating not fixed
by reason of the lenderâ€™s lack of sufficient control.
The Brumarkdecision was of course only persuasive as are decisions of the Privy Council
but it added a new strand worrying to business because businessmen and women had always
understood that if a debenture took a fixed charge over book debts under what was known

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
as the Siebe Gorman formula the court would treat it as a fixed charge. The Siebe Gorman
charge merely:
â— prohibits the borrower from disposing (as by sale) of its book debts before collection; and
â— requires the proceeds of the book debts to be paid into an account with the lending bank.
It does not prevent use of the proceeds by the company in its business.
In the latest case in the saga, In Re Spectrum Plus Ltd (in Liquidation)[2004] NLJR 890,
the Court of Appeal refused to follow Brumark and restored the Siebe Gorman formula to
validity. However, in June 2005, the House of Lords allowed the appeal, holding that it was
possible to create a fixed charge over book debts. The essential characteristic of a floating
charge is that the asset subject to the charge is not finally appropriated as a security for the
payment of the debt until the occurrence of some future event. In the meantime, the chargor
is left free to use the charged asset and to remove it from the security, Brumark Investments
Ltd, Reapplied. Where the chargor remains free to remove the charged assets from the security, the charge should, in principle, be categorised as a floating charge. It was not possible to
create a charge on book debts which was fixed while they were uncollected but floating in
respect of the proceeds when collected, Re New Bullas Trading Ltdoverruled. The House of
Lords went on to overrule the decision in Siebe Gorman.
Crystallisation of floating charges
A floating charge crystallises:
(a) In the circumstances specified in the debenture. This means that crystallisation can take
place by agreement between the parties and the particular debenture must be looked at.
However, most usually where the loan is repayable on demand, as in the case of an overdraft, the charge will crystallise automatically when the bank calls in the overdraft which
the company cannot pay. The bank may then appoint an administrative receiver. However, the High Court has decided that where a bank has lent a company money that is
repayable on demand with a security over the companyâ€™s assets, the timing of the bankâ€™s
appointment of an administrative receiver is governed, where the company has the means
to repay by the time it needs to set the mechanics of repayment in motion. If the company has made it clear that it cannot pay, the bank may make the appointment straightaway as could any other secured creditor (see Sheppard and Cooper Ltdv TSB Bank plc
[1996] 2 All ER 654). Other circumstances specified include failure of the company to
pay interest or the principal sum when due as agreed. These may also result in automatic
crystallisation. In some cases the charge may be stipulated to crystallise when the company exceeds a specified borrowing limit.
(b) Automatic crystallisation occurs on the appointment of a receiver under a fixed charge or
an administrative receiver under a fixed/floating charge, or if the company commences
to wind up and on cessation of its business (Re Woodroffes (Musical Instruments)[1985]
2 All ER 908).
Once a floating charge crystallises, the assets subject to the charge pass into the eventual
control of the receiver and pass out of the control of the company immediately. Any disposition of those assets by the company after the charge crystallises means that the purchaser from

Postponement of floating charges
the company takes the assets subject to the charge, i.e. the right of the debenture holder to
proceed against them to satisfy the debt.
Note: The appointment of administrative receivers is now much restricted.
Postponement of floating charges
A person who lends money on the security of a fixed charge over the companyâ€™s property is
always entitled to repayment of his loan from the proceeds of sale of the mortgaged property
before any other creditor, except a creditor with a prior fixed charge. A person who takes a
floating charge is not so secure. There are cases in which his receiver will have to yield priority to other classes of creditors. The detailed law in this area is not considered because it is
relevant only in an insolvency and is therefore more within the specialist province of the
insolvency practitioner. It is not likely to be examined in detail in a general paper on company law. However, an outline of the position is given below.
Preferential creditors
Once a floating charge has crystallised the owner of the charge, e.g. the bank, is entitled to
repayment of the loan out of the assets to which the charge has attached before the companyâ€™s
unsecured creditors. However, there is one statutory exception to this, which is that when a
floating charge crystallises the claims which would be preferential in a winding-up rank in
front of the debenture holder in respect of realisation of assets under the floating charge.
The debenture debt is postponed only to preferential payments accrued at the date of the
appointment of an administrator and not to those which accrue subsequently. Schedule 6 of
the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 applies, and there are no
provisions for payment of interest on these debts until payment. Schedule 6 should be
referred to if necessary for further detail, but the main preferential debts are as follows:
(a) Wages or salaries of employees due within four months before the relevant date, up to a
maximum of Â£800 for each employee. The fees of non-executive directors are not preferential, though executive directors will normally be regarded as employees (see further
âž¨ See p. 289 Chapter 15 âž¨) to the extent of the remuneration paid to them in respect of their duties
as executives, except where they are also controlling shareholders (see e.g. Buchan v
Secretary of State for Employment (1997) 565 IRLB 2). A practice has developed of
regarding the Â£800 as a gross sum, thus reducing the amount payable to the relevant
preferential creditor. The legislation does not specify net or gross.
(b) All accrued holiday remuneration of employees.
(c) Unpaid pension contributions.
It should be noted that if a bank has provided funds to pay wages and salaries before the
administration that debt becomes preferential under the rule of subrogation. The justification
for the subrogation principle which is contained in Sch 6, para 11 to the 1986 Act is that the
protection it offers to banks and other lenders may encourage them to advance further money
for the payment of wages at a critical time in the debtor companyâ€™s affairs so as to enable it to
continue trading and possibly avoid insolvency leading to the appointment of an administrator or liquidator.

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
The main advantage of being a secured or preferential creditor in an administration
(administrative receiverships being largely abolished under Enterprise Act 2002 amendments
to the Insolvency Act 1986) is that the administratorâ€™s proposals for achieving the purposes
of the administration must preserve the rights of the preferential creditors to prior payment
of their debts. The priority of secured creditors such as floating chargeholders in terms of
payment must also be preserved though in this case payment is subject to a ring-fenced fund
for payment of unsecured creditors of a percentage that shall not be distributed to floating
chargeholders. These matters are further considered in the chapters on corporate insolvency.
Protection of employees
Under ss 167-170 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended), an employee who loses
his job when his employer becomes insolvent can claim through the National Insurance Fund
certain payments which are owed to him rather than relying on the preferential payments
procedure. The administrative receiver will normally calculate what is due and obtain authorisation through the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In so far as any part of
this payment is preferential, the rights and remedies of the employee concerned are transferred to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which becomes preferential in
respect of them. Major debts covered are:
(a) arrears of pay for a period not exceeding eight weeks up to a maximum of Â£350 per week;
(b) pay in respect of holidays taken and accrued holiday pay up to Â£350 per week up to a limit
of six weeks in the last 12 months of employment;
(c) payments in lieu of notice at a rate not exceeding Â£350 per week up to the statutory
minimum entitlement of a particular employee under the Employment Rights Act 1996;
(d) any payment outstanding in regard to an award by an employment tribunal of compensation for unfair dismissal, limited to the amount of the basic award;
(e) reimbursement of the whole or part of any fee or premium paid by an apprentice or
articled clerk;
(f) certain unpaid contributions to an occupational or a personal pension scheme. The amount
of Â£350 refers throughout to the employeeâ€™s gross wage.
There is a provision in s 167 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 for the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills to make payments relating to redundancy direct to the
employee where the employer is insolvent. The Department will normally claim against the
employer, but such a claim is unsecured and does not concern the receiver in terms of
preferential payments. There is no qualifying period of employment for claimants on the
National Insurance Fund, though, of course, certain periods of employment will have been
necessary before an award for unfair dismissal and redundancy would be made.
The Employment Appeal Tribunal has decided that in the above situation the statutory
insolvency provisions apply including the right to set-off. Thus if the employee owes money
to the employer, this must be set off against the payment and only the balance paid to the
employee (see Secretary of State for Employmentv Wilson(1996) 550 IRLB 5 - decided when
the Employment Secretary was responsible for these payments).
Employees working outside the UK: who pays?
Where within the EU an employee works in the UK for an Irish company which is wound up
in Ireland, the BIS is responsible for the insolvency payments described above (see Eversonv

Postponement of floating charges
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry[2000] All ER (EC) 29). The case is to the effect that
the country in which the claimant works is the payee. This may depend, however, on the
number of employees employed in the country alleged to be liable to pay. Where there is only
an insignificant number of employees, the country in which the employing company is being
wound up may be liable instead (see the Danmarks/Bosbaek Case [1998] All ER (EC) 112
where only one employee was involved). In Everson the Irish company had a registered
branch at Avonmouth employing over 200 people. The above rulings are from the European
Court, UK law being silent on the matter.
Retention of title clauses
These clauses have as their purpose the retention of the sellerâ€™s ownership in goods supplied
until the buyer has paid for them, even though the buyer is given possession of the goods and
may resell them or use them in the manufacture of other goods which will be resold. These
clauses may also extend to the proceeds of sale.
If the clause is valid and if the purchasing company goes into an administrative receivership (where this is still possible) or liquidation, then the seller may try to recover the goods
which the purchasing company still has in stock, and sometimes even the proceeds of resale
by the purchasing company, on the basis that the purchaser is a mere baileeof the goods and
not the owner, the seller being the owner and bailor.
In an administration, a valid retention clause is subject to a stay on creditorsâ€™ remedies
under Insolvency Act 1986, Sch B1 so the creditorsâ€™ rights under the clause cannot generally
be enforced and the administrator may dispose of the retained property free of the proprietory interest of creditors with the consent of the court.
The Romalpacase
The decision in Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BVv Romalpa Aluminium[1976] 2 All ER 552
was the first UK decision to alert the accountancy and legal professions to the problems which
these clauses might cause in insolvency practice. The claimants in that case were successful in
recovering aluminium foil supplied under a retention clause, together with the proceeds of
resale of the foil which the clause also covered.
It should be noted, however, that any interest which the seller may claim in the proceeds
of resale will, in view of more recent case law, be regarded by the courts as a charge on book
debts which will be void under CA 2006, ss 860 et seqif not registered at Companies House.
The relevant authorities are Modelboard Ltdv Outer Box Ltd (in Liquidation)[1993] BCLC
623 and Compaq Computers Ltdv Abercorn Group Ltd (t/a Osiris)[1993] BCLC 603.
It does not matter what the sellerâ€™s retention clause says, e.g. proceeds to be held â€˜on trustâ€™,
the buyer acts as â€˜agentâ€™ of the seller, and so on. The courts have in recent times looked beyond
the language to the reality and regarded the relationship as that of debtor (buyer) and creditor (seller), which is not an equitable fiduciary relationship, so that the equitable remedy
of tracing is not available and recovery of the proceeds of sale is not possible without the
creation and registration of a charge over what are, in effect, book debts. Those in equitable
relationships, such as trustee and beneficiary, can trace trust property without the need
for registration.
The recovery of the proceeds in Romalpahas been looked on in more recent times as not
significant since the receiver in that case conceded the proceeds and did not contest their
recovery, so the court did not have to rule on the matter.

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
Subsequent cases
Since the decision in the Romalpacase the courts have, broadly speaking, had to deal with two
main types of actions, as follows:
(i) Those cases where the supplier has been solely concerned to implement that part of his
retention clause to retain title over goods supplied under a contract of sale where the
goods have not been changed or added to in a process of manufacture, as was the situation in Romalpa. These actions will probably succeed and insolvency practitioners will
normally release the stock to the supplier provided the goods can be identified with
invoices unpaid. Otherwise, the insolvency practitioner faces an action in conversion by
the supplier. However, should the insolvency practitioner believe that either the clause
has not been properly communicated and is therefore not part of the contract of sale (see
below), or that the goods have not been properly identified, he cannot be prevented from
selling them as part of the realisation of assets. It is clear from the decision of the House
of Lords in American Cyanamid Cov Ethicon[1975] AC 396 that an application for an
injunction to prevent sale will fail because the supplier has an alternative claim for damages in conversion, if his contention that the retention clause is enforceable is correct.
(ii) Those cases in which the supplier is trying to use a retention clause to cover goods supplied to be used in manufacture, as in Borden (UK) Ltdv Scottish Timber Products Ltd
[1979] 3 All ER 961 (sellerâ€™s resin used in making chipboard and mixed with the companyâ€™s material). In these cases the supplier may well have difficulty in recovering even
those goods in stock and not yet used by the purchaser in the manufacturing process,
because it is difficult to construe a bailment where the purchaser can use the goods in
manufacture. This must give the company some sort of ownership of them. Without the
relationship of bailment, there can be no recovery of the goods.
Where the goods have been mixed with the purchaserâ€™s goods, or where the purchaserâ€™s
workforce has added value by skill and effort, the clause will not work unless the retention clause
is registered at Companies House as a charge over the purchasing companyâ€™s assets. Such a charge
is in fact registrable under the Companies Acts. An example is provided by Re Peachdart Ltd
[1983] 3 All ER 204, where the sellerâ€™s leather was converted into handbags by the skill of the
purchaserâ€™s workforce and the purchaser supplied handles and other decoration. The stock of
leather was not recoverable, nor were the finished handbags or work in progress, even though
the retention clause purported to extend to finished products and work in progress.
Other points to be borne in mind regarding retention clauses are:
(a) the need to ensure that the clause has become part of the contract of sale. It is not enough
to include the clause on an invoice, because the contract has already been made by the
time the invoice is issued and new terms cannot be introduced unless there have been
previous dealings, including retention clauses, which can be incorporated;
(b) the need to identify the goods which it is sought to recover. Where goods have been supplied over a period of time it is essential to be able, for example, by serial numbers on the
goods and unpaid invoices, to identify which goods have not been paid for.
Fixed charges
A fixed charge, whether legal or equitable and whenever created, takes priority over the
equitable floating charge on the asset(s) concerned. The only exception is where the floating
charge expressly prohibits the creation of charges in priority to the floating charge (called

Postponement of floating charges
a negative pledge clause) and the person taking the fixed charge knew this to be so. At the
present time this has to be actual knowledge, because registration of the charge at Companies
House gives only constructive notice of the charge but not its particulars (see Wilson v
Kelland[1910] 2 Ch 306). However, ss 860-877 of the CA 2006 provide that registration of
the charge gives constructive notice also of its contents or particulars. The effect would be that
the negative pledge clause would be constructively communicated and Wilsonoverruled.
There may be agreement between lenders that a particular floating charge shall rank in
front of a particular fixed charge. Where this is so the first ranking floating charge remains
subject to preferential debts and the second ranking fixed charge is subject to the prior ranking floating charge and the calls of the preferential debts on it (Re Portbase (Clothing) Ltd,
Mondv Taylor[1993] 3 All ER 829).
Other floating charges
If a company is to have power to create a second floating charge over its undertaking ranking
before the first, the debenture securing the first charge must so provide. Otherwise floating
charges rank for priority in the order in which they were created.
In this connection, it is worth noting that in H & K Medway Ltd, Mackay v IRC [1997]
2 All ER 321 the High Court decided that if a company grants two floating charges over its
assets in favour of two different debenture holders and the second ranking debenture holder
appoints a receiver first, the preferential creditors of the first ranking debenture holder are
entitled to be paid before the first ranking debenture holder even though that debenture
holder is not the person appointing the receiver.
Garnishee orders (now called third-party debt claims for
procedural purposes)
A garnishee order nisimay be issued on behalf of a judgment creditor as a method of enforcing judgment. It may attach to debts owed to the judgment debtor by others. Service of a garnishee order nisi operates as an equitable charge on the debt preventing the debt from being
paid to anybody except the judgment creditor. However, the judgment debtorâ€™s funds in the
hands of a third party, e.g. a bank, cannot in law be actually paid over to the judgment creditor until the garnishee order is made absolute. Between order nisi and absolute the judgment
debtor may bring evidence to the court as to why the funds should not be paid over to the
judgment creditor, which will normally be difficult since the creditor has gone to judgment.
If the funds are paid over while the order has not been made absolute, the third party, e.g.
a bank, must replace the funds of the judgment debtor even though a debt of the judgment
debtor has, in effect, been paid because the bank has no authority to make the payment (see
Crantrave Ltd (in Liquidation)v Lloyds Bank plc[2000] 3 WLR 877, CA where a liquidator
recovered a sum of money paid by the companyâ€™s bankers to the judgment creditor at a time
when the relevant garnishee order was not absolute).
Other postponements
Judgment creditors may, in certain circumstances, be able to retain the proceeds of sale of the
companyâ€™s goods taken in execution by bailiffs. Finance companies may be able to recover
goods which the company has taken on hire-purchase.

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
However, in the case of an administration which will be the normal insolvency procedure
followed by holders of floating charges now that administrative receivership is restricted to
special cases that will be considered in the chapters on corporate insolvency, a moratorium
prevents execution by judgment creditors who have not actually taken property and sold it
through the bailiff system. A finance company would be prevented by the moratorium from
recovering goods on hire-purchase and the administrator can ask the court for an order to sell
the goods provided the proceeds are applied to paying the sums payable under the hirepurchase agreement plus any additional sum to make the proceeds up to market value where
the sale has been below market value. This is to assist the administrator to rescue the company by selling it as a going concern without having to ask permission of owners of goods
such as finance companies to sell them.
As regards landlords who may seek to enforce non-monetary remedies to deal with any
liabilities outstanding under the companyâ€™s lease, para 43(4) of Sch B1 to the Insolvency
Act 1986 prevents a landlord or other person to whom rent is payable from exercising any
right of forfeiture except with the leave of the court or the consent of the administrator.
Validity of charges
Consideration will now be given to how a charge may be made invalid by failure to register
particulars of it, or where it is a floating charge by avoidance under the Insolvency Act 1986
or because the charge is regarded under the same Act as a preference.
Registration of charges
The CA 2006 provides for the registration of certain charges created by companies over their
assets. Accordingly, the se cured debenture given typically to a bank to secure an overdraft
must be registered at Companies House. CA 2006, ss 860 and 861 apply.
Charges to be registered
These are as follows:
1 A charge on land or any interest therein belonging to the company and wherever situate,
other than a charge on rent payable by another in respect of the land.
2 A charge on the companyâ€™s goods where the company is to retain possession of the goods.
If the lender takes possession of the goods, as in a pawn or pledge, or takes a document of
title to them so that the borrower cannot dispose of them effectively, the charge need not
be registered.
3 Charges on the following intangible movable property of the company:
(a) goodwill;
(b) intellectual property - this covers any patent, trade mark, service mark, registered
design, copyright or design right, or any licence under or in respect of any such right.
In the case of a trade mark the charge is ineffective unless the charge is also registered

Registration of charges
at the Trade Mark Registry under s 25 of the Trade Marks Act 1994. This is just as
important as registration at Companies House;
(c) book debts, whether originally owing to the company or assigned to it;
(d) uncalled share capital of a company or calls made but not paid;
(e) charges for securing an issue of debentures;
(f) floating charges on the whole or part of the companyâ€™s property.
It should be noted that (e) and (f) above are â€˜sweep-upâ€™ provisions, and (e) above would
cover an investment company whose only assets were shares and debentures of other companies. Such a company would have to register a charge over those assets to secure a debenture even though the securities which are its assets are not included specifically under other
So far as (f) above is concerned, this would cover a floating charge which was not part of
the issue of a debenture, and so a charge over mixed goods by means of a retention clause
would be registrable under this head.
Contractual liens
The High Court has decided that a contractual possessory lien, i.e. the right to retain anotherâ€™s
property until he has met a debt due in respect of that property coupled with an eventual
right of sale of the relevant property, does not amount to a charge that requires registration
(Re Hamlet International plc: Re Jeffrey Rogers (Imports) Ltd[1998] 95 (16) LSG 24).
Thus, A sells goods to B and takes a contractual possessory lien over the goods until B pays
for them. There is also a power for A to sell the goods if B fails to pay. B goes into administration as in the Hamletcase. The administrator of B claims the goods regarding the lien as a
type of floating charge which is void against the administrator because it is unregistered.
In this case the lien (which is not a charge) is valid since registration is not required of such
an arrangement. A keeps the goods and does not have to deliver them into an insolvent companyâ€™s assets and take the very great risk of receiving payment. If A has delivered the goods
to B, then, of course, the lien being possessory is lost and the administrator may deal with
the goods.
Charges by banks over customer deposits
It was held by the House of Lords in Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA
(No 8)[1997] 4 All ER 568 that a bank could take a charge over its customersâ€™ deposits, thus
doubting and refusing to follow the decision in Re Charge Card Services Ltd[1986] 3 All ER
289 which had regarded this as a â€˜conceptual impossibilityâ€™. The decision was because a
deposit with a bank was a debt owed by the bank to the customer concerned, and as such was
an asset in the customerâ€™s hands which could be charged by him to anyone. The case is of
significance to banks since it extends their options in taking security over third-party deposits.
Banks may be enabled in future to use deposits of subsidiary companies as assets to be set
off against loans made to parent companies. Until this decision, banks have had to rely on
special contractual arrangements which have not always survived the liquidation process.
The decision in BCCI (No 8)raises the question of whether charge-backs should be registered.
The House of Lords left this matter open but given that a charge is void unless registered the
safest course would be to submit the charge for registration as an equitable floating charge.

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
Registration at Companies House
CA 2006, ss 866 and 870 state that it is the duty of the company to deliver particulars of a
charge within 21 days of its creation. CA 2006, s 870 clarifies how the 21-day registration
period is measured:
â— If the charge is created in the UK, with the day after the day on which the charge is created.
â— If the charge is created outside the UK, with the day after the day on which the instrument
by which the charge was created or evidenced (or a copy of it) could, in due course of post
(and if despatched with due diligence), have been received in the UK.
â— If the charge is on property which is acquired by a company, with the day after the day on
which the acquisition is completed.
â— If the charge is on property outside the UK which is acquired by a company and the charge
is created outside the UK, with the day after the day on which the instrument by which the
charge was created or evidenced (or a copy of it) could, in due course of post (and if
despatched with due diligence) have been received in the UK.
CA 2006, s 881 also applies, and in general the date of creation of the charge is when the
instrument involved is signed on behalf of the company. The delivery of particulars can be
made by â€˜any person interested in the chargeâ€™ such as the lender, and the document creating
the charge must also be filed. It is an offence for a company and every officer in default to fail
to deliver particulars of a charge within the specified time.
Re Advantage Healthcare (T10) Ltd[1999] All ER (D) 1294
In this case the High Court held that although in the normal course the applicant for registration of
a charge is required to include correctly the companyâ€™s number, that number is not a particular of
the charge to be registered. Thus failure to give the correct number does not constitute a breach
of s 395 of the 1985 Act and the registration is valid.
The inclusion of the wrong c ompany number, if not detected and changed, does, of course, affect
those who search the register for the chargor. Presumably such cases are rare. The High Court
was appraised of this problem but nevertheless found the charge valid.
The lender will usually take responsibility for the registration process because of the protection it
obtains: firstly because the charge is registered and therefore not void, and secondly because registration establishes priority since charges registered earlier have priority over those registered later.
The Registrar will, under CA 2006, s 885, check the particulars and issue a certificate of
registration which is currently conclusive evidence that the requirements of registration have
been satisfied.
Effect of non-registration
If a charge is not registered as required by the CA 2006, it is void as against a liquidator or
an administrator and any creditor of the company. Thus the holder of the charge becomes
an unsecured creditor on a winding-up. However, the charge is not void against the company
while it is a going concern and can be enforced, for example, by a sale of the assets charged.
Such a sale cannot be set aside in the event that a liquidation takes place afterwards. In

Registration of charges
addition, when the charge becomes void, all sums including any interest payable become
payable immediately on demand.
It will be noted that under the CA 2006 an unregistered charge is not void where exceptionally there is an administrative receivership.
However, the charge is void against a company when it is in administration or liquidation.
Although CA 2006, ss 860 et seq refers to an unregistered charge being void â€˜against the
liquidator or administratorâ€™, this means only that the relevant insolvency practitioner can
employ the assets in the process of liquidation or administration for insolvency purposes. Yet,
if a person holding an unregistered charge removes the property charged then unless the provisions of ss 860 et seqcan be construed as making the charge void also against the company,
a liquidator or administrator cannot sue for damages for conversion in a personal capacity
because the asset is not his. Assets do not vest into the ownership of insolvency practitioners
and ownership is essential in most cases for a successful action in conversion. If the charge is
also void against the company then the insolvency practitioner can bring a claim in conversion on behalf of the company, as the administrator did successfully in Smith (Administrator
of Coslett (Contractors) Ltd)v Bridgend County Borough Council[2001] UKHL 58, [2002] 1
All ER 292 where the House of Lords decided that CA 1985, s 395 must be regarded at least
in an insolvency as making an unregistered charge void also against the company.
Registration out of time
It is necessary to ask the court to allow registration out of time. A usual condition imposed by
the court is that late registration is to be allowed but â€˜without prejudice to the rights of any
parties acquired prior to the time when the charge was registeredâ€™. In effect, then, the charge
ranks for priority from the date of its late registration.
Registration out of time and insolvency
Except in very exceptional circumstances the court will not grant late registration where a liquidation has commenced. The court is also reluctant to give permission where liquidation is
imminent (Re Ashpurton Estates Ltd[1982] 3 All ER 665). However, late registration was allowed
in Barclays Bankv Stuart London Ltd[2001] 2 BCLC 316 where the order provided in effect that
if winding-up commenced before the end of the extension time the liquidator could set it aside
on application to the court thus reducing the holder of the charge to an un-secured creditor.
Releasing the charge: Companies House
Under CA 2006, s 887 and on application being made to him by the company that the charge has
been released or redeemed the Registrar will enter a memorandum of satisfaction on the register.
Releasing the charge: act of parties
A security over property may be released by act of parties. An example is provided by Western
Intelligence Ltdv KDO Label Printing Machines Ltd[1998] BCC 472 where the High Court
held that when goods were transferred with the consent of the bank from a company in
financial difficulties to a new company controlled by the same directors, the goods were
released from a debenture granted by the original company to the bank.

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
Companyâ€™s register
Sections 877 and 892 of the CA 2006 enable a company to keep its instruments creating charges
and mortgages and its register of charges and mortgages in a place other than its registered
office. Section 1136 of CA 2006 gives the Secretary of State power to make provisions by regulations specifying places other than a companyâ€™s registered office at which a companyâ€™s records,
including its registers required to be kept available for inspection, may be kept. The company
must enter in the register a short description of the property charged, the amount of the charge
and the names of the persons entitled to the charge, except in the case of securities to bearer.
The Companies (Company Records) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/3006)specify the inspection
location which may be used as an alternative to the registered office, for those company
records referred to in CA 2006, s 1136(2), which includes instruments creating charges and
mortgages and the register of charges and mortgages. The alternative location is a single
location that is situated in the same part of the UK (for example, England, Wales, Scotland
or Northern Ireland) as the companyâ€™s registered office. This is sufficiently flexible for a company to select an alternative location appropriate to its business.
The Companies (Trading Disclosures) Regulations 2008provide that where a company has
specified an alternative inspection location, it is required to disclose the address of that place
and the type of records kept at that place to any person it deals with in the course of business
who makes a written request for such information. The company is required to send a written response to that person within five working days of receiving the request.
As regards failure to register a charge in the companyâ€™s register, there is a default fine on
any officer of the company who is in default as well as upon the company itself, but the charge
is still valid. In other words, it is only failure to register at Companies House which affects the
validity of the charge.
The company must keep a register of debenture holders but only if the terms of issue of the
debentures require it. The register, if it exists, must be kept at the registered office or the place
where it is made up so long as it is within the country in which the company is registered. The
register may be inspected free of charge by those who are registered holders of debentures
and, in addition, shareholders in the company, and by other persons on payment of a fee.
Members, registered holders of debentures and other persons may acquire a copy of the
register on payment of a fee. The register of directorsâ€™ interests must show their debenture
âž¨ See p. 276 holdings also. This register is dealt with more fully in Chapter 14 âž¨.
Because a power of inspection exists a company must maintain the register even though
there are no entries in it if only to indicate that this is so.
Avoidance of floating charges
Under s 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986, a floating charge created by a company within one
year before the commencement of its winding-up or the making of an administration order
is void as a security for any debt other than cash paid or goods supplied to the company in
consideration of the charge at the time the charge was created or subsequently, with interest,
if any, thereon as agreed. The above provisions do not apply if the company was solvent
immediately after the creation of the charge.

Avoidance of floating charges
It was held in Powerv Sharp Investments Ltd[1993] BCC 609 that no moneys paid to the
company before the execution of the debenture would qualify for the invalidity exemption in
s 245 unless the interval between the payment and execution of the debenture was minimal
and could be regarded as contemporaneous.
If the person in whose favour the charge was created was connected with the company,
âž¨ See p. 334 e.g. a director or shadow director (see further Chapter 17 âž¨), the period is two years, and
the charge is void even though the connected person gave consideration at the time or subsequently, and even though the company was solvent immediately after the charge was given.
The purpose of the section is to prevent a company which is unable to pay its debts from,
in effect, preferring one of its unsecured creditors to the others by giving him a floating charge
on its assets. There is no objection to the creation of a floating charge where the company
actually receives funds or goods at the time or afterwards because these may assist it to carry
on business, and indeed avoid winding-up or administration. The charge only extends to the
value of the funds or goods supplied after it was given and does not secure the existing debt
to the unsecured creditor. As regards goods supplied, the charge extends only to the price
which could reasonably have been obtained for them in the ordinary course of business at
the time when they were supplied. The security would not extend to the whole of the value
of goods supplied at an artificially high price.
Practical points arising
(i) Most importantly, a floating charge is valid as a security for loans made after the date it
was created if the lender promised to make such loans (covenanted loans), and even if
the lender did not (uncovenanted loans) (Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd (1965), see below).
Consequently, advances made to an insolvent company by its bank on an overdraft
facility during the year before it is wound up are validly secured in the winding-up (or
administration if relevant) by a floating charge given before the advances were made.
The debenture creating the charge must expressly cover covenanted and uncovenanted
loans, i.e. agreed loans and other loans not agreed at the time.
Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd[1965] Ch 148
The company was in liquidation and had an overdraft of Â£67,000 with the National Provincial Bank
Ltd. The overdraft was secured by a floating charge given less than 12 months prior to winding-up
at a time when the company was insolvent. The charge was therefore void under what is now
s 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986. However, the company had paid in some Â£111,000 and the bank
had paid cheques out to the amount of some Â£110,000. The Court of Appeal held that under
Claytonâ€™s Case (1816) 1 Mer 572, under which the earliest payments into an account are set off
against the earliest payments out and vice versa, the overdraft, which was not validly secured, had
been paid off and the floating charge attached to the money drawn out because the company had
received consideration for this. It did not matter that the floating charge did not require the bank
to make further advances. It did, however, expressly secure uncovenanted loans.
The Cork Committee said that this case defeated the object of what is now s 245. They thought it
should be repealed by statute so that for the purposes of s 245 payments into the account should
be treated as discharging debit items incurred after the creating of the floating charge before those
incurred before it (see Cmnd 8558, para 1562).

Chapter 22 Debentures and charges
(ii) The period of one (or two) year(s) from the creation of the floating charge is calculated
from the date when the instrument imposing the charge is executed and not from the
date of the issue of the debenture which may be later.
(iii) If an unsecured creditor takes a new loan to the company on the security of a floating
charge on the understanding that the loan will be applied immediately in paying off
his existing unsecured debt, the floating charge will normally be invalid unless the company is solvent immediately after the charge is given (Re Destone Fabrics Ltd[1941] 1 All
(iv) Floating charges are invalidated only if the company is wound up or goes into administration, and so if before either of those events it redeems a floating charge which would
have been invalid in those situations, the liquidator or administrator cannot require the
owner of the charge to repay what he has received (Re Parkes Garage (Swadlincote) Ltd
[1929] 1 Ch 139). However, if the redemption takes place within six months (two years
if the debenture holder is a connected person) before the winding-up or administration
it may be a preference of the debenture holder, in which case the relevant insolvency
practitioner can recover the amount paid to the debenture holder under s 239 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 (see below).
The s 245 avoidance provisions do not apply to fixed charges, but the preference provisions
of s 239 do (see below).
Preference
A liquidator or an administrator may avoid a fixed or floating charge as a preference under
s 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986 if:
(a) in giving the charge the company was influenced by a desire to better the position of
a creditor or surety. Thus, to give a charge to a lender where the directors had personally
guaranteed the loan w ould be a preference (see Re Kushler[1943] 2 All ER 22). However,
the giving of a charge to an unsecured creditor about to levy execution on the companyâ€™s
goods may very well not be, because it would be given to preserve the companyâ€™s assets at
market value, bearing in mind that sheriff sales are often at throwaway prices;
(b) the company was insolvent when the charge was given; and
(c) the charge was given within the six months preceding the commencement of the windingup or administration.
Where the creditor preferred is a connected person, e.g. a director or shadow director, the
time period is two years and (a) above is presumed.
In this connection, the High Court decided in Weisgardv Pilkington[1996] CLY 3488 that
a companyâ€™s transfer by lease of certain of its assets (six flats) to two of its directors before it
went into insolvent liquidation - ostensibly in discharge of a debt the company owed them -
was a preference to connected persons so that the transfer must be reversed and the flats
returned to the company. The directors had not displaced the presumption under s 239 that
the transfers constituted a preference to connected persons. The transfers had put the directors in a better position than they would have been in given an insolvent liquidation. This

BIS consultation
wasso even in regard to two of the flats which were charged to a bank to secure an overdraft
since the charge operated to reduce the directorsâ€™ liabilities as guarantors of that overdraft.
Most recently, in the case of Re Harmony Care Homes Ltd [2010] BCC 358, the joint
administrative receivers of a company applied to the Chancery Division for a direction pursuant to s 35 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as to whether the book debt proceeds collected by
them during the course of the administrative receivership should be subject to fixed charges
to the holders of the debentures, or as subject to floating charges to the preferential creditors
under s 40 of the 1986 Act. It was the judgeâ€™s conclusion from the opening of a designated
account the company could not make and did not make any use of the money paid into the
account without the chargeeâ€™s written instructions to the bank. It thus appeared that all book
debts collected in by the company from the inception of the debenture were subject to the
chargeeâ€™s control and that from the outset, the status of the security over the book debts was
specific and ascertained. Thus there was never a moment from when the company was entitled to remove the charged assets from the security. The effect of the debenture and the
arrangements the parties put in place was to disentitle the company from using the proceeds
of the book debts as a source of its cash flow or for any other purpose. The security granted
in respect of the book debt realisations was a fixed charge.
Remedies of secured debenture holders
Where the debentures are secured on the assets of the company the following main remedies
are available:
(a) the property charged may be sold or leased;
(b) a receiver may be appointed to take possession of the property.
Where the debenture is secured by a fixed charge, these remedies are available under s 101
of the Law of Property Act 1925. However, since a floating charge may not be covered by
s 101 (see Blakerv Herts & Essex Waterworks(1889) 41 Ch D 399 under earlier similar legislation), the remedies are invariably given in the debenture.
After sale of the assets in a receivership any surplus, after paying off the debenture holders
and the cost of realisation and receiversâ€™ costs and charges, belongs to the company.
BIS consultation
In March 2010, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) commenced a consultation exercise on the registration of company charges. The consultation document states
that it makes proposals to revise the current scheme for the registration of company charges
under the Companies Act 2006 based on the 2001 recommendations of the Company Law
Review and the subsequent advice of the Law Commission. They involve possible changes to:
which charges must be registered; how charges may be registered including the introduction
of electronic registration at Companies House; and the consequences of registering and not
registering a registrable charge.

1 Richard is the founder, managing director and controlling shareholder of RST Ltd. For some
years Richard kept the company afloat by making a number of unsecured loans to it. At the last

Accounts and audit

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
In this chapter we shall consider the main underlying principle of company law in regard to
a companyâ€™s accounts, which is to achieve disclosure of a companyâ€™s financial affairs for the
benefit of those who have invested in it and those who do business with it. The purpose of
an audit by independent accountants is to add credibility to the financial statements forming
part of the annual accounts and to ensure that they comply with regulations and give a true
and fair view though small companies may take exemption from audit.
The keeping of accounts, the audit and filing with the Registrar are the price which the
members and directors of a limited company must pay for limited liability. As we have seen,
a freestanding unlimited company does not have to file accounts though its directors have a
âž¨ See p. 2 duty to see that annual accounts are prepared and audited (see further Chapter 1 âž¨).
Only matters of company law have been included. No attempt has been made to give a
comprehensive survey of the subject matter of accounting and auditing. Some of the main
regulations that concern this area:
â— The Companies Act 2006 (Annual Return and Service Addresses) Regulations 2008;
â— The Small Companies and Groups (Accounts and Directorsâ€™ Report) Regulations 2008;
â— The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations
â— The Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008.
Small and medium-sized companies
The Companies Act 2006 has introduced a number of changes into this area, for example in
the form of additional rules relating to the directorsâ€™ remuneration report which is part of the
annual reporting process of the board. It is also worth noting that a number of these additional reporting requirements for public limited companies are to be found in the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) or in the form of rules produced by the Financial
Services Authority (FSA). However, changes have also taken place at the other end of the
spectrum with respect to small and medium-sized companies.
Small companies
A company which qualifies as small is now subject to different reporting regime (the â€˜small
companies regimeâ€™) which is less onerous in terms of what has to be reported and whether it
needs to be verified by audit (s 381). The test as to whether a company qualifies as â€˜smallâ€™ is
outlined in ss 382-384 of the Companies Act 2006.
Section 382(1) states that a company will qualify as small in relation to its first financial
year if it meets the qualifying conditions in that year as outlined in s 382(3), which goes on to
state that a company meets the qualifying conditions in a year if it satisfies two or more of the
following requirements: (i) turnover not more than Â£5.6 million; (ii) balance sheet total not
more than Â£2.8 million; (iii) number of employees not more than 50. Note that the company
does not have to satisfy all three criteria, meeting two will suffice.
Section 382(5) clarifies that the term â€˜balance sheet totalâ€™ means the aggregate of the
amounts shown as assets in the companyâ€™s balance sheet. Section 382(6) goes on to state that
the â€˜number of employeesâ€™ means the average number of persons employed by the company

Small and medium-sized companies
in the year, determined as follows: (a) find for each month in the financial year the number
of persons employed under contracts of service by the company in that month (whether
throughout the month or not); (b) add together the monthly totals; and (c) divide by the
number of months in the financial year.
Section 382(2) sets down that a company will qualify as small in relation to a subsequent
financial year if the qualifying conditions are met in that year and the preceding financial year;
if the qualifying conditions are met in that year and the company qualified as small in relation to the preceding financial year; if the qualifying conditions were met in the preceding
financial year and the company qualified as small in relation to that year. The purpose of these
rather complex rules is to prevent a potentially small company from moving in and out of the
â€˜small companies regimeâ€™ if performance differs year-on-year, thus providing greater flexibility within the system to cater for such changes.
It is also worth noting that s 382(7) states that this test is subject to the requirements of
s 383, which focuses on whether parent companies may qualify as small companies for the
purpose of the CA 2006. Section 383(1) states that a parent company qualifies as a small company in relation to a financial year only if the group headed by it qualifies as a small group,
the test for which is outlined in s 383(3) as follows:
A group qualifies as small in relation to a subsequent financial year of the parent company:
(a) if the qualifying conditions are met in that year and the preceding financial year; (b) if the
qualifying conditions are met in that year and the group qualified as small in relation to the
preceding financial year; (c) if the qualifying conditions were met in the preceding financial
year and the group qualified as small in relation to that year.
Section 383(4) sets down the qualifying conditions for a group to qualify as small and states
that a group must satisfy two or more of the following requirements in a year: (i) aggregate
turnover not more than Â£5.6 million net (or Â£6.72 million gross); (ii) aggregate balance sheet
total not more than Â£2.8 million net (or Â£3.36 million gross); (iii) aggregate number of
employees not more than 50.
Importantly, s 383(6) goes on to clarify the term â€˜netâ€™ with respect to the aggregate figures
for turnover and balance sheet total, stating that it means after any set-offs and other adjustments made to eliminate group transactions: (a) in the case of Companies Act accounts,
in accordance with regulations under s 404; (b) in the case of IAS accounts, in accordance
with international accounting standards. Section 383(6) also notes that â€˜grossâ€™ means without
those set-offs and other adjustments. A company may satisfy any relevant requirement on the
basis of either the net or the gross figure.
Finally, it is necessary to refer to s 384 which sets out those companies which are excluded
from this regime. Section 384(1) states that the regime does not apply to a company that is,
or was at any time within the financial year to which the accounts relate: (a) a public company; (b) a company that (i) is an authorised insurance company, a banking company, an emoney issuer, an ISD investment firm or a UCITS management company; or (ii) carries on
insurance market activity; or (c) a member of an ineligible group (see s 384(2)).
Medium-sized companies
A company which qualifies as medium is also subject to different reporting regime and for
some reason is outlined in ss 465-467 of the Companies Act 2006. The general test as to
whether a company qualifies as â€˜mediumâ€™ is outlined in s 465 which states that a company

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
qualifies as medium-sized in relation to its first financial year if the qualifying conditions
are met in that year (s 465(1)). These qualifying conditions are outlined in s 465(3) which
states that a company meets them in a year in which it satisfies two or more of the following
requirements: (i) turnover not more than Â£22.8 million; (ii) balance sheet total not more than
Â£11.4 million; (iii) number of employees not more than 250.
Section 465(5) clarifies that the term â€˜balance sheet totalâ€™ means the aggregate of the
amounts shown as assets in the companyâ€™s balance sheet. Section 465(6) goes on to state that
the â€˜number of employeesâ€™ means the average number of persons employed by the company
in the year, determined as follows: (a) find for each month in the financial year the number
of persons employed under contracts of service by the company in that month (whether
throughout the month or not); (b) add together the monthly totals; and (c) divide by the
number of months in the financial year.
Section 465(2) sets down that a company will qualify as medium-sized in relation to a
subsequent financial year if the qualifying conditions are met in that year and the preceding
financial year; if the qualifying conditions are met in that year and the company qualified as
medium-sized in relation to the preceding financial year; if the qualifying conditions were
met in the preceding financial year and the company qualified as medium-sized in relation to
that year.
It is worth noting that s 465(7) once again states that this test is subject to the requirements
of s 466, which focuses on whether parent companies may qualify as medium-sized companies for the purpose of the CA 2006.
Finally, it is necessary to refer to s 467 which sets out those companies which are excluded
from the medium-sized company regime. Section 467(1) states that the regime does not apply
to a company that is, or was at any time within the financial year to which the accounts relate:
(a) a public company; (b) a company that: (i) has permission under Part 4 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (c. 8) to carry on a regulated activity; or (ii) carries on insurance market activity; or (c) a member of an ineligible group (s 467(2)).
Accounting reco rds
Under s 386 of the Companies Act 2006, the directors of a company must keep adequate
accounting records sufficient to show and explain the companyâ€™s transactions (s 386(1)) and
to disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time throughout the financial year, the financial
position of the company at that time(s 386(2)). They must also enable the directors to ensure
that any accounts required to be prepared comply with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and the IAS Regulation (s 388(3)(b)).
In addition to this, s 386(3) goes on to state that the records must contain (a) entries from
day to day of all sums of money received and expended with details of transactions; and (b) a
record of assets and liabilities.
Equally, under s 386(4) a company dealing in goods must keep statements of stock held at
the end of the financial year, and of stocktaking from which the year-end statement is made
up and of all goods sold and purchased, other than retail trade transactions, showing goods,
buyers and sellers, so as to allow identification.
Under s 388(1) accounting records must be kept at its registered office or such other place
as the directors think fit, and must be open for inspection by the officers of the company

Annual accounts
at all times. Section 388(4) goes on to note that these records must be kept for six years
(public company) and three years (private company) from the date on which they are made
(s 388(4)(a) and (b)).
As regards statements of work in progress, the Act does not specifically require these to
be kept, on the grounds that many small companies have little or no work in progress and
those for whom it is significant will have to keep statements as part of the general requirement
to keep records sufficient to disclose the financial position of the company and to enable
accounts to be prepared.
Under s 387(1) failure to keep accounting records as required is an offence for which
officers of the company in default are liable. The offence is punishable with a maximum of
two yearsâ€™ imprisonment and/or a fine (s 387(3)). In addition, under s 388(1) if a company
fails to comply with s 388(1) to (3) of the Act, an offence is committed by every officer of the
company who is in default.
Annual accounts
The term â€˜annual accountsâ€™ is commonly used in business and is now in fact an expression
used in company legislation. For legal purposes it can be taken to mean the year end balance
sheet together with the related profit and loss account and directorsâ€™ and auditorsâ€™ reports.
Section 475(1) of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a companyâ€™s annual accounts for a
financial year must be audited in accordance with this Part 16 of the Act unless the company
is exempt from audit under s 477 (small companies), s 480 (dormant companies), or is
exempt from the requirements of Part 16 of the Act under s 482 (non-profit-making companies subject to public sector audit). Section 475(2) goes on to state that a company is not
entitled to any such exemption unless its balance sheet contains a statement by the directors
to that effect. A company is not entitled to exemption under any of the provisions mentioned
above unless its balance sheet contains a statement by the directors to the effect that (a) the
members have not required the company to obtain an audit of its accounts for the year in
question in accordance with s 476; and (b) the directors acknowledge their responsibilities for
complying with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 with respect to accounting
records and the preparation of accounts (s 475(3)).
Accounting reference dates
Sections 390 to 392 outline the companyâ€™s financial year which depends upon the companyâ€™s
â€˜accounting reference periodâ€™ (ARP) and its â€˜accounting reference dateâ€™ (ARD) which is the
date on which the companyâ€™s ARP ends in each calendar year.
Section 390(2) states that a companyâ€™s first financial year begins with the first day of its
first accounting reference period, and ends with the last day of that period or such other
date, not more than seven days before or after the end of that period, as the directors may
determine. Section 390(3) goes on to note that the companyâ€™s subsequent financial years
begin with the day immediately following the end of the companyâ€™s previous financial
year, and end with the last day of its next accounting reference period or such other date,
not more than seven days before or after the end of that period, as the directors may
determine.

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
Section 391 defines in greater detail the ARD of companies incorporated in Great Britain
and divides them between those incorporated before 1 April 1990 and those incorporated on
or after 1 April 1990. Section 391(2) states that the ARD of a company incorporated in Great
Britain before 1 April 1996 is: (a) the date specified by notice to the Registrar in accordance
with s 224(2) of the Companies Act 1985; or (b) failing such notice: (i) in the case of a company incorporated before 1 April 1990, 31 March; and (ii) in the case of a company incorporated on or after 1 April 1990, the last day of the month in which the anniversary of its
incorporation falls. Section 391(4) goes on to note that the ARD a company incorporated in
Great Britain on or after 1 April 1996 and before the commencement of the Companies Act
2006, or after the commencement of this Act, is the last day of the month in which the
anniversary of its incorporation falls.
Section 391(5) goes on to outline that a companyâ€™s first accounting reference period is the
period of more than six months, but not more than 18 months, beginning with the date of its
incorporation and ending with its accounting reference date. Its subsequent accounting reference periods are successive periods of 12 months beginning immediately after the end of the
previous accounting reference period and ending with its accounting reference date (s 391(6)).
However, a company may choose a new ARD for its current, future and previous ARPs
under s 392(1) of the Companies Act 2006 by giving notice to the Registrar specifying a
new ARD. Section 392(2) states that the notice must state whether the current or previous
accounting reference period (a) is to be shortened, so as to come to an end on the first occasion on which the new accounting reference date falls or fell after the beginning of the period;
or (b) is to be extended, so as to come to an end on the second occasion on which that date
falls or fell after the beginning of the period.
It should be noted that s 391(5) places a restriction on this process, stating that an accounting reference period may not be extended so as to exceed 18 months and a notice under this
section is ineffective if the current or previous accounting reference period as extended in
accordance with the notice would exceed that limit. Equally, s 391(4) provides that a notice
under this section may not be given in respect of a previous accounting reference period if the
period for filing accounts and reports for the financial year determined by reference to that
accounting reference period has already expired.
Preparation of accounts: form and content
Directors must prepare accounts for each financial year under s 394 of the Companies Act
2006 and are referred to as the companyâ€™s â€˜individual accountsâ€™. Section 395(1) provides that
a companyâ€™s individual accounts may be prepared: (a) in accordance with s 396 (â€˜Companies
Act individual accountsâ€™); or (b) in accordance with international accounting standards (â€˜IAS
individual accountsâ€™).
Section 395(3) goes on to state that after the first financial year in which the directors of a
company prepare IAS individual accounts (â€˜the first IAS yearâ€™), all subsequent individual
accounts of the company must be prepared in accordance with international accounting
standards unless there is a relevant change of circumstance. There is a relevant change of circumstance if, at any time during or after the first IAS year: (a) the company becomes a subsidiary undertaking of another undertaking that does not prepare IAS individual accounts;
(b) the company ceases to be a company with securities admitted to trading on a regulated
market in an EEA State; or (c) a parent undertaking of the company ceases to be an undertaking with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market in an EEA state (s 395(4)).

Annual accounts
Section 396(1) goes on to provide that Companies Act individual accounts must comprise:
(a) a balance sheet as at the last day of the financial year; and (b) a profit and loss account.
Section 396(2) goes on to state that the accounts must: (a) in the case of the balance sheet,
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company as at the end of the financial
year; and (b) in the case of the profit and loss account, give a true and fair view of the profit
or loss of the company for the financial year. Furthermore, the accounts must comply with
provision made by the Secretary of State by regulations as to: (a) the form and content of the
balance sheet and profit and loss account; and (b) additional information to be provided by
way of notes to the accounts (s 396(3)).
Section 397 of the CA 2006 deals with the requirements for IAS individual accounts and
provides that where the directors of a company prepare IAS individual accounts, they must
state in the notes to the accounts that the accounts have been prepared in accordance with
international accounting standards.
True and fair view
Section 393(1) of the Companies Act 2006 provides that the directors of a company must not
approve accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss (a) in the case of the companyâ€™s individual
accounts, of the company; (b) in the case of the companyâ€™s group accounts, of the undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole, so far as concerns members of the company.
This is an overriding principle and as such, s 396(4) provides that if compliance with the
regulations, and any other provision made by or under the Companies Act as to the matters
to be included in a companyâ€™s individual accounts or in notes to those accounts, would not
be sufficient to give a true and fair view, the necessary additional information must be given
in the accounts or in a note to them. This is repeated under s 404(4) with respect to group
accounts discussed below.
Equally, s 396(5) goes on to state that if, in special circumstances, compliance with any of those
provisions is inconsistent with the requirement to give a true and fair view, the directors must
depart from that provision to the extent necessary to give a true and fair view. Furthermore,
particulars of any such departure, the reasons for it and its effect must be given in a note to
the accounts. Once again, this is repeated in s 404(5) with respect to group accounts.
Notes to the accounts
Section 472(1) provides that information required by Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006 to
be given in notes to a companyâ€™s annual accounts may be contained in the accounts or in a
separate document annexed to the accounts. Section 472(2) goes on to state that references in
Part 15 of the Act to a companyâ€™s annual accounts, or to a balance sheet or profit and loss
account, include notes to the accounts giving information which is required by any provision
of this Act or international accounting standards, and required or allowed by any such provision to be given in a note to company accounts.
Section 411 of the CA 2006 provides that in the case of a company not subject to the small
companies regime, the following information with respect to the employees of the company
must be given in notes to the companyâ€™s annual accounts: (a) the average number of persons
employed by the company in the financial year; and (b) the average number of persons so
employed within each category of persons employed by the company.

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
In addition, s 413(1) states that in the case of a company that does not prepare group
accounts, details of: (a) advances and credits granted by the company to its directors; and (b)
guarantees of any kind entered into by the company on behalf of its directors, must be shown
in the notes to its individual accounts. Section 413(2) goes on to provide that in the case of a
parent company that prepares group accounts, details of: (a) advances and credits granted to
the directors of the parent company, by that company or by any of its subsidiary undertakings; and (b) guarantees of any kind entered into on behalf of the directors of the parent company, by that company or by any of its subsidiary undertakings, must be shown in the notes
to the group accounts.
Approval and signing of accounts
Section 414(1) provides that a companyâ€™s annual accounts must be approved by the board of
directors and signed on behalf of the board by a director of the company. Under s 414(2), the
signature must be on the companyâ€™s balance sheet. Section 414(3) goes on to state that if the
accounts are prepared in accordance with the provisions applicable to companies subject to
the small companies regime, the balance sheet must contain a statement to that effect in a
prominent position above the signature.
Section 414(4) goes on to provide that if annual accounts are approved that do not comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (and, where applicable, of Art 4 of the
IAS Regulation), every director of the company who: (a) knew that they did not comply, or
was reckless as to whether they complied; and (b) failed to take reasonable steps to secure
compliance with those requirements or, as the case may be, to prevent the accounts from
being approved, commits an offence.
Small company accounts
The statutory format for the Companies Act accounts of a small company is simpler than that
outlined above and is set out in the Small Companies and Groups (Accounts and Directorsâ€™
Report) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/409).
Group accounts
If a company has subsidiaries, s 399(2) of the Companies Act 2006 provides that group
accounts showing the state of affairs and profit or loss of the company and the subsidiaries
must be prepared. Section 404 goes on to provide details of the requirements for Companies
Act group accounts, while s 406 deals with IAS groups accounts.
Section 404(1) states that Companies Act group accounts must comprise: (a) a consolidated balance sheet dealing with the state of affairs of the parent company and its subsidiary
undertakings; and (b) a consolidated profit and loss account dealing with the profit or loss of
the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Section 404(2) goes on to provide that
the accounts must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs as at the end of the financial
year, and the profit or loss for the financial year, of the undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole, so far as concerns members of the company.

The directorsâ€™ report
The accounts must comply with provision made by the Secretary of State by regulations
as to: (a) the form and content of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated profit and
loss account; and (b) additional information to be provided by way of notes to the accounts
(s 404(3)).
Section 405(1) provides that where a parent company prepares Companies Act group
accounts, all the subsidiary undertakings of the company must be included in the consolidation, subject to the exceptions outlined in s 405(2) and (3). Section 405(2) notes that a subsidiary undertaking may be excluded from consolidation if its inclusion is not material for the
purpose of giving a true and fair view. Additionally, under s 405(3) a subsidiary undertaking
may be excluded from consolidation where: (a) severe long-term restrictions substantially
hinder the exercise of the rights of the parent company over the assets or management of that
undertaking; or (b) the information necessary for the preparation of group accounts cannot
be obtained without disproportionate expense or undue delay; or (c) the interest of the
parent company is held exclusively with a view to subsequent resale.
Section 407 deals with the consistency of financial reporting within a group, with s 407(1)
providing that the directors of a parent company must secure that the individual accounts of:
(a) the parent company; and (b) each of its subsidiary undertakings, are all prepared using the
same financial reporting framework, except to the extent that in their opinion there are good
reasons for not doing so.
Finally, ss 400-401 of the Companies Act 2006 set out exemptions for companies included
in EEA and non-EEA group accounts of larger companies.
The directorsâ€™ report
The directors are required under s 415(1) to prepare a directorsâ€™ report for each financial year
of the company. Failure to comply with this requirement is an offence committed by every
person who was a director of the company immediately before the end of the period for filing
accounts and reports for the financial year in question, and failed to take all reasonable steps
for securing compliance with that requirement (s 415(4)).
Section 416 goes on to set down the general contents of directorsâ€™ report, with s 416(1)
providing that the directorsâ€™ report for a financial year must state the names of the persons
who, at any time during the financial year, were directors of the company, and the principal
activities of the company in the course of the year. Section 416(3) states that except in the case
of a company subject to the small companies regime, the report must state the amount (if any)
that the directors recommend should be paid by way of dividend.
Furthermore, according to s 417 of the Companies Act 2006, unless the company is subject to the small companiesâ€™ regime, the directorsâ€™ report must contain a business review. The
purpose of the business review, set down in s 417(2), is to inform members of the company
and to help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under s 172 (duty to
promote the success of the company). Section 417(3) provides that the business review must
contain: (a) a fair review of the companyâ€™s business; and (b) a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties facing the company. In this regard, s 714(4) goes on to state that the
review required is a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the development and performance of the companyâ€™s business during the financial year, and the position of the companyâ€™s
business at the end of that year, consistent with the size and complexity of the business.

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
This is extended under s 417(5) for quoted companies which must, to the extent necessary for
an understanding of the development, performance or position of the companyâ€™s business,
(a) the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, performance and
position of the companyâ€™s business; and
(b) information about:
(i) environmental matters (including the impact of the companyâ€™s business on the
environment),
(ii) the companyâ€™s employees, and
(iii) social and community issues, including information about any policies of the company in relation to those matters and the effectiveness of those policies; and
(c) subject to subsection (11), information about persons with whom the company has contractual or other arrangements which are essential to the business of the company.
In addition, s 417(6) provides that the review must, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the companyâ€™s business, include:
(a) analysis using financial key performance indicators, i.e. factors by reference to which the
development, performance or position of the companyâ€™s business can be measured effectively;
and (b) where appropriate, analysis using other key performance indicators, including information relating to environmental matters and employee matters. This provision is relaxed
slightly for companies which qualify as medium-sized. Under s 417(7), the directorsâ€™ report
for the year need not comply with the requirements of s 417(6) so far as they relate to nonfinancial information.
The review must, where appropriate, include references to, and additional explanations of,
amounts included in the companyâ€™s annual accounts (s 417(8)). However, this section does
not require the disclosure of information about impending developments or matters in the
course of negotiation if the disclosure would, in the opinion of the directors, be seriously
prejudicial to the interests of the company (s 417(10)).
Section 418 goes on to provide details of the statement as to disclosure to auditors and
applies to a company unless under s 418(1) it is exempt for the financial year in question from
the requirements of Part 16 as to audit of accounts, and the directors take advantage of that
exemption. Otherwise, according to s 418(2), the directorsâ€™ report must contain a statement
to the effect that, in the case of each of the persons who are directors at the time the report is
approved: (a) so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which
the companyâ€™s auditor is unaware (i.e. information needed by the companyâ€™s auditor in connection with preparing his report); and (b) he has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the companyâ€™s auditor is aware of that information. In order to discharge the
obligations arising under this subsection, a director must show that he has taken all the steps
that he ought to have taken as a director in order to do the things mentioned (i.e. made such
enquiries of his fellow directors and of the companyâ€™s auditors for that purpose, and taken
such other steps (if any) for that purpose, as are required by his duty as a director of the company to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence) (s 418(4)).
Section 418(5) goes on to provide that where a directorsâ€™ report containing the statement
required by this section is approved but the statement is false, every director of the company
who (a) knew that the statement was false, or was reckless as to whether it was false; and (b)
failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the report from being approved, commits an offence.

Publication of accounts and reports
Finally, with respect to the approval and signing of the directorsâ€™ report, s 419(1) states that
it must be approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board by a director
or the secretary of the company. If the report is prepared in accordance with the small companies regime, it must contain a statement to that effect in a prominent position above the
signature (s 419(2)).
Publication of accounts and reports
A company is under a duty to circulate copies of its annual accounts and reports for each
financial year to every member of the company, every holder of the companyâ€™s debentures,
and every person who is entitled to receive notice of general meetings (s 423(1)). Section 426
of the Act though provides that a company may provide a summary financial statement
instead of copies of the accounts and reports required to be sent out in accordance with s 423.
Section 426(4) goes on to state that a summary financial statement must comply with the
requirements of s 427 (form and contents of summary financial statement: unquoted companies), or s 428 (form and contents of summary financial statement: quoted companies).
However, if default is made in complying with any provision of s 426, 427 or 428, or of regulations under any of those sections, an offence is committed by the company, and every officer
of the company who is in default (s 429).
With respect to a companyâ€™s annual accounts and reports, s 424(2) provides that a private
company must comply with s 423 not later than the end of the period for filing accounts
and reports, or if earlier, the date on which it actually delivers its accounts and reports to the
Registrar. A public company must comply with s 423 at least 21 days before the date of the
relevant accounts meeting (i.e. the accounts meeting of the company at which the accounts
and reports in question are to be laid) (s 424(3)). Section 424(4) goes on to provide that if a
public company sends out copies later than this they shall, despite that, be deemed to have
been duly sent if it is so agreed by all the members entitled to attend and vote at the relevant
accounts meeting.
If the company defaults in sending out copies of its accounts and reports, then under s 425
an offence is committed by the company, and every officer of the company who is in default.
Requirements in connection with publication of accounts
and reports
Section 433 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that every copy of a document that is published by or on behalf of the company must state the name of the person who signed it on
behalf of the board. In the case of an unquoted company, this applies to copies of the companyâ€™s balance sheet, and the directorsâ€™ report (s 433(2)). In the case of a quoted company,
this section applies to copies of the companyâ€™s balance sheet, the directorsâ€™ remuneration
report, and the directorsâ€™ report (s 433(3)). If a copy is published without the required statement of the signatoryâ€™s name, then an offence is committed under s 433(4) of the Act by the
company, and every officer of the company who is in default.
Section 434 states that if a company publishes any of its statutory accounts, they must be
accompanied by the auditorâ€™s report on those accounts (unless the company is exempt from
audit and the directors have taken advantage of that exemption). The term â€˜statutory accountsâ€™

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
is defined by s 434(3) as a companyâ€™s accounts for a financial year as required to be delivered
to the Registrar under s 441 (see below).
Section 435 deals with the requirements in relation to non-statutory accounts, which
must be published with a statement indicating: (a) that they are not the companyâ€™s statutory
accounts; (b) whether statutory accounts dealing with any financial year with which the nonstatutory accounts purport to deal have been delivered to the Registrar; and (c) whether an
auditorâ€™s report has been made on the companyâ€™s statutory accounts for any such financial
year, and if so whether the report: (i) was qualified or unqualified, or included a reference to
any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the
report; or (ii) contained a statement under s 498(2) (accounting records or returns inadequate or accounts or directorsâ€™ remuneration report not agreeing with records and returns);
or s 498(3) (failure to obtain necessary information and explanations). Section 435(2) goes on
to provide that the company must not publish with non-statutory accounts the auditorâ€™s
report on the companyâ€™s statutory accounts.
Finally, it is worth noting that under s 436(2) the term â€˜publicationâ€™ is defined as the
publishing, issuing or circulating of a document or otherwise making it available for public
inspection in a manner calculated to invite members of the public generally, or any class of
members of the public, to read it.
Filing of accounts and reports
Section 441 of the Companies Act 2006 states that the directors of a company are under a duty
to deliver to the Registrar for each financial year the accounts and reports required by: (i) s 444
(filing obligations of companies subject to small companies regime); (ii) s 445 (filing obligations of medium-sized companies); (iii) s 446 (filing obligations of unquoted companies); or
(iv) s 447 (filing obligations of quoted companies). The period allowed for the directors of a
company to comply with their obligation to deliver accounts and reports for a financial year
to the Registrar is referred to as the â€˜period for filingâ€™. Section 442(2)(a) states that for a private company, the period for filing is nine months after the end of the relevant accounting
reference period (i.e. the accounting reference period by reference to which the financial year
for the accounts in question was determined), while according to s 442(2)(b) for a public
company, it is six months after the end of that period. This is subject to s 442(3) (a companyâ€™s
first relevant accounting reference period) and s 442(4) (shortened relevant accounting
period due to notice given under s 392: alteration of accounting reference date).
Filing obligations: small companies
Section 444 sets out the filing obligations of companies subject to small companies regime.
Section 444(1) notes that the directors must deliver to the Registrar for each financial year a
copy of a balance sheet drawn up as at the last day of that year, and may also deliver to the
Registrar (i) a copy of the companyâ€™s profit and loss account for that year; and (ii) a copy of
the directorsâ€™ report for that year. Under s 444(2) they must also deliver to the Registrar a
copy of the auditorâ€™s report on those accounts and on the directorsâ€™ report, though this does
not apply if the company is exempt from audit and the directors have taken advantage of that
exemption. Section 444(4) goes on to state that if abbreviated accounts are delivered to the

Filing of accounts and reports
Registrar the obligation to deliver a copy of the auditorâ€™s report on the accounts is to deliver
a copy of the special auditorâ€™s report required by s 449.
According to s 444(5), where the directors of a company subject to the small companies
regime deliver to the Registrar IAS accounts, or Companies Act accounts that are not abbreviated accounts, and in accordance with this section (a) do not deliver to the Registrar a copy
of the companyâ€™s profit and loss account; or (b) do not deliver to the Registrar a copy of the
directorsâ€™ report, the copy of the balance sheet delivered to the Registrar must contain in a
prominent position a statement that the companyâ€™s annual accounts and reports have been
delivered in accordance with the provisions applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime.
Copies of the balance sheet and any directorsâ€™ report delivered to the Registrar must, under
s 444(6), state the name of the person who signed it on behalf of the board. Furthermore,
s 444(7) provides that the copy of the auditorâ€™s report must state the name of the auditor
and (where the auditor is a firm) the name of the person who signed it as senior statutory
auditor, or if the conditions in s 506 (circumstances in which names may be omitted) are met,
state that a resolution has been passed and notified to the Secretary of State in accordance
with that section.
Filing obligations: medium-sized companies
With respect to medium-sized companies, s 445(1) states that the directors must deliver to the
Registrar a copy of the companyâ€™s annual accounts, and the directorsâ€™ report. They must also
deliver to the Registrar a copy of the auditorâ€™s report on those accounts (and on the directorsâ€™
report), though this does not apply if the company is exempt from audit and the directors
have taken advantage of that exemption (s 445(2)).
Where the company prepares Companies Act accounts, s 445(3) provides that the directors may deliver to the Registrar a copy of the companyâ€™s annual accounts for the financial
year that includes a profit and loss account in which items are combined in accordance with
regulations made by the Secretary of State, and that does not contain items whose omission
is authorised by the regulations.
Copies of the balance sheet and directorsâ€™ report delivered to the Registrar must, under
s 445(5), state the name of the person who signed it on behalf of the board. Section 445(6)
goes on to provide that the copy of the auditorâ€™s report must state the name of the auditor
and (where the auditor is a firm) the name of the person who signed it as senior statutory
auditor, or if the conditions in s 506 are met, state that a resolution has been passed and
notified to the Secretary of State in accordance with that section.
Filing obligations: quoted companies
Finally, the filing obligations of quoted companies are covered by s 447 of the Companies Act
2006. According to s 447(1) the directors must deliver to the Registrar for each financial year
of the company a copy of the companyâ€™s annual accounts, the directorsâ€™ remuneration report,
and the directorsâ€™ report. They must also deliver a copy of the auditorâ€™s report on those
accounts (and on the directorsâ€™ remuneration report and the directorsâ€™ report) under s 447(2).
Section 447(3) goes on to provide that the copies of the balance sheet, the directorsâ€™ remuneration report and the directorsâ€™ report delivered to the Registrar under this section
must state the name of the person who signed it on behalf of the board. Furthermore, under

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
s 447(4) the copy of the auditorâ€™s report delivered to the Registrar under this section must
state the name of the auditor and (where the auditor is a firm) the name of the person who
signed it as senior statutory auditor, or if the conditions in s 506 are met, state that a resolution has been passed and notified to the Secretary of State in accordance with that section.
Failure to file accounts and reports
Under s 451(1) of the Companies Act 2006, if a company fails to file a copy of its annual
accounts and reports with the Registrar before the end of the period for filing those accounts
and reports, then every person who immediately before the end of that period was a director
of the company commits an offence. It is a defence for a person to prove that he took all
reasonable steps for securing that those requirements would be complied with before the end
of that period (s 451(2)), though it is not a defence to prove that the documents in question
were not in fact prepared as required by this Part of the Act (s 451(3)).
Section 452 goes on to provide that if a company fails to comply with the requirements of
s 441 and the directors fail to make good the default within 14 days after the service of a notice
on them requiring compliance, the court may, on the application of any member or creditor
of the company or of the Registrar, make an order directing the directors to make good the
default within such time as may be specified in the order.
Finally, where the requirements of s 441 are not complied with in relation to a companyâ€™s
accounts and reports for a financial year before the end of the period for filing those accounts
and reports, the company is liable to a civil penalty under s 453. This is in addition to any liability of the directors under s 451. Furthermore, the penalty may be recovered by the Registrar
and is to be paid into the Consolidated Fund (s 453(3)).
An audit is a process which is concerned to establish and confirm confidence in the accounting information yielded by the companyâ€™s records and systems so that an opinion may be
given upon the accounts which have been prepared by the company from those records and
systems. The audit is carried out primarily for the shareholders as a check upon the directorsâ€™
stewardship, but it is obviously also of benefit to creditors and potential investors. The statute
law relating to auditors in terms of their appointment, rights, remuneration, removal and
resignation are to be found in ss 485 to 526 of the 2006 Companies Act.
Appointment of auditors: public companies
At each general meeting at which accounts in respect of an accounting reference period are
laid, usually the annual general meeting, the members must appoint auditors who will hold
office until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts in respect of an
accounting reference period are laid.
In this regard, s 437 of the 2006 Act provides that the directors of a public company must
lay before the company in general meeting copies of its annual accounts and reports and this
must be complied with not later than the end of the period for filing the accounts and reports

in question. Section 438 goes on to provide that if these requirements are not complied with
before the end of the period allowed, every person who immediately before the end of that
period was a director of the company commits an offence.
Returning to the issue of appointment, s 489 states that an auditor or auditors of a public
company must be appointed for each financial year of the company, unless the directors reasonably resolve otherwise on the ground that audited accounts are unlikely to be required.
Under s 489(4) the members may appoint an auditor or auditors by ordinary resolution: (a)
at an accounts meeting; (b) if the company should have appointed an auditor or auditors at
an accounts meeting but failed to do so; (c) where the directors had power to appoint under
s 489(3) but have failed to make an appointment. Section 489(2) goes on to provide that for
each financial year for which an auditor or auditors is or are to be appointed (other than the
companyâ€™s first financial year), the appointment must be made before the end of the accounts
meeting of the company at which the companyâ€™s annual accounts and reports for the previous financial year are laid. Furthermore, the directors may appoint an auditor or auditors
of the company (a) at any time before the companyâ€™s first accounts meeting; (b) following a
period during which the company (being exempt from audit) did not have any auditor, at any
time before the companyâ€™s next accounts meeting; (c) to fill a casual vacancy in the office of
auditor (s 489(4)).
According to s 491, the auditor or auditors of a public company hold office in accordance with the terms of their appointment, subject to the requirements that they do not take
office until the previous auditor or auditors have ceased to hold office, and they cease to hold
office at the conclusion of the accounts meeting next following their appointment, unless
reappointed.
If no appointment is made by a public company, then under s 490, the Secretary of State
may appoint one or more persons to fill the vacancy.
Term of office of auditors of public company
According to s 491(1), the auditors of a public company hold office in accordance with the
terms of their appointment, subject to the requirements that: (a) they do not take office
until the previous auditor or auditors have ceased to hold office; and (b) they cease to hold
office at the conclusion of the accounts meeting next following their appointment, unless reappointed. Section 491(2) goes on to provide that this is without prejudice to the provisions
of this Part of the Act as to removal and resignation of auditors.
Removal and other special notice requirements
The members of a company may remove the auditors before the expiration of their office
under s 510 of the Companies Act 2006. If this is done the Registrar must be informed within
14 days of removal in accordance with s 512 of the 2006 Act. As regards procedure, s 511 provides that special notice is required for an ordinary resolution at a general meeting.
Section 511(3) states that the auditor may make representations in writing to the company and request their notification to the members of the company. Section 511(4) goes on
to provide that the company must: (a) in any notice of the resolution given to members of
the company, state the fact of the representations having been made; and (b) send a copy of
the representations to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is or has

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
been sent. If a copy of any such representations is not sent out as required because it was
received too late or because of the companyâ€™s default, the auditor may require that the representations be read out at the meeting in accordance with s 511(5). However, s 511(6) states
that copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need not
be read at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of any other person
claiming to be aggrieved, the court is satisfied that the auditor is using the provisions of this
section to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter.
Resignation
An auditor of a company may, under s 516 of the Companies Act 2006, resign his office at any
time by depositing at the registered office of the company a notice in writing to that effect.
The notice is not effective unless it is accompanied by the statement required by s 519 of the
Act. The date of his resignation is the date of the notice or such later date as may be specified
in the notice (s 516(3)). According to s 519, the notice of resignation must contain a statement of the circumstances connected with his ceasing to hold office.
Section 520 goes on to state that where the statement deposited under s 519 states the
circumstances connected with the auditorâ€™s ceasing to hold office, the company must within
14 days of the deposit of the statement either (a) send a copy of it to every person who under
s 423 is entitled to be sent copies of the accounts; or (b) apply to the court. If the company applies to the court, then under s 520(3), it must notify the auditor of the application.
Section 520(4) goes on to state that if the court is satisfied that the auditor is using the
provisions of s 519 to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter: (a) it shall direct that
copies of the statement need not be sent out; and (b) it may further order the companyâ€™s
costs on the application to be paid in whole or in part by the auditor, even if he is not a
party to the application. However, if no such direction is made, then under s 520(5) the
company must send copies of the statement to the persons mentioned in subsection (2)(a)
within 14 days of the courtâ€™s decision or, as the case may be, of the discontinuance of the
proceedings.
On receiving the auditorâ€™s notice of resignation, s 517 of the 2006 Act provides that the
company must send a copy of it to the Registrar within 14 days. In addition, if the notice contains a statement of circumstances connected with his resignation, s 521 states that a copy
must also be sent to the Registrar within 21 days.
Finally, s 523 provides that where an auditor ceases to hold office before the end of his
term of office, the company must notify the appropriate audit authority and the notice must
inform the appropriate audit authority that the auditor has ceased to hold office, and be
accompanied by: (i) a statement by the company of the reasons for his ceasing to hold office;
or (ii) if the copy of the statement deposited by the auditor at the companyâ€™s registered office
in accordance with s 519 contains a statement of circumstances in connection with his ceasing to hold office that need to be brought to the attention of members or creditors of the company, a copy of that statement. Section 523(3) provides that this must be later than 14 days
after the date on which the auditorâ€™s statement is deposited at the companyâ€™s registered office
in accordance with s 519. Similarly under s 522, a duty is placed on the auditor to notify the
appropriate audit authority. The notice must inform the appropriate audit authority that he
has ceased to hold office, and be accompanied by a copy of the statement deposited by him at
the companyâ€™s registered office in accordance with s 519. If the auditor fails to comply with
this provision then he commits an offence under s 522(5) of the 2006 Act.

Information and the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004
Duties of auditors
An auditor has two main duties: (1) to audit the accounts of the company; and (2) to report to
the members of the company on the accounts, i.e. on every balance sheet and profit and loss
account and all group accounts, if any, laid before the company in general meeting during his
tenure of office. The auditorâ€™s report must be open to inspection by any member.
As regards the role of the auditor in combating corporate fraud, expectations which the public and some in business have of the auditor often go beyond their role as auditors. Although
the term â€˜fraudâ€™ is often mentioned, there is in fact no crime of that name and if auditors are
to be responsible for exposing it or reporting on it, then there must first be legislation to define
what it is they are to report upon. There are some specific reporting duties in the field of money
laundering in connection with drugs or terrorism set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1993.
Reporting duties also exist in areas where organisations take deposits of the publicâ€™s money,
e.g. banking, insurance and investment funds, and, in particular, there is a duty on the auditors to a pension scheme to report to the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority if they
have reasonable grounds to believe that any duty imposed upon the scheme trustees, the
employer or any professional adviser is not being complied with and is of material significance. Sections 47 and 48 of the Pensions Act 1995 contain these â€˜whistleblowingâ€™ provisions.
In this connection, workers are protected in terms of whistleblowing on matters arising
during their employment by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. In relation to this and to
the receipt of information in this way generally, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales has issued a discussion paper, i.e. TECH 5/98, Receipt of Information in
Confidence by Auditors(and see below).
Rights of auditors
The auditors are given wide statutory rights and powers to enable them to obtain whatever
information they require for the purposes of their audit. In particular:
(a) they have a right of access at all times to the books, accounts and vouchers of the company and are entitled to require from the officers of the company such information and
explanation as they think necessary for the performance of their duties as auditors;
(b) it is a criminal offence for any officer of a company knowingly or recklessly to make a
statement which is misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular;
(c) they have a right to receive notices of and other communications relating to general
meetings and to attend them. They also have a right to be heard at any general meeting
which they attend on any part of the business which concerns them as auditors.
Information and the Companies (Audit, Investigations
and Community Enterprise) Act 2004
This Act entitles an auditor to require information from employees and to that extent widens
the auditorâ€™s sources of information. The right applies to subsidiary companies including

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
those that are non-GB where the parent company carries the responsibility for obtaining the
information.
In addition, it is a criminal offence to fail to provide information or explanations required
by the auditor.
The 2004 Act also requires the directorsâ€™ report to state that so far as eachdirector is aware
there is no relevant information of which the companyâ€™s auditors are unaware and that each
director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to ensure that the companyâ€™s auditors were
aware of it.
â€˜Relevant audit informationâ€™ is defined as information needed by the companyâ€™s auditors
in connection with the preparation of their report.
It is a criminal offence if a false statement is made applying to each director who knew or
was reckless as to the existence of undisclosed information. It does not seem possible for the
directors to make a qualified report.
Duty of care of the auditor
When carrying out their duties, auditors must exercise skill and care and the degree of skill
and care to be shown in particular in relation to the depth of the investigation and the sorts
of check to be made is to be found in judicial decisions. The relevant case law is summarised
(a) It is not their duty to see that the business is being run efficiently or profitably or to advise
on the conduct of the business. The auditorsâ€™ concern is to ascertain the true financial
position of the company at the time of the audit. However, an auditor is not an insurer
and does not guarantee that the accounting records show the true state of the companyâ€™s affairs. Nevertheless, he must be honest and not certify what he does not believe
to be true and must take reasonable care and skill before he believes that what he certifies
Re London and General Bank[1895] 2 Ch 166
The greater part of the capital of the bank, which was being wound up, had for some years been
advanced to four of the â€˜Balfourâ€™ companies and a few special customers on securities which were
insufficient and difficult of realisation. The auditors drew attention to the situation in a confidential
report to the directors, stressing its gravity, and ending by saying - â€˜We cannot conclude without
expressing our opinion unhesitatingly that no dividend should be paid this year.â€™ The chairman,
Mr Balfour, persuaded the auditors to strike this sentence out before the report was officially
laid before the board of directors. The certificate signed by the auditors and laid before the shareholders at the annual general meeting stated that â€˜the value of the assets as shown on the balance
sheet is dependent on realisationâ€™. As originally drawn, it also said - â€˜And on this point we have
reported specifically to the board.â€™ But again Mr Balfour persuaded them to withdraw this statement by promising to mention this in his speech to the shareholders which he did without drawing
special attention to it. The directors declared a dividend of 7 per cent.

Duty of care of the auditor
Held- by the Court of Appeal, affirming the decision of Vaughan Williams J - that the auditors had
been guilty of misfeasance, and were liable to make good the amount of dividend paid. It is the
duty of an auditor to consider and report to the shareholders, whether the balance sheet exhibits
a correct view of the state of the companyâ€™s affairs, and the true financial position at the time of
the audit. He must take reasonable care to see that his certification is true, and must place the
necessary information before the shareholders and not merely indicate the means of acquiring it.
In the course of his judgment Lindley LJ said:
An auditor [...] is not an insurer; he does not guarantee that the books correctly show the true
position of the companyâ€™s affairs; he does not even guarantee that his balance sheet is accurate
according to the books of the company [...] but, he must be honest, i.e. he must not certify what he
does not believe to be true, and he must use reasonable care and skill before he believes that what
he certifies is true. What is reasonable care in any particular case must depend upon the circumstances of the case.
Theobald, the auditor, stated the true position to the directors, and if he had done the same to
the shareholders, his duty would have been discharged.
(b) As we have seen, there is no statutory duty upon an auditor to detect fraud but if suspicions are aroused the auditor has a duty to investigate matters. A standard issued by the
Auditing Practices Board (SAS 110) states that an auditorâ€™s prime duty is to ensure that
the companyâ€™s accounts give a true and fair view of its position and not to detect fraud.
Nevertheless, says the standard, material fraud can distort a companyâ€™s accounts and
auditors should be alert to the possibility of its existence. Other guidelines issued by the
APB state that auditors may be barred from auditing financial services companies if they
detect fraud and fail to report on it to the relevant regulator, e.g. the Financial Services
Authority.
(c) An auditor may have to value shares and in this connection it should be noted that if
on the facts of the case the court takes the view that the auditor was employed in the
capacity of arbitrator rather than expert there is no liability in negligence. However,
in most cases the auditor will be regarded as valuing as an expert because the parties
are seldom in dispute with regard to the value of the shares and are simply seeking a
professional valuation. Where the auditor values as an expert he will be liable in negligence under the rule in Hedley Byrne & Co v Heller & Partners [1963] 2 All ER 575 if
he reaches a valuation without the exercise of proper skill and care. In addition, the
auditorsâ€™ valuation of shares is generally binding on the parties even if it is wrong.
The courts are reluctant to set aside a professional valuation in the absence of fraud,
or collusion (Baber v Kenwood Manufacturing Co [1978] 1 Lloydâ€™s Rep 175), and this
makes the remedy against the auditors more attractive provided, of course, negligence
can be established.
(d) The auditor should be familiar with the companyâ€™s constitution, i.e. its memorandum
and articles (Re Republic of Bolivia Exploration Syndicate Ltd [1914] 1 Ch 139) and
must, of course, check and verify the companyâ€™s accounts (Leeds Estate, Building and
Investment Co v Shepherd(1887) 36 Ch D 787).
(e) The auditor is not under a duty to take stock and can accept as honest any statements
made by the companyâ€™s officers and servants so long as he acts reasonably in so doing
and the circumstances are not suspicious (Re Kingston Cotton Mill Co (1896), below).
In other words, he must act as a reasonably careful and competent auditor would.

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
Re Kingston Cotton Mill Co[1896] 2 Ch 279
The directors of a company were enabled to pay dividends out of capital because the stock in
trade of the company was overstated for several years. The auditors had not required the production of the stock records but had accepted the certificate of the companyâ€™s manager regarding the
value of the stock.
Held - by the Court of Appeal - the auditors were not liable. It was stated that an auditor is â€˜a
watchdog not a bloodhoundâ€™. He can assume that the companyâ€™s servants are honest and can rely
upon statements they make unless there are suspicious circumstances which would give reason
for distrust. PerLopes LJ:
It is the duty of an auditor to bring to bear on the work he has to perform that skill, care and caution
which a reasonably competent, careful and cautious auditor would use. What is reasonable skill, care
and caution must depend on the particular circumstances of each case. An auditor is not bound to
be a detective, or, as was said, to approach his work with suspicion, or with a foregone conclusion
that there is something wrong. He is a watchdog, but not a bloodhound. He is justified in believing
tried servants of the company in whom confidence is placed by the company. He is entitled to assume
that they are honest and to rely upon their representations, provided he uses reasonable care. If there
is anything calculated to excite suspicion, he should probe it to the bottom; but in the absence of anything of that kind he is only bound to be reasonably cautious and careful [...] It is not the duty of an
auditor to take stock; he is not a stock expert; there are many matters on which he must rely on the
honesty and accuracy of others.
The rule laid down in the above case has been modified by subsequent cases. In Westminster
Road Construction and Engineering Company Ltd(1932) unreported, a company paid dividend
out of profits which were overstated by reason of the overvaluation of work in progress. This figure
was supplied by the manager and secretary and it was held that the auditor was liable to repay the
money paid out as dividend because he had accepted the certificate given by them without making proper enquiries which would have revealed that the valuation was inflated.
See also Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co Ltd, 1925 (Chapter 17).
It should be borne in mind, however, that the cases relating to the general duty of care
of the auditor are rather old and that professional standards have risen since they were
decided. Thus, it is now generally accepted that an auditor should not rely on the accuracy
and honesty of other persons even in the matter of stocktaking, and that he should carry
out a check on at least one or more sample items. The standard of care required of an
auditor at the present time was probably more accurately expressed by Lord Denning in
Fomento (Sterling Area) Ltd vSelsdon Fountain Pen Co Ltd[1958] 1 WLR 45 at p 61 where
An auditor is not confined to the mechanics of checking vouchers and making arithmetical
computations. He is not to be written off as a professional â€˜adder-upper and subtractorâ€™. His
vital task is to take care to see that errors are not made, be they errors of computation, or errors
of omission or commission, or downright untruths. To perform this task properly he must
come to it with an enquiring mind - not suspicious of dishonesty [...] - but suspecting that
someone may have made a mistake somewhere and that a check must be made to ensure that
there has been none.
This higher duty of care was to some extent applied in the following case.

Auditorsâ€™ liability
Re Thomas Gerrard & Son Ltd[1968] Ch 455
The managing director of the company had falsified the accounts by three methods one of which
involved including non-existent stock and altering invoices. The auditors who were put on inquiry
by alterations of invoices negligently failed to investigate the matter and gave a falsely favourable
picture of the profits of the company as a result of which it declared dividends it would not otherwise have declared which in turn resulted in extra tax being payable. The company was wound up
and in misfeasance proceedings under what is now s 212 of the Insolvency Act 1986 against the
auditors they claimed that they had not been given enough time to do their work.
Held- this was no defence and the auditors must repay the dividends, the cost of recovering the
extra tax and any of the extra tax not recoverable. In the course of his judgment Pennycuick J
made the following points:
(i) if directors do not allow the auditors adequate time to make proper investigations, they must
either refuse to make a report at all or qualify it;
(ii) while leaving open the question whether the auditors would have been in breach of duty
had the only fraud been falsification of stock, the judge held that once they were on notice of the
altered invoices, they had a duty to make an exhaustive inquiry. Having failed to do so, they were
liable to the company under what is now s 212 of the Insolvency Act 1986.
Auditorsâ€™ liability
The liability of auditors can be brought under three headings as set out below.
By statute
As we have seen in Re Thomas Gerrard (above) an auditor may be liable in a winding-up
for misfeasance or breach of any fiduciary or other duty in relation to the company. Under
this provision an order may be made to repay money or to make compensation as the court
thinks just.
In contract
An auditor has a contract with the company and if he is in breach of his duty in regard to the
work he has agreed to do for the company, which is normally set out in a â€˜letter of engagementâ€™, he can be sued by the company for damages.
The claim here will normally be in negligence. It is unlikely that a professional person would
make statements which he knew to be false in order dishonestly to deceive a party, but if he
did the claim would be in the tort of deceit.
To succeed in a claim for negligence, the claimant must show that the defendant auditor
owed him a duty of care, that the auditor was in breach of that duty, and finally that the
breach caused the damage to the claimant.

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
Duty of care
The duty of care in regard to negligent misstatements by auditors has been considered in a
number of cases since the early 1950s. However, the present position has been the subject of
comprehensive analysis by the House of Lords in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman[1990] 1
All ER 568 and by the High Court in Al Saudi Banque v Clarke Pixley[1989] 3 All ER 361.
From these decisions and important later ones the position would appear to be as follows:
(a) Auditors do not owe a duty of care to potential investors in the company, e.g. those
who rely on the audited accounts when contemplating a takeover bid. The fact that the
accounts and auditorsâ€™ report might foreseeably come into their hands and be relied on
is not enough to create a duty of care. In addition, it was decided in James McNaughton
Paper Group v Hicks Anderson[1991] 1 All ER 134 that even if an auditor knew that the
audited accounts would be used by a bidder as the basis of a bid, he would not be liable
if he reasonably believed and was entitled to assume that the bidder would also seek the
advice of his own accountant.
(b) Auditors do not owe a duty of care to potential investors even if they already hold shares
in the company since, although they are shareholders and auditors are under a statutory
duty to report to shareholders, the duty of the auditors is to the shareholders as a whole
and not to shareholders as individuals.
(c) Even where the auditors are aware of the person or persons who will rely upon the
accounts, they are not liable unless they also know what the person or persons concerned
will use them for, e.g. as the basis for a takeover.
(d) Where there is knowledge of user and use, then in that restricted situation the Court of
Appeal held in Morgan Crucible Co plc v Hill Samuel Bank Ltd[1991] 1 All ER 148 that
a duty of care would exist in regard to the user. However, even in such a situation the
auditor will not be liable if, in the circumstances, he was entitled to assume that the user
would also seek the advice of his own accountant and not rely solely on the audited
accounts (see the McNaughtoncase, above).
(e) A case which appears to widen the liability of auditors beyond misstatements to mere
omissions is Coulthard v Neville Russell[1998] 1 BCLC 143, where the Court of Appeal
held that as a matter of principle auditors have a duty of care to advise that a transaction
which the company and its directors intend to carry out might be a breach of the finan-
âž¨ See p. 144 cial assistance provisions of the Companies Act (see also Chapter 7 âž¨).
(f) In addition, the High Court ruled in Abbott v Strong (1998) The Times, 9 July, that a
circular issued by a company to its shareholders in connection with a rights issue and
allegedly containing misleading profit forecasts by the directors together with an allegedly
negligent letter from the companyâ€™s accountants and management consultants affirming
that the forecast statement was properly compiled and in accordance with the companyâ€™s
accounting policies did not lead to the accountants having a duty of care in negligence
to the shareholders who acquired shares in the rights issue so that their attempt to claim
against the accountants failed. Mr Justice Ferris ruled that the accountants did not owe a
duty of care to the shareholders individually for their alleged loss. The judge proceeded
by analogy with the issue of shares under listing particulars or prospectus. In such cases,
as we have seen, there is a requirement that any statement by accountants should make
clear that it has been given with their consent and that the consent has not been withdrawn. This shows that the accountants adhere to or are part of the issue process and, of
course, in that situation they can be liable for their misstatements. There was, said the

Auditorsâ€™ liability
judge, no such statement in this case. Once again, the court has decided that there is no
duty of care in those advising companies to the individual shareholders, maintaining the
Caparoline. There were in fact 200 claimants in this case, so the decision may be based
on public policy, bearing in mind the problems of obtaining indemnity insurance.
(g) The High Court has ruled that two companies that invested venture capital in a shopfitting company that later went into receivership were entitled to damages from the companyâ€™s auditors on the basis of negligent misstatements by the auditors in the companyâ€™s
accounts and in letters sent by the auditors to the investing companies. The auditors
owed those companies a duty of care (see Yorkshire Enterprises Ltd vRobson Rhodes New
Law Online(1998) 17 June, Transcript Case No 2980610103 approved judgment). A main
problem had been that the provision for bad debts was inadequate. The court was saying
in summary that if the auditors had carried out the audit work thoroughly, they would
have found certain bookkeeping errors and would have made a greater and more appropriate provision for bad debt (or qualified the accounts). In consequence, the auditors
were liable in damages. The facts of the case showed that the auditors were aware of the
user of their statements and the use to which they would be put.
Breach of duty
An auditor will not be liable if, given a duty of care, he is not in breach of it. An auditor is not
likely to be in breach of duty if he follows Auditing Standards and Guidelines, Statements of
Standard Accounting Practice and Financial Reporting Standards devised and issued by the
profession. If he does that, he will at least have the advantage of the judgment of McNair J
in Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 2 All ER 118. He said in connection with doctors: â€˜A doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance
with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art...merely because there is a body of opinion who would take a contrary view.â€™
The statement is of course equally applicable to other professions including that of accountant and auditor.
In addition, the explanatory foreword to the professionâ€™s Auditing Standards and Guidelines
states that â€˜a court of law may, when considering the adequacy of work of an auditor, take into
account any pronouncements or publications which it thinks may be indicative of good
practice. Auditing standards and guidelines are likely to be so regarded.â€™
The importance of professional pronouncements was also stressed in Lloyd Cheyham v
Littlejohn[1987] BCLC 303 where Woolf J remarked that â€˜while SSAPs are not conclusive so that
a departure from their terms necessarily involves a breach of duty of care and they are not rigid
rules, they are very strong evidence as to what is the proper standard which should be adopted
and unless there is some justification a departure will be regarded as constituting a breach of
This statement would, of course, apply with equal force to the more recent Financial
Reporting Standards.
The effect of the decision in Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Trust[1997] 4 All ER 771
âž¨ See p. 195 is considered in Chapter 9 âž¨ in relation to company distributions and should be referred to
again at this point by way of revision.
It must be shown that the breach caused the damage. Thus, in JEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks Bloom
& Co[1983] 1 All ER 583, the accounts of BG Fasteners were prepared by the defendants who

Chapter 23 Accounts and audit
were the auditors of BG. Unknown to the auditors, they were handed to the directors of JEB
by the directors of BG as part of a takeover discussion. JEB took over BG and then complained
through its directors that it had paid too much for BG and that this was the result of relying
on the defendantsâ€™ accounts which, it was alleged, were negligently prepared and showed BG
to be a better proposition than it actually was.
In the High Court it was decided that the auditors should have foreseen the use of the
accounts by JEB in the takeover and that this was enough to establish the duty of care. This
part of the decision cannot now be supported in view of the requirement of knowledge of use
and user in Caparo and subsequent cases. However, the High Court went on to hold that the
auditors were not liable because it appeared in evidence that a major motive in taking over
BG was to obtain the technical services of its two directors. It was admitted that JEB would
have taken over BG anyway, regardless of the accuracy or otherwise of BGâ€™s annual accounts.
The auditorsâ€™ alleged negligence did not cause the damage and they were not liable.
Developments in exclusion of liability
The case of Royal Bank of Scotland plcv Bannerman Johnstone Maclay (a firm)2003 SLT 181
raised issues in regard to auditorsâ€™ liability and also their ability to exclude that liability.
The bank lent money to a company APC Ltd on the strength of accounts audited by the
defendants. It was alleged by the claimant that the audited accounts were less than adequately
informative in terms, for example, of the going concern factor. The bank had later to appoint
a receiver to the company which was insolvent.
The auditors had notice that under overdraft facility letters the bank was entitled to see
management accounts and annual audited accounts. However, they contended that the
claimant had to prove that as auditors they intended the bank to rely on the accounts to make
further loans or advances. The auditors said in effect â€˜when auditing the accounts our only
intention was to carry out Companies Act duties to audit the accountsâ€™. The Scottish Court
of Session (Outer House) in this case, equally applicable in England and Wales, ruled that the
case law did not support a requirement of intention. The compelling effect of the authorities
was that knowledge of user and use formed the basis of a duty of care for those making information or advice available. The auditors had the requisite knowledge and therefore owed a
duty of care.
On appeal to the Inner House of the Court of Session in May 2005, it was held that the
element of positive intention was not a sine qua nonof the existence of a duty of care and the
pursuers were entitled to inquiry on the averments made. The absence of a disclaimer might
be a relevant circumstance pointing to an assumption of responsibility in respect of the information or advice tendered. A major matter relating to this case was that the auditors had
not disclaimed liability to third parties such as the bank. In this connection, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has stated that it is clear that auditors assume
responsibility for the contents of the audit report to shareholders as a body under s 495 of the
Companies Act 2006. It also states that the absence of a disclaimer may in some cases enable
a court to draw an inference that the auditors have assumed responsibility for the audit report
to a third party such as the bank in this case. The ICAEW recommends that auditors include
the following wording in audit reports to clarify their duty of care to third parties by indicating that no such duty is owed.
This report is made solely to the companyâ€™s members as a body, in accordance with s 495 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the

Essay questions
companyâ€™s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditorâ€™s report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companyâ€™s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Capping liability
For the larger firms of accountants providing audit services indemnity insurance adequate
to cover potential liability is not available. The sums of damages potentially involved are of
Armageddon proportions. In consequence the profession continues to lobby the government
for a statutory cap on their liability. Failure by the government to respond may result in the
larger groups of companies and public authorities being unable to obtain audit services.

3 Lagjet Ltd has a fully issued authorised share capital of Â£40,000 divided into 40,000 ordinary
Â£1 shares; 75p has been paid up on each share. The shares are allocated as follows:
the directors, Constance, Alan and Jack, each hold 6,500 shares;
James holds 9,500 shares; Alfred and Florence each hold 5,500 shares.
The board wishes to call an extraordinary general meeting to pass the following resolutions:
1 to reduce the companyâ€™s share capital by extinguishing the liability of shareholders in
respect of the unpaid capital on their shares;
2 to appoint a new auditor, Bill, to fill a casual vacancy caused by the sudden death of the
auditor appointed at the last annual general meeting.
James, who is owed Â£5,000 by the company for goods supplied, is opposed to the proposal to
reduce the share capital. Alfred and Florence are opposed to the choice of Bill as auditor.
(a) Advise the board on the following matters:
(i) the statutory provisions relating to length of notice before such resolutions can be validly
presented to an extraordinary general meeting;
(ii) the number of votes which must be secured before the above resolutions can be
(iii) any further action it can take to secure the appointment of Bill as auditor if it fails to

(b) Multifix plc borrowed Â£1,000,000 from Moneybags giving as security a floating charge over
all its undertakings. A clause in the contract provided that the company was not to create
any other charges over its assets ranking in priority to or pari passuwith the floating charge
created in favour of Moneybags. Multifix purchased land and several buildings for development and resold most of the properties for substantial profits. A fixed charge was created
over the unsold properties valued at Â£1,500,000 in favour of Finance Limited to secure
moneys borrowed from the latter. Multifix has now gone into insolvent liquidation.

Amalgamations, reconstructions and

The ways in which companies can alter their structures are set out below.
Objects clause
This is less of a problem after CA 2006 s 31 which now provides that unless a companyâ€™s
articles specifically restrict the objects of a company, its objects are unrestricted.
Reduction of capital
If the company merely wishes to reduce its share capital it may do so under the procedures
âž¨ See p. 162 set out in Chapter 8 âž¨. Sections 641-651 of the CA 2006 govern how a company may reduce
its share capital.
Companies limited by shares - dual regime
There are two methods for companies limited by shares to reduce their share capital:
1 Court approved reduction of capital: available to both private and public companies
limited by shares.
2 Reduction of capital supported by a solvency statement: only available to private companies limited by shares.
Unlimited companies
Unlimited companies are free to reduce their share capital by membersâ€™ resolution without
needing either court approval or a solvency statement (provided they have the power to do so
in their articles of association).
The default position under the CA 2006 is that a company limited by shares is free to
reduce capital by special resolution of its members (supported by either court approval or, for
private companies only, a solvency statement) provided such a reduction is not prohibited by
its articles (s 641(6)).
Section 641 of the CA 2006 does not apply to unlimited companies. Therefore, an unlimited company should not undertake a reduction of capital unless it has an article giving it
express authority to do so.
Variation of shareholdersâ€™ rights under the memorandum and
articles or under the Companies Acts
If the company wishes to alter the rights of shareholders, this can be effected by the approval
of the variation at class meetings followed by a special resolution of the company. There is, of
course, always the possibility that dissentients within the class will apply to the court (see
âž¨ See p. 144 further Chapter 7 âž¨).
The relevant sections apply only to registered companies and in addition do not enable any
variation to be made in the rights of creditors, including debenture holders. Often, however,
the trust deed of an issue of debentures will contain a similar variation clause under which
the rights of debenture holders can be varied. In such a case, however, the only remedy of
dissenting debenture holders is to plead a general fraud on the minority.

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
Purchase of own shares and financial assistance
As we have seen, the Companies Acts allow the purchase by a company of its own shares
(see further Chapter 8 âž¨), and lays down procedures under which a company may give, in
appropriate circumstances, financial assistance for the acquisition of its shares (see further
âž¨ See p. 162 Chapter 8 âž¨).
Re-registration
It should also be borne in mind that a private limited company may now re-register as unlimited, but only with the consent of all the members, and that an unlimited company may reregister as a private limited company, though with the preservation of the liability of former
members (Insolvency Act 1986, s 77).
Other methods of changing corporate structures
In addition to the areas of reconstruction described above, for most of the transactions
which a company wishes to enter into, the powers of the board combined with the approval
of 51 per cent of the members in general meeting will suffice. Why, then, is it necessary to
include in the CA 2006, ss 895, 896 and 899 and in the Insolvency Act 1986, ss 110 et seqs provisions to deal with arrangements and reconstructions?
The reason is that the provisions referred to above do not permit a company to compela
shareholder to sell or otherwise dispose of his shares, except as part of a reduction when he is,
for example, paid off, or under CA 2006, ss 979(1)-(4) in a takeover (see below). Nor do they
allow the rights of creditors to be affected or enable the liability of members to be increased
without their individual consent. Nor, again, do they provide a means of amalgamating two or
more companies or the transfer of the undertaking of one company to another, or the demerger
or partition of a company into separate management in another company or companies.
Sections 895, 896 and 899 of the CA 2006 and s 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provide
procedures for these kinds of changes to be made in a corporate structure.
In addition, there are some companies which cannot remedy internal problems by the use
of the specific procedures referred to above. For example, the provisions allowing variation of
shareholdersâ€™ rights do not apply to companies which do not have a share capital. Therefore,
if the rights of members are to be varied, ss 895, 896 and 899 will be used.
The provisions on schemes of arrangements and reconstructions in ss 425-427 of CA 1985
are now contained in Part 26 of the CA 2006 and the provisions on mergers and divisions in
s 427A of public companies are now contained in Part 27 of the 2006 Act. Parts 26 and 27 came
into force on 6 April 2008 as a result of The Companies Act 2006 (Commencement No. 5,
Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2007 (SI 2007/3495). The sections in Part 26 of
CA 2006 restate the provisions of ss 425-427 of the CA 1985, with some drafting amendments
and consequential changes as a result of changes to provisions in other Parts of the CA 2006.
Part 27 of the CA 2006 restates the provisions contained in s 427A and Sch 15B to the CA
1985. However, the provisions have been reorganised into a separate chapter for each of
mergers and divisions, thereby making the provisions more accessible, depending on the
structure chosen by a public company for the scheme of arrangement.
Sections 895 and 896 restate ss 425(1) and (6) of the CA 1985 and grant the power for a
company; any of the companyâ€™s creditors or members; or a liquidator or administrator (if the

company is being wound up or an administration order is in force in relation to it), to apply
to the court to sanction a compromise or arrangement, as well as providing for the convening of the relevant meetings by the court.
Section 897 restates s 426 of the CA 1985 and prescribes the details that must be contained
in the statement that accompanies a notice convening a meeting of creditors or members. The
duty of directors and trustees to provide information to the company for the purposes of the
statement (section 426(7), CA 1985) has been restated in section 898 of CA 2006.
Section 899 restates s 425(2) of the CA 1985 and sets out the condition that must be
satisfied before the court can sanction a compromise or agreement, namely if, at a meeting
properly summoned, a majority in number, representing 75 per cent in value of the creditors
or class of creditors or members or class of members (as the case may be), agree to the compromise or arrangement. Section 899(2) provides that the persons who may apply for a court
order sanctioning a compromise or arrangement are the same as those who may apply to
the court for an order for a meeting (under s 896(2)). Section 899 also restates the first part
of s 425(3) of the CA 1985, which provides that the courtâ€™s order has no effect until a copy of
it has been delivered to the Registrar (s 899(4)).
Section 900 restates ss 427(1) to (6) of the CA 1985 and provides powers for the court to
make provisions to facilitate a reconstruction or amalgamation and requires a copy of any
court order made pursuant to the courtâ€™s powers to make provisions to facilitate a reconstruction or amalgamation to be delivered to the Registrar within seven days of the making of
such court order.
Section 901 restates part of ss 425(3) and 425(4) of the CA 1985, but with consequential
amendments to reflect the new provisions under the CA 2006 relating to a companyâ€™s memorandum and articles of association. The requirement in s 425(3) of the CA 1985 for a copy
of the courtâ€™s order to be annexed to every copy of the companyâ€™s memorandum is replaced
with a requirement to annex a copy of any order under s 899 (order sanctioning a compromise or arrangement) and any order under s 900 (order facilitating reconstruction or amalgamation) that alters the companyâ€™s constitution to every copy of the companyâ€™s articles
issued after the order has been made, unless the effect of the order has been incorporated into
the articles by amendment (s 901(3)). A reference to the companyâ€™s articles includes the
memorandum, so the order must be attached to both.
In addition, if the order amends the companyâ€™s articles or any resolution or agreement
affecting the companyâ€™s constitution, the copy of the order delivered to the Registrar must be
accompanied by a copy of the companyâ€™s articles or the relevant resolution or agreement, as
amended. These changes have been included for consistency with other provisions in the CA
2006 concerning such orders.
Re NFU Development Trust Ltd[1973] 1 All ER 135
The company was limited by guarantee without a share capital and had 94,000 members. All members could vote at general meetings and in the event of a winding-up had a right to the surplus
assets of the company in such proportions as the directors should determine. The company proposed a scheme of arrangement where in order to reduce the expense of administration in sending out notices and other communications to the 94,000 members, the number of members of the
company would be reduced to seven, all the other members being deprived of their membership.
At a meeting to consider the scheme 85 per cent of the votes were cast in favour of it. Application
was then made to the court to sanction the scheme.

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
Held - by Brightman J - that the scheme would not be approved. It was not a compromise or
arrangement within the terms of s 425. The rights of members were being expropriated without any
compensating advantage and in this sense it could not be said that they were entering into a compromise or arrangement with the company.
The CA 1985, s 425 (ss 895 et seq in the CA 2006) had to be used here, albeit unsuccessfully,
because the company did not have a share capital, which meant that the usual variation of rights
procedure was not available. Brightman J suggested that the solution was that members who were
not interested in receiving, e.g. reports and accounts, should be asked to resign.
Amalgamations and reconstructions
The term â€˜reconstructionâ€™ is not defined by company legislation. However, it may be said that
in a reconstruction the undertaking of the company concerned is preserved and is carried on
after reconstruction by substantially the same people as it was before.
The contrast with an â€˜amalgamationâ€™ is that while a reconstruction consists of the reorganisation of one company or group, an amalgamation involves two or more companies
(e.g. A and B) being brought together under one. That one may be either a new company, C,
to absorb both A and B, or one of the companies, say B, may absorb the other, A.
Nevertheless, CA 2006, ss 900 et seq, which is the major reconstruction section of the 2006
Act, can be used to effect an amalgamation by takeover by one company of another.
The takeover
Section 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is useful in obtaining mergers where the boards of
the companies concerned are willing for the merger to take place. If they face opposition from
members and/or creditors, then CA 2006, ss 895 et seqwould be the better approach.
In a takeover proper, the board of the company to be acquired, say B, is not willing to
co-operate so that the company seeking to acquire is forced to address an offer direct to the
shareholders of B.
In an amalgamation or takeover involving A and B where A and B are in a similar line of
business or are complementary, as where A makes the goods and B markets them, there is
potentially a monopoly. In such a case the Secretary of State for BIS may, on the recommendation of the Director of Fair Trading, refer the merger to the Competition Commission
under the Competition Act 1998. The merger will not then proceed until the Commission
agrees that it should.
When a merger has been referred to the Commission, the parties are prohibited, for the
duration of the inquiry, from acquiring shares in any of the other parties without the consent
of the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State is permitted to accept legally binding undertakings for part of the
merged business to be disposed of, as an alternative to reference to the Commission.
Formerly these undertakings had to involve agreements to dispose of parts of the business.
The Competition Act 1998 now provides for the acceptance of a wider range of undertakings,
such as agreements for the future conduct of the business.

Amalgamation (or reconstruction) under the Insolvency Act 1986, s 110
The Coalition Government announced as of 15 October 2010 that it will merge the
Competition Commission into the Office of Fair Trading.
Amalgamation (or reconstruction) under
the Insolvency Act 1986, s 110
Section 110 gives a liquidator power to accept shares as consideration for the sale of the property of a company, so that if A is in voluntary liquidation it may empower its liquidator by
special resolution to sell its business and assets to B in exchange for Bâ€™s shares.
The section would be used where there was no real opposition to an amalgamation by
the members of A and no compromise with creditors was necessary. There are no provisions for variation of creditorsâ€™ rights. Creditors are still entitled to prove in the liquidation
If, in order to effect a reconstruction, the transfer of the undertaking of one company, A,
to another, B, is to be associated with the liquidation of A, the scheme may be carried out
under s 110 provided no compromises are required. For example, the section may be used to
demerge, as where the various business activities of one large company, A, are placed under
separate management in a number of other companies, B, C and D, and A is wound up. It
may also be used to partition companies, as where a family company, E, is carrying on various activities and certain members of the family wish to carry on the activities separately
through independent companies, F, G and H, and E is to be wound up.
This is as follows:
(a) The company proposing to be wound up voluntarily will pass a special resolution for
winding-up and appoint a liquidator.
(b) It will authorise the liquidator by special resolution to transfer the companyâ€™s assets to a
new company in return for shares in the new company. The new company may be one
formed for the purpose or it may be an existing company.
(c) Such shares will be distributed among the members of the old company.
(d) Any member who did not vote in favour of the resolution can express his dissent by serving a written notice on the liquidator within seven days requiring him either:
(i) to abstain from carrying the scheme into effect; or
(ii) to purchase his shares at a price to be fixed by agreement or by arbitration, and the
company must not be wound up until any such dissentient has been paid off, so that
opposition from too many members could be costly.
(e) In Paynev The Cork Co Ltd[1900] 1 Ch 308 it was held that any provision in the articles
preventing a member from dissenting was void.
(f) If an order for the compulsory winding-up of the company is made within a year, the
special resolution authorising the transfer is void unless the leave of the court is given.
(g) It should be noted that in the case of a creditorâ€™s voluntary winding-up, the consent of
the liquidation committee (if any) or the court is necessary. Apart from this there is no
provision for a compromise with creditors.

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
Amalgamation (or reconstruction) under the CA 2006,
If on a company reconstruction any compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
company and its members or creditors s 895 must be used. The use of s 900 (as well) is essential for amalgamation where rights of members, debenture holders and creditors are to be
compromised.
This is as follows:
(a) The court has to be consulted at the outset and must be asked to direct the holding of
meetings of members, creditors and debenture holders to discuss the proposed scheme.
At this first stage the court will not exercise its discretion to call the meetings if, having
regard to the opposition to the scheme by the holders of the majority of the votes, the
meetings will serve no useful purpose. In addition, the court is concerned to see that the
meetings are properly constituted. For example, a class meeting of shareholders may not
be enough if there are groups within each class with different interests (Re Hellenic and
âž¨ See p. 2 General Trust Ltd, 1975; see further Chapter 1 âž¨). The same problems can exist with
creditors who may have different interests, e.g. some may have securities and others not.
However, in Anglo-American Insurance Ltd[2001] 1 BCLC 755 the High Court ruled
that separate meetings of creditors were not required even though some were short term
and some long term or resident in the USA. It appeared that they all had the same substantial rights under the scheme. The problems presented by a challenge to the suitability of the meetings held should not occur unless the companyâ€™s creditor and/or member
structure is significantly diverse. This view is supported by the decision in Re Hawk
Insurance Co Ltd[2001] All ER (D) 289 (Feb) which is to the effect that unless significant
and substantial differences in rights exist all creditors/members are capable of consulting
together. The decision prevents unreasonable and oppressive complaints by minority
interests but it has also, some say, significantly reduced the consideration and protection
of minority concerns.
If the court agrees, the meetings will be summoned and full details of the scheme presented. The scheme may involve a winding-up of the company and a transfer of assets
under CA 2006, ss 895, 896 and 899 (see below) or it may be an internal reconstruction
of the kind seen in NFU Development Trust Ltd, 1973. In particular, the scheme must
disclose the effect of the amalgamation upon directors, especially where it involves the
retirement of some of them and payment to them of compensation for loss of office. This
must be disclosed in the notices and sanctioned by the members.
Where the rights of debenture holders are affected, a reference to the material interests, if any, of the trustees for the debenture holders must be disclosed as for directors.
(b) The scheme must be approved by a majority in number and three-quarters in value of the
members, creditors and debenture holders. For example, if a company has 100 members
and A has got 901 shares of Â£1 each, and the other 99 members have one share each, then
the rest cannot force a scheme on A. Equally, A plus 49 of the rest cannot force a scheme

Amalgamation (or reconstruction) under the CA 2006, s 895
on the remainder but A plus 50 of the rest can force the scheme on the others. The same
rules apply to creditors and debenture holders. The court must then be asked to consent
to the scheme as approved. The court will have to be satisfied in particular that creditors
are not being prejudiced by the scheme of arrangement proposed by the company; and
creditors have not only the right to hold their own meeting before the court hearing, as
we have seen, but also to be represented in court on the issue of the courtâ€™s approval. In
practice, the company will make sure at a very early stage that creditors are fully satisfied
with the proposed scheme and will not raise objections. Furthermore, the court must be
satisfied that there is a genuine â€˜compromise or arrangementâ€™ within the meaning of CA
2006, s 895; this implies some element of accommodation on each side, so that a scheme
involving the total surrender of the rights of one side will not be approved (see NFU
Development Trust Ltd, 1973).
(c) If the court approves the scheme it will do so by order and a copy of the court order
certified is delivered to the Registrar at which point the scheme becomes binding on all
concerned (s 901, CA 2006).
Although any member or creditor can ask the court to convene meetings under CA 2006,
s 895, provided some compromise or arrangement is proposed, it appears that the court cannot do this unless the company has generated, or at least approves of, the scheme. Thus in Re
Savoy Hotel Ltd[1981] 3 All ER 646, Trusthouse Forte had made a bid for the shares of Savoy
but could not get acceptance from the major class of voting shareholders. Trusthouse Forte
asked the court to convene a meeting of those shareholders under former CA 1985, s 425 so
that the bid might be discussed with them, and hopefully they might be convinced to accept
it. The judge held that he had no power to convene the meeting because the Savoy Company
had not generated the scheme, nor did the board or the voting members appear to approve
However, where the board and the majority of the shareholders of the company to be
acquired wish to accept the bid a scheme under CA 2006, s 899 is useful, because s 899 only
requires a majority in number and 75 per cent in value of the shareholders attending a meeting and voting in favour of the acquisition of their company to bind any dissenting minority,
whereas under a normal takeover offer 90 per cent of the shareholders of the victim company
must accept the bid before the predator company can compulsorily acquire the rest.
The provisions of the CA 2006, s 900 (formerly CA 1985, s 427)
Where a scheme under CA 2006, s 900 involves a winding-up, either to an internally reconstructed new company having the same members, debenture holders and creditors, or to a
new or existing company as part of a merger, the court may by order:
(a) transfer assets to the other company;
(b) allot shares or debentures to members and debenture holders of the old company;
(c) allow the old companyâ€™s actions to be brought in the name of the other company;
(d) dissolve the old company without a winding-up;
(e) provide for dissentients otherwise than outlined in the scheme, e.g. by requiring them to
be paid off.
Orders made under s 900 must be filed with the Registrar (CA 2006, s 901).

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
Examples of schemes of internal reconstruction approved by
the court under the CA 2006, s 900
Where s 900 is used internally, it represents a means by which a company can enter into a
compromise or arrangement with its creditors and/or members without going into liquidation. Schedule 4, Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986 allows a compromise with creditors in the
context of a winding-up, though Part I of the 1986 Act also provides a procedure for compromise with creditors, even though the company concerned is not in the course of windingup. These provisions are considered in more detail later.
The court has approved the following types of internal reconstructions under ss 427(1) to
(6) of the CA 1985 (which has been restated in CA 2006, s 900):
(a) Debenture holders have given extension of time for the payment of their loan capital.
(b) Debenture holders have accepted a cash payment less than the par value of the debentures.
(c) Debenture holders have given up their security, thus releasing it to secure further loans.
(d) Debenture holders have exchanged their debentures for shares.
(e) Creditors have taken cash in part payment of their debt and the balance in shares.
(f) Preference shareholders have given up their right to arrears of dividend.
(g) To simplify the capital structure of companies within a group, as where H is the holding
company of several partly owned subsidiaries, all of which have old-fashioned complex
capital structures comprising many types of shares carrying widely varying rights. The
capital structure of the group has been simplified by exchanging all the subsidiary companiesâ€™ shares held by minority shareholders for ordinary shares or even loan stock in the
holding company by means of a scheme of arrangement.
As (g) above shows, reconstruction does not necessarily involve compromising with creditors, nor is it always set in a context of financial difficulty. It is, for example, a technique used
for demerging and incentives to dismantle a large group of companies are given, as we have
âž¨ See p. 258 seen, by the Companies Acts in terms of share premium (see Chapter 13 âž¨).
An example of a demerger attracting share premium relief appears in Figures 24.1 and 24.2.
The activities of the companies are indicated, as is the holding of H in each.
(a) A allots 1,000 Â£1 ordin ary shares (valued at Â£6.00 per share) to H.
(b) H transfers its 75 per cent holding in B to A.
(c) C allots 1,000 Â£1 ordinary shares (valued at Â£6.00 per share) to H.
(d) H transfers its 65 per cent holding in D to C.
(e) H is then wound up, its holdings in A and C being sold, e.g. by a public placing.
Figure 24.1 Old group structure

Figure 24.2 New demerged structure
Share premium relief: CA 2006, s 611 (formerly CA 1985, s 132)
A and C need only transfer to share premium the â€˜minimum premium valueâ€™. This is the
amount, if any, by which the base values of the shares in B and D exceed the aggregate nominal value of the shares A and C allotted to H.
Base value is the lower of the cost to H of the shares in B and D and the amount at which the
shares of B and D were stated immediately prior to the transfer in the accounting records of H.
(i) Shares in B and C cost H Â£4,000 in each case but stood in the accounting records of H at
Â£3,000: base value Â£3,000.
(ii) Nominal value of shares allotted by A and C was Â£1,000, so minimum premium value is
Â£2,000. This goes to a share premium account in the books of A and C, but not the true
value of the consideration received from B and D by allotting shares to H. The true value,
of course, is the total value of the assets of B and D which could run into many thousands
or millions of pounds.
It should be noted that share premium relief under s 611 is available where the consideration for the issue of the shares consists of any non-cash assetsof the company providing the
consideration and not merely of shares in another subsidiary of the holding company.
Section 942 of the Companies Act 2006 confers certain statutory powers upon the Takeover
Panel but does not seek to regulate the constitution of the Panel itself. The composition of the
Panel is to be found not in the legislation but in the Takeover Code.
This area of corporate activity is covered by the law of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers.
The Panel has been designated as the supervisory authority to carry out certain regulatory
functions in relation to takeovers under the EC Directive on Takeover Bids (2004/25/EC). Its
statutory functions are set out in and under Chapter 1 of Part 28 of the Companies Act 2006.
Additionally, there are now criminal penalties for insider dealing generally and during a
takeover, under the Criminal Justice Act 1993. If applicable, one must also consider The
Unregistered Companies Regulations 2009.
The majority of the rules relating to takeovers are still contained in the Takeover Code,
which was given a statutory basis by Part 28 of the CA 2006 in relation to all offers and other
statutory merger transactions to which it applies. The General Principles and Code Rules were
amended in CA 2006 to implement certain of the provisions of the Takeovers Directive as well

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
as to bring into effect a number of other amendments that had been the subject of a public
consultation process by the Panel and the Code Committee, including the abolition of the
Rules Governing Substantial Acquisitions of Shares (SARs)
Definition
On the assumption that A plc is acquiring B plc, a takeover may be defined as an offer to all
the shareholders of B or one or more classes of shareholders of B, to buy their shares for cash
and/or securities in A, the purpose being that A will obtain control of B. Aâ€™s offer is normally
conditional upon sufficient acceptances to ensure control.
A takeover proper occurs when the directors of B do not support the bid. In such a situation A must deal direct with the shareholders of B. As we have seen, if the directors of B do
support a merger with A, then they can call the necessary meetings and in general terms
organise an amalgamation by methods set out in s 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or the CA
2006, s 895 which have already been dealt with.
Why the City Code?
The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers and the Takeover Panel which administer it provide legal control in regard to some of the following:
(a) The offer document
This is used to convey the offer to the shareholders of the company to be acquired, in this case
B, is a prospectus and governed by the rules of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
and the Stock Exchange Listing requirements.
However, the documents issued by the offeror (or the offeree board, giving, for example,
advice to its members whether or not to accept) are also governed by section J of the City
Code, Rules 23-27. The full details are beyond the scope of a book of this nature. However,
Rule 23 expresses the general standard of care in regard to documents from the offeror and
offeree board as follows:
Shareholders must be given sufficient information and advice to enable them to reach a properly informed decision as to the merits or demerits of an offer. Such information must be available to shareholders early enough to enable them to make a decision in good time. The
obligation of the offeror in these respects towards the shareholders of the offeree company is no
less than an offerorâ€™s obligation towards its own shareholders.
Of major importance is the requirement to give stated financial information about the
offeror company (see Rule 24.2). This includes, for the last three financial years for which
information has been published, turnover, net profit or loss before and after taxation, the
charge for tax, extraordinary items, minority interests, the amount absorbed by dividends and
earnings and dividends per share.
(b) Partial bids
In the absence of the City Code there would be nothing to prevent a company making a
partial bid in order to achieve control of a company â€˜on the cheapâ€™ as it were. It is not in practice necessary to acquire 50 per cent or more of the voting power of a company in order to
control it. The making of partial bids is controlled by the Code and there are provisions under

which a mandatory bid must be made for the remainder of the shares of the company to be
acquired once a certain number of shares in that company has been obtained. These matters
will be considered in more detail later.
(c) Insider dealing
The Code deals with insider trading in quoted companies and the Takeover Panel can publish reprimands in respect of those who deal inside. These are extra-legal sanctions, the
Criminal Justice Act 1993 providing for criminal sanctions. The contribution in this field
made by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 on market abuse under the control of
âž¨ See p. 259 the Financial Services Authority has already been noted (see Chapter 13 âž¨).
(d) Misleading profit forecasts
Directors and other officers of companies do, from time to time, make public statements as
to the future profits of companies which are misleading. The Panel has been active in this area
in requiring the publication of corrections of misleading statements.
In addition, when a forecast of profit before taxation appears in a document addressed to
shareholders, there must be included forecasts of taxation, extraordinary items and minority
interests.
(e) Tactics of directors
The directors of the company to be acquired have in the past used tactics to frustrate the bid and
retain control. The Panel takes action on the basis of the Codeâ€™s general principle 7 which states:
At no time after a bona fide offer has been communicated to the board of the offeree company
or after the board of the offeree company has reason to believe that a bona fide offer might be
imminent may any action be taken by the board of the offeree company in relation to the affairs
of the company, without the approval of the shareholders in general meeting, which could
effectively result in any bona fide offer being frustrated or in the shareholders being denied an
opportunity to decide on its merits.
In the past, directorsâ€™ tactics used to frustrate a bid have often consisted of the issue of
additional shares to a company or person(s) who would not accept the bid, without consulting the shareholders of the victim company as to whether this tactic of the directors was
acceptable. Obviously general principle 7 would apply to such a situation but now the 2006
Act provides, as we have seen, that the authority of the company is required before the allot-
âž¨ See p. 226 ment of certain securities by the directors (see Chapter 11 âž¨). This is reinforced by Rule 21
which carries a similar provision regarding the issue of shares but extends to the making of
other contracts otherwise than in the ordinary course of business.
However, there are some situations where general principle 7 and Rule 21 would be the
only sanction, for example where the directors lease off the companyâ€™s property to put it
beyond the control of the bidder so that he does not continue with his bid. If we assume that
company B, our victim company, owns the freehold of a large block of flats which a bidder
for company B wishes to demolish in order to develop the site, then if the directors of B were
to lease out the block of flats for, say, 99 years, thus preventing the bidder, even if he were successful, from demolishing the premises for that period so that he did not proceed with his bid,
then such a tactic would, unless approved by ordinary resolution of the members, infringe
general principle 7 and Rule 21 and the â€˜proper purposeâ€™ rule and could be the basis of a complaint to the Panel and action by it to prevent infringement of the Code.

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
Statutory Authority of the Panel and the City Code
The Panel is an independent body, established in 1968, whose main functions are to issue
and administer the City Code (sometimes referred to as the Code or the Takeover Code) and
to supervise and regulate takeovers and other matters to which the Code applies in accordance with the rules set out in the Code. It has been designated as the supervisory authority to
carry out certain regulatory functions in relation to takeovers pursuant to the Directive on
Takeover Bids (2004/25/EC) (the â€˜Directiveâ€™). Its statutory functions are set out in and under
ss 942 to 963 of CA 2006. Rules are set out in the Code. Further information relating to the
Panel and the Code can be found on the Panelâ€™s website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk.
In addition, the membership of the Panel covers a wide range of services within the City
and therefore a flagrant flouting of the Code could lead to problems in addition to the loss of
the Stock Exchange market for purchase and sale of securities. The Code is issued on the
authority of the Takeover Panel.
Membership of the Panel
The chairman, deputy chairmen and certain members of the Panel used to be appointed by
the Governor of the Bank of England under earlier editions of the Code, reflecting the historical reality of how the self-regulatory process was initiated. However, the Governor no
longer has a formal role in the Panelâ€™s composition, rather these individuals are appointed by
the Panel itself. In addition, its membership comprises individuals nominated by the following bodies, all of which are committed to support its activities:
The Association of British Insurers;
The Association of Investment Trust Companies;
The Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers;
The British Bankersâ€™ Association;
The Confederation of British Industry;
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales;
The London Investmen t Banking Association (with separate representation for its
Corporate Finance Committee and Securities Trading Committee);
The National Association of Pension Funds;
The Investment Management Association;
London Investment Banking Association Securities Trading Committee.
Each of the bodies listed above may also nominate designated alternates.
In addition, the Panel publishes reprimands which may even appear in the professional
press. The publication of this sort of information should have some effect upon practitioners
for publication leads to knowledge by their colleagues that they have transgressed the ethics
of the Code. Published public reprimands are rare because of the devastating effect such statements may have on companies operating within the financial sector.
It is the nature and purpose of the City Code to ensure that shareholders are treated fairly
and are not denied an opportunity to decide on the merits of a takeover. In particular, shareholders of the same class must be afforded equivalent treatment by an offeror under the City
Code. The City Code however is not concerned with the financial or commercial advantages or disadvantages of a takeover which are matters for the company and its shareholders.
Additionally, competition policy is outside of its remit.

CA 2006, s 952 allows the Panel to impose sanctions on a person who breaches the rules.
These sanctions can be enforced by the Panel seeking enforcement by the court pursuant to
s 955, CA 2006. Hearings and appeals (including the establishment of an independent Takeover
Appeal Board) are provided for in s 951, CA 2006.
Judicial review
In Rv Panel on Takeovers[1987] 1 All ER 564 the Court of Appeal decided that, having regard
to the public consequences of non-compliance with the Code, e.g. that a bid by one company
for another could be declared invalid if the procedures of the Code were infringed, an
application to the High Court to consider a Panel ruling by way of judicial review would be
available in an appropriate case. The courts are not, however, anxious to intervene because
judicial review of a Panel decision introduces an element of delay which is undesirable in
the takeover situation.
All that now remains is to consider some of the major steps in a takeover bid and see how
the various rules of the Code affect the position. In addition, we must give special consideration to the duties of directors in takeovers since this is not only the greatest area of practical
problems but is also most likely to be required for examination purposes.
In all situations company A is attempting to acquire company B.
Secrecy during negotiations: insider dealing
The relevant provisions, which are set out in Rules 2 and 4, are designed to prevent insider
dealing and they are extra-legal in their operation. The legal provisions, under which insider
dealing may, in certain circumstances, be a criminal offence punishable by a fine and/or
âž¨ See p. 259 imprisonment, are set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1993 (see Chapter 13 âž¨).
There are, as we have seen, additional civil sanctions for market abuse in the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 that are administered by the Financial Services Authority.
Rule 2, which is concerned with keeping bids secret before public announcement, states:
â€˜The vital importance of absolute secrecy before an announcement must be emphasised.â€™
Rule 4, which is concerned with dealings before and during the offer, requires all persons
who have confidential price-sensitive information concerning an offer or contemplated offer
to treat it as secret and not pass it on to anyone else unless it is necessary to do so, as where
it is part of a personâ€™s work to pass it on as, for example, by one member of an audit team to
another as part of the audit function.
Additionally, there must not be dealings in securities of the offeree or the offeror company by persons (other than the offeror) who have price-sensitive information prior to the
announcement of an approach by a bidder, or an actual bid, or of the termination of negotiations. Dealing is allowed in the shares of the offeror company where the bid will not
significantly affect the value of the offerorâ€™s shares, which may often be the case. It is the
shares of the offeree company which are most likely to be affected by a bid.
If those involved in the negotiations feel that secrecy cannot be maintained, they should
ask the Stock Exchange for a temporary halt in dealings.
Failure to comply with Rules 2 and 4 may result in a reprimand from the Panel which may
be published.

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
The rules of the Code are now preventive and information suggesting that insider
dealing has taken place which might be revealed by dealings on the Stock Exchange would
be passed by the Stock Exchange and by the Panel to the Financial Services Authority for
investigation.
Offer document and response of offeree board
The rules derive from section J (consisting of Rules 23-27) of the City Code. It is worth
referring again to the general object of the detailed contents of the offer document and any
documents issued by the offeree board which is stated in Rule 23.
More important than the contents of the offer document is what an individual shareholder
can do if he is misled by the contents of the offer document. While accepting that this branch
of the law is not well developed, the judgment of Brightman J in Gething v Kilner [1972]
1 WLR 337 would seem to justify the following statement:
If an offer document or a recommendation circulated by the directors of the offeree company contains a false or misleading statement made knowingly, or presumably, if such a
document omits information known to the persons issuing it which the law or good practice
requires it to contain, any shareholder of the class to whom the bid is addressed may apply
to the court for an injunction to restrain the offeror from proceeding with the bid or declaring
it unconditional.
Partial offers and mandatory offers
In this connection a knowledge of Rule 36 (partial offers) and Rule 9 (mandatory offers) is of
importance. However, before considering the rules relating to partial offers which can result
in a bidder obtaining control of a company â€˜on the cheapâ€™, as it were, the nature of a partial
bid should be understood. If we take three shareholders of the target company and their
holdings to be Mr A (100 shares), Mr B (50 shares), and Mr C (40 shares), then a 50 per cent
partial bid will involve, for example, an offer to take 50 of Aâ€™s shares, 25 of Bâ€™s shares, and
20 of Câ€™s. When this sort of bid is being contemplated, Rule 36 must be followed. Under the
rule the Panelâ€™s consent is required for any partial offer.
In addition, the following subrules of Rule 36 should be noted.
In the case of an offer which would result in the offeror holding shares carrying less
than 30 per cent of the voting rights of a company, consent will normally be granted (Rule
Any offer which would result in the offeror holding shares carrying 30 per cent or more
of the voting rights of a company must normally be conditional, not only on the relevant
number of acceptances being received, but also on approval of the offer, normally signified
by means of a separate box on the Form of Acceptance and Transfer, being given by shareholders holding 50 per cent of the voting rights not held by the offeror and persons acting in
concert with it. This requirement may on occasion be waived if over 50 per cent of all voting
rights of the offeree company are held by the shareholder (Rule 36.5).
Where an offer is made for a company with more than one class of equity share capital
which would result in the offeror holding shares carrying 30 per cent or more of the voting
rights, a comparable offer must be made for each class (Rule 36.8).
In connection with mandatory offers, the following subrules of Rules 2 and 9 should

Mandatory offers
A mandatory bid must be made unless the Panel gives its consent:
â— by a person who acquires whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not
shares which taken together with shares held or acquired by persons acting in concert with
him carry 30 per cent or more of the voting rights of the company;
â— by a person who together with people acting in concert with him holds not less than 30 per
cent but not more than 50 per cent of the voting rights of a company if there is any increase
at allin the percentage level of that holding.
Previously in such situations a person or a group acting in concert could acquire in any
12-month period additional shares carrying up to 1 per cent of the voting rights without
making a general offer for the company. The change was made following criticism of the
ability of a person or concert party to achieve control over a period of time without making a
formal bid as where the holding was, say, 48 per cent and the 1 per cent acquisitions eventually brought over 50 per cent and thereby basic control.
The second rule is to deal with persons who have made a bid that has failed to achieve
control but which has left the bidder with, say, a 35 per cent holding. Although the City Code
consists of extra-legal rules, the High Court applied the 30 per cent mandatory bid rule in
effect by the decision in Philip Morris Products Incv Rothmans International Enterprises Ltd
(No 2)(2000) The Times, 10 August.
Immediately upon an acquisition of shares which gives rise to an obligation to make
an offer under this rule, the offeror shall make an announcement of its offer giving the information required by the Code. The announcement of an offer under this rule should include
confirmation by a financial adviser or other appropriate independent party that resources are
available to the offeror sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the offer (Rule 2.5(c)).
An important exception to the requirement to make a mandatory bid occurs when there is
a rescue operation. If company B is in financial difficulties but company A is willing to invest
in the share capital of B in order to save it, then if A takes an issue of shares in B which gives
A, say, 35 per cent of the share capital of B, the Panel will consider waiving the mandatory bid
requirement for the rest of Bâ€™s shares.
Except with the consent of the Panel, no nominee of the offeror or persons acting in concert with it shall be appointed to the board of the offeree company, nor shall the offeror and
persons acting in concert with it transfer, or exercise the votes attaching to, any shares in the
offeree company, until the offer document has been posted (Rule 9.7).
The Code defines â€˜acting in concertâ€™ as follows: â€˜Persons acting in concert comprise persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal), actively
co-operate, through the acquisition by any of them of shares in a company, to obtain or consolidate control of that company.â€™
Then follows a list of persons who will be presumed to be persons acting in concert with
others in the same category unless the contrary is established. These include a company, its
parent, subsidiaries, and fellow-subsidiaries, and their associated companies.
For this purpose, ownership or control of 20 per cent or more of the equity share capital
of the company will be regarded as a test of associated company status. Other persons presumed to be acting in concert are a company with any of its directors (together with their
close relatives and related trusts); a company with any of its pension funds; a person with
any investment company, unit trust or other funds whose investments such person manages

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
on a discretionary basis; a financial adviser with his client where the financial adviser
has shares in the client company; and finally, directors of a company which is subject to an
offer or where the directors have reason to believe a bona fide offer for their company may
be imminent.
It should be noted that although an interest of under 30 per cent does not constitute
control in the Takeover Panelâ€™s eyes, the Office of Fair Trading may take the view that it
could constitute a merger giving the Office of Fair Trading power to make a reference to the
Competition Commission with a view to preventing the takeover going ahead if it is thought
by the Competition Commission to be undesirable in the public interest. The relevant provisions are contained in the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002.
Compulsory acquisition
CA 2006, s 979 (formerly CA 1985, s 429) is a section which can be used but only by a corporate bidder who has made a bid to acquire compulsorily the shares of a small minority who
have not accepted the offer. The provisions of the section are as follows:
(a) Where A already has not more than 10 per cent of B or no holdings in B at all, then if
90 per cent of Bâ€™s shareholders, or other shareholders, have accepted the offer within
four months A may within two months after the reaching of the 90 per cent threshold
serve a notice on dissentients that it intends to acquire their shares. The dissentients have
six weeks from the date on which the notice was given to appeal to the court. If there is
no appeal or the court does not order otherwise, A acquires the shares.
(b) Where A has more than 10 per cent of B, then under s 979 of the 2006 Act, threequarters in number and 90 per cent in value of Bâ€™s other shareholders must accept within
four months of the offer.
The court will seldom interfere if the offer is fair but will not allow the section to be used
for improper purposes such as the expulsion of a minority.
Re Bugle Press Ltd[1960] 3 All ER 791
Holders of 90 per cent of the shares in a company formed a new company which made an offer
for the shares of the old company. As was to be expected, 90 per cent of the shareholders
accepted the offer and the new company then served notice on the holder of the other 10 per cent
of the shares stating that it wished to purchase his holding.
Held- by the Court of Appeal - that in substance the new company was the same as the majority shareholders, and the scheme was in effect an expropriation of the minority interest. â€˜What the
section is directed to is a case where there is a scheme or contract for the acquisition of a company, its amalgamation, re-organisation or the like, and where the offeror is independent of the
shareholders in the transferor company, or at least independent of that part or fraction of them
from which the 90 per cent is to be derived.â€™ PerEvershed MR.
The High Court (affirmed by the Court of Appeal) has ruled that CA 2006, s 979 allows
a bidder who holds 90 per cent in value of the shares in the victim following a bid to compulsorily acquire the shares of the remaining members even though they did not receive the
offer documents.

In Re Joseph Holt plc Winpar Holdings Ltdv Joseph Holt Group plc[2000] 97
(44) LSG 44. Appeal case available at www.lawtel.com, under Case Law-CO100109
In March 2000, Inhoco 1849 plc, now the Joseph Holt Group plc, announced that it was making
an offer to acquire all the issued share capital of Joseph Holt plc. The offer document was sent to
most of Joseph Holt plcâ€™s existing shareholders, and an advertisement was placed in the London
edition of the Financial Times. The offer document was not sent to shareholders whose addresses
were in Australia, Canada, Japan or the USA because complying with the securities laws of those
countries was difficult and costly.
By April 2000, Joseph Holt Group plc had received acceptances which, together with the
shares it already held, amounted to over 90 per cent in value of Joseph Holt plc.
Notices of compulsory acquisition under s 429(1) were sent to the remaining shareholders.
Once notices are sent, the bidder is entitled to, and must, acquire the outstanding shareholdings
under s 430(2).
A s 429(1) notice was sent to Winpar Holdings Ltd in Australia. The company objected on the
ground that the notice was invalid since it had not received the offer documents.
The High Court ruled (later affirmed by the Court of Appeal) that the offer was to acquire all the
shares as required by s 428. The fact that the offer was not communicated to a particular shareholder was not fatal to the offer and the subsequent proceedings under s 429(1). For the compulsory acquisition procedure to apply, it was necessary only that an offer for all the shares was made:
it was not necessary that such an offer was received by or known to a particular shareholder. The
offer made by Joseph Holt Group related to Winparâ€™s shares, even though Winpar was not aware
of it. The offer documentation was a general and not a limited process, and in addition the offer
did not exclude the shares of those resident in Australia. The s 429(1) notice to Winpar was therefore valid and the compulsory purchase procedure applied to its shares.
Transfer of the acquired shares is effected by an instrument of transfer executed on behalf of the
shareholder by a person appointed by the offeror (CA 2006, s 981).
Reverse acquisitio n
This is a takeover method used by a private company to go public without undertaking all the
regulatory hurdles that going public usually requires. The private company acquires majority
ownership in a publicly listed company that has no assets or liabilities (called a shell), changes
the companyâ€™s name, and installs its management and board of directors.
Directorsâ€™ duties in a takeover by general offer
Suppose that in a bid situation the directors bargain for additional payments to themselves,
what can the other shareholders do?
Apart from the provisions of the City Code, if the directors of B retire from office â€˜golden
handshakesâ€™ are covered by the Companies Acts and such sums are held in trust for those
shareholders who sold their shares as a result of the offer, if the payments were not disclosed
and approved by ordinary resolution of the members.
If they do not retire, the Companies Acts do not apply and additional payments made to
directors are not recoverable. Thus if no change is made in the directorship but, for example,
the board are paid Â£100,000 to persuade them to recommend the offer to the other shareholders,

Chapter 24 Amalgamations, reconstructions and takeovers
or are paid an increased price for their shares because they hold a large block, it seems there
can be no recovery under the Acts.
It will be apparent, therefore, that there are situations in which the directors, in connection
with a takeover bid, may receive additional payments without being liable to account for them
under the statute.
The Code also applies and provides that unless the Panel consents the offeror, or persons
acting in concert, may not make arrangements to deal or buy or sell shares of the offeree company during an offer or when one is in contemplation, if those arrangements have attached to
them favourable conditions not being extended to all shareholders.
The City Code and the supervision of the Panel should in most cases prevent this occurring in the case of public companies but it could still occur in the case of private ones where
in fact some of the worst abuses have occurred in the past. Where a private company is
concerned or, in the case of a public company if the Panel is not effective, the most hopeful
line, in terms of getting the money back from the directors, is to allege a breach of their
fiduciary duties towards the company. The general equitable principle exemplified in Regal
âž¨ See p. 379 (Hastings) Ltd vGulliver, 1942 (see Chapter 19 âž¨) could apply. However, the action is not
straightforward because the wrong covered in that case is basically one to the company and
payments made to directors to secure favourable recommendation to the shareholders in
a bid situation seem merely to be a payment to them in their capacity as directors, no corporate action being involved, though the extra money received is, of course, an undisclosed
benefit or profit from office and is recoverable by the company on the basis of a breach of
fiduciary duty.
However, it is somewhat futile to allow the company to recover in cases where those who
are really wronged are the other shareholders who have sold. The Companies Act provides
that moneys paid as a result of retirement are held on trust for the shareholders but the judgemade equitable rules as seen in the Regal case do not necessarily extend to shareholders.
Presumably, the s 175 CA 2006 which codifies the duties of a director to avoid conflicts of
interest such as misuse of corporate opportunities for personal gain might now replace the
general equitable principle stated in Regal.
Dealings in shares during offer period
Another problem which can arise if the directors have been offered incentives to recommend
a bid is that the bid price for the shares may be lower than it should be. Where this is so, the
offeror company (A) may, in order to enhance its chances of successful control, purchase
shares in B on the market at a price higher than the bid price.
Since it is not desirable to fetter the market in shares, Rule 8.1 of the Code provides that
dealings in relevant securities by the parties to a takeover and by any associates, for their own
account, or the account of discretionary investment clients, must be disclosed daily to the
Stock Exchange (Company Announcements Office), the Panel and the press (discretionary)
not later than 12 noon on the business day following the date of the transaction. Such disclosures must state the total of all relevant securities of any offeror or the offeree company purchased or sold on any day during the offer period, in the market or otherwise, and the prices
paid or received.
In this connection, Rule 6.2 provides that if the offeror or persons acting in concert
purchase securities during the offer period at above the offer price, then it shall increase its
offer to not less than the highest price paid for the securities so acquired. Rule 7.1 provides

Essay questions
that an announcement of any such purchase and the consequent increased offer must be
made immediately.
The Code provides that a person with a significant commercial interest in the outcome of
an offer should not, without the consent of the Panel, deal in the shares of an offeror or an
offeree company during an offer period.
Recent amendments and developments
The Code was amended on 14 January 2008 to cover transactions implemented by way of a
scheme including the addition of a new Appendix 7 to the Code explaining how the provisions of the Code apply to schemes (and listing those which do not apply where a scheme is
used). Rule 26 of the Code (documents on display) was amended on 25 January 2010 (among
other things) to provide that all documents required by that Rule to be put on display should
also be available for inspection on a website.
On 1 July 2009, legislation was put in place in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, putting
the Takeover Panelâ€™s regulation of takeovers and mergers of companies registered in those
jurisdictions on a statutory footing. As a result, the Takeover Panel now has powers and duties
in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man equivalent to those imposed on and granted to it
in the UK by the Companies Acts 2006.
Two important changes were made to the Codeâ€™s disclosure rules which came into effect
on 19 April 2010: (a) first, to require that a person subject to the Codeâ€™s disclosure regime
(including a person with a gross long interest of 1 per cent or more in any relevant securities
of any party to an offer, other than a cash offeror) should disclose his long interests and short
positions in relevant securities of an offeree company by no later than the tenth business day
after the commencement of the offer period (and, in the case of a securities exchange offer, in
relevant securities of the offeror by no later than the tenth business day after the announcement that first identifies it as an offeror), regardless of whether he has dealt in the relevant
securities of the party concerned (the â€˜opening position disclosureâ€™ requirement); and (b)
secondly, to require that a person who has a gross long interest of 1 per cent or more in any
relevant securities of a party to an offer (other than a cash offeror) should disclose any dealing by him in any relevant securities of any party to the offer (other than a cash offeror) - i.e.
not only dealings in relevant securities of the party to the offer in which he has a gross long
interest of 1 per cent or more; and also that any person making a disclosure under the Code
should disclose details of all his long interests and short positions in relevant securities of all
parties to the offer (other than a cash offeror) - i.e. not only the party to the offer in whose
relevant securities the dealing occurred (the â€˜extended composite disclosureâ€™ requirement).

Corporate insolvency - company rescue

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
In this chapter we shall consider those aspects of insolvency law which are designed to rescue
the company and prevent winding-up.
Voluntary arrangements
Sections 1 to 7 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provide for a type of voluntary arrangement which
is concerned to prevent a company from being wound up. In general terms, a CVA is a contract made between the company and its creditors. The contract freezes the existing debts at
an agreed date. The company carries on trading and pays a monthly amount into the CVA
over an agreed period, usually of three to five years. The CVA allows the company to go on
trading but enables the creditors to receive at least a part of their debt.
When interpreting the terms of a CVA contract, courts generally opt for an interpretation
that supports the CVA. However, a court may adopt an approach that may not be convenient
for the supervisors if that is the proper interpretation of what the parties agreed. See, for
instance, In Re Energy Holdings (No.3) Ltd (In Liquidation)[2010] EWHC 788 (Ch) in which
the court held that the supervisors must apply the terms of the CVA and thus not leave the
creditorâ€™s claim in limbo and lacking an effective right of appeal. Here the supervisorsâ€™ excessive delay from leaving these claims unadjudicated cost them dearly! They were ordered to
pay both sidesâ€™ costs of the applications on an indemnity basis.
The companyâ€™s directors can initiate formal proposals for a voluntary arrangement at any
time and the company need not actually be insolvent though it often will be, or at any rate
close to it. Once a winding-up begins or an administration order is made (see below), the
directors can no longer initiate a scheme, though the initiative may come in such a case from
the liquidator or the administrator.
In fact, in general terms a voluntary arrangement will be much more likely to succeed if
it is put forward by an administrator after an administration order has been made since
as we shall see the suspension of creditorsâ€™ rights which occurs in an administration will give
the administrator/nominee (see below) a better chance to put together a fully considered
The proposals will be similar to those which must be referred to the court under Part 26 of
the Companies Act 2006, e.g. creditors agreeing to take, say, 50 pence in the pound. The
Insolvency Act 1986 provides a simpler approach to the 2006 Act, though that section remains
available for major reconstructions for which it is more appropriate.
In this regard, the High Court has approved as a voluntary arrangement a proposal by
a company to pay nil pence in the pound to its preferential and other unsecured creditors
(see IRCv Adams and Partners Ltd[1999] 2 BCLC 730). Creditor approval was given to the
scheme because it gave a better return to the Bank of Scotland plc which held a fixed and floating charge over the assets. The Revenue, as a preferential creditor, challenged the arrangement
on the basis that it was not an arrangement permitted by the 1986 Act but its claim failed.
The Revenue might have fared better if it had brought a claim under s 6 of the 1986 Act on
the basis that the arrangement was â€˜unfairly prejudicialâ€™ to it. However, such a claim must be
brought within 28 days of the results of the creditorsâ€™ meeting being reported to the court
and the Revenue had left it too late for this. The Revenue could only challenge it on the basis
that it was an arrangement of a type not permitted by the Act, and on this contention the
Revenue failed.

Voluntary arrangements
The nominee
The directors must appoint a nominee, though in an administration or liquidation the
administrator or liquidator will act as nominee. The nominee must be an authorised licensed
insolvency practitioner.
Certain professional bodies recognised by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation
and Skills (Secretary of State) may authorise their members to act as insolvency practitioners.
The bodies currently recognised for England and Wales are: The Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants, The Insolvency Practitionersâ€™ Association, The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, and The Law Society. Persons not authorised by a professional body may apply to the Secretary of State for authorisation. The relevant professional
association is the Insolvency Practitioners Association.
In this connection, s 4 of the Insolvency Act 2000 authorises persons other than licensed
insolvency practitioners (IPs) to act as nominees or supervisors of company (or individual)
voluntary arrangements, provided that such persons are members of bodies that are recognised by the Secretary of State. The change seems designed to let in members of bodies such
as the R3, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals, and other turnaround specialists and maybe to provide more competition in the market where there are only some 1,200
IPs at present taking appointments.
The nominee will investigate the scheme and report to the court, within 28 days after he is
given notice of the proposed scheme, as to whether the scheme is likely to be viable so that
meetings of members and creditors should be called to approve it. If the nominee is already
an administrator or liquidator, there is no need to report to the court. Unless the court orders
otherwise, where a report is made to it, the nominee will order meetings of creditors and members to be called to consider the proposals for a voluntary arrangement and to approve it.
In order to assist him with his report, he is entitled to a statement of affairs from the
directors. Where a nominee is required to report to the court, he must state in his report
whether in his opinion the proposed company voluntary arrangement (CVA) has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented (Insolvency Act 2000, Sch 2). As we have
seen, such a report is not necessary where the nominee is an administrator or liquidator.
Approval of scheme: by members and creditors
Approval requires a simple majority in value of the members voting in person or by proxy
(or by written resolution) and a three-quarters majority in value of creditors voting in person
or by proxy at a creditorsâ€™ meeting. Every creditor of the company of whose claim and address
the nominee is aware is entitled to attend.
A resolution will fail if at the creditorsâ€™ meeting more than half in value of the creditors
who are not connected with the company, i.e. who are not director creditors or directorsâ€™
relatives who are creditors, vote against it.
If the meetings approve the arrangement, it becomes binding on all ordinary creditors, but
not on preferred or secured creditors, unless they agree, who can pursue their claims against
the company.
In Re Cancol Ltd[1996] 1 BCLC 100 the High Court decided that a person who was entitled to a future or contingently payable debt such as future payments of rent to fall due
under an existing lease was a â€˜creditorâ€™ for the purposes of insolvency legislation and was
bound by a company voluntary arrangement approved at a meeting of creditors of which he
had notice and at which he was entitled to vote.

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
The approval of the scheme is reported to the court which may discharge an administration order or a winding-up order.
The decision in Re Cancol(1996) is now reinforced by the Insolvency Act 2000 which provides that a CVA will bind all of the companyâ€™s creditors, including unknown creditors, who
are then able to claim from the company only the dividends they would have received if they
had come to light after the CVA had been completed. Such creditors may also make an application to the court on the ground that their interests are unfairly prejudiced by the voluntary
arrangement that is approved (see Sch 2, paras 6 and 7). Preferential creditors retain their
priority, of course, and secured creditors will rely on their security unless they have consented
to surrender it to the company and become ordinary creditors when the above provisions of
the IA 2000 will apply if, for example, they fail to attend a meeting and vote even where no
notice was given.
It is an offence under the IA 2000 for an officer of a company to try to obtain approval of
the members or creditors to a proposed CVA by making a false representation or fraudulently doing or failing to do anything (Sch 2, paras 8 and 12). The nominee or supervisor is
required under para 10 of Sch 2 to report suspected offences to the Secretary of State. The
Secretary of State is granted powers to investigate such suspected offences (para 10).
Dissentients
Dissenting members and creditors may apply to the court to set aside the scheme on the
grounds of unfair prejudice or material irregularity. This must be done within 28 days of the
nominee reporting the approval of the scheme to the court. The time limit cannot be extended.
The High Court considered the phrase â€˜material irregularityâ€™ in In re Trident Fashions plc
[2004] The Times, 23 April. The application was brought against the companyâ€™s three joint
administrators and the company which employed them. The material irregularity relied on
was the failure by one of the administrators to disclose to the meeting the existence of certain
offers to purchase the company. It appeared that at the meeting the administrator concerned
mentioned only one formal offer without saying that there had been two other offers as well.
The judge concluded from this that there had been a relevant irregularity. However, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Cadbury Schweppes plcv Somji[2001] 1 WLR 615 had to be
looked at. It laid down a test in this sort of case which was that if the truth had been told
at the meeting it would be likely to have made a material difference to the way in which the
creditors would have assessed the terms of the proposed voluntary arrangement: was there a
substantial chance that the creditors would not have approved the arrangement? The fact that
the meeting might have been adjourned for a few days was not enough. The judge said that in
the circumstances it was unlikely that the meeting would have been adjourned but even if it
had been adjourned for a few days there was no real prospect that it would have affected the
approval of the voluntary arrangement. On the matter of omission of material at the meeting
the court could interfere with the arrangement only if the omission was one which no reasonable practitioner would have made. The creditorsâ€™ application was dismissed.
Approval by creditors only
A decision by the creditorsâ€™ meeting to approve a proposed CVA will prevail where this
conflicts with the decision made by a meeting of the company, subject to the right of a member
to challenge this on an application to the court (Insolvency Act 2000, Sch 2, para 5).

Voluntary arrangements
If the scheme proceeds
If the scheme proceeds beyond the above stages, the nominee becomes the supervisor and
implements the scheme. At any stage in the implementation of the scheme, and as it proceeds,
the creditors can challenge the supervisorâ€™s decisions in front of the court and, equally, the
supervisor may ask the court for directions.
Subsequent liquidation
In Re Arthur Rathbone Kitchens Ltd[1997] 2 BCLC 280 the High Court ruled that s 84 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 (circumstances in which a company may be wound up voluntarily)
allowed members of the company to resolve that the company be wound up voluntarily even
though the directors had proposed an approved voluntary arrangement that was still in
progress or capable of fulfilment or not, even though this might mean that the members had
broken the terms of the arrangement.
Here the decision of the High Court in Re Brelec Installations Ltd (2000) The Times,
18 April, is of interest. BI had entered into a â€˜trading outâ€™ voluntary arrangement whereby
regular payments of a set amount were paid to the supervisors over a fixed period. Some six
months later the company failed to pay its debts as they fell due and later went into liquidation. The issue between the supervisors and liquidator was the monies paid by the company
to the supervisors prior to the liquidation. Was it available to the supervisors or the liquidator? The court ruled in favour of the supervisors. It was not appropriate to scrutinise the
companyâ€™s trading to determine when default first occurred so as to pinpoint the date from
which payments to the supervisors were to be regarded as held for the benefit of the company
rather than for the arrangement. The monies received by the supervisors prior to the liquidation remained subject to the trusts of the voluntary arrangement.
The High Court also ruled in Re Kudos Glass Ltd (in liquidation)[2001] 1 BCLC 390 that
sums held by the supervisor of a creditorsâ€™ voluntary arrangement are in the event of a compulsory winding-up order made in regard to a non-CVA debt held by the supervisor on trust
solely for the CVA creditors. The court ruled that if the petitioner had been the supervisor or
a CVA creditor, it would have found that the petitioner had elected to end the scheme and the
funds would be transferred to the liquidator.
Small companies: a CVA with a moratorium option
The following provisions of the Insolvency Act 2000 are relevant. Section 1 introduces Sch 1
to the Act, which makes the option of applying for a short moratorium of 28 days available to
a small company where its directors intend to put a proposal to the companyâ€™s creditors for
a company voluntary arrangement.
Small companies are not obliged to use this procedure but can proceed under the standard
procedure if they wish.
Eligible companies
To be eligible a company must satisfy twoor more of the conditions for being a small company within s 247(3) of the CA 1985 (repealed and replaced by Companies Act 2006, ss 382
and 465 consolidating). Certain other companies that are involved in financial markets where
the modifications to former law are designed to ensure that financial markets continue to

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
function in the event of the insolvency of one of the participants are also included. Those ineligible are companies that are subject to formal insolvency proceedings, as where a windingup is in progress, or where in the previous 12 months a moratorium has failed.
Nomineeâ€™s statement
Directors who want a moratorium must provide information to the nominee as follows:
â— a document setting out the terms of the proposed CVA;
â— a document giving details of the companyâ€™s assets, debts and other liabilities, together with
any other information that the nominee may request.
Given that the nominee considers that the proposal has a reasonable prospect of success in
terms of being approved and implemented and that sufficient funding is available and that
meetings of the company and creditors should be held, he must provide the directors with a
statement to that effect. In reaching conclusions, the nominee may rely on the information
provided by the directors unless he has reason to believe it may be inaccurate.
Documents to be submitted to the court
In order to obtain a moratorium, the directors must file certain documents with the court.
These are set out in Sch 1, para 7 and include the terms of the proposed CVA and a statement
of the companyâ€™s affairs.
Duration of moratorium
Schedule 1, para 8 deals with this and provides that the moratorium will come into force when
the documents referred to above are filed with the court. The maximum initial moratorium
is 28 days. This period can be extended or reduced by order of the Secretary of State. A meeting of the company and creditors held within the initial period may decide to extend the
moratorium by up to a further two months. The Secretary of State may by order increase or
decrease that period of two months. The moratorium may be brought to an end by a decision
of the meetings of creditors and company to approve a CVA. Alternatively, it may be brought
to an end:
â— by the court;
â— by the nomineeâ€™s withdrawal of his consent to act;
â— by a decision of meetings of creditors and the company other than to approve a CVA;
â— at the end of the 28-day minimum period if bothof the first meetings of the company and
creditors have not taken place;
â— if there is no decision of the above meetings to extend it.
Notification of the beginning of the moratorium
The directors have a duty to inform the nominee that a moratorium has come into force.
When a moratorium comes into force and when it ends, the nominee must advertise that fact
and notify the Registrar of Companies and the company. When the moratorium comes into
force, he must also notify any creditor who has petitioned for a winding-up and, when it ends,
any creditor of whose claim he is aware.
Effect of moratorium on creditors
Except for an â€˜excepted petitionâ€™, i.e. a petition by the Secretary of State that winding-up is in
the public interest under s 124A of the IA 1986, no petition to wind up the company can be

Voluntary arrangements
commenced nor can any other insolvency proceedings. No steps may be taken to enforce
any security over the companyâ€™s property or repossess any goods in the companyâ€™s possession
under any hire-purchase agreement, nor can any other proceedings, execution or other legal
process be commenced or continued, or distraint, e.g. by a landlord, be levied. No meeting of
the company may be held or requisitioned without the consent of the nominee or of the court.
Winding-up petitions presented prior to the moratorium are stayed during the period but
not â€˜public policyâ€™ petitions which continue unaffected.
Section 127 of the IA 1986 rendering void dispositions of the companyâ€™s property after presentation of a winding-up petition does not apply.
Securities given during the moratorium
These are unenforceable unless given with reasonable grounds that they would benefit the
Company invoices
All invoices and orders and letters where the name of the company appears must give the
name of the nominee and state that a moratorium is in force. The officers of the company
commit an offence if this provision is breached in the absence of reasonable excuse.
Obtaining credit
During the moratorium the company may not obtain credit to the value of Â£250 or more
without first telling the person giving the credit that a moratorium is in force. This includes
payments in advance for the supply of goods and services. There are criminal penalties on the
companyâ€™s officers for breach.
Disposals and payments
While the moratorium is in force the company may only dispose of any of its property or pay
a debt that existed at the start of the moratorium if there are reasonable grounds for believing that it will benefit the company and the moratorium committee gives approval. If there is
no committee, approval must be given by the nominee. There is nothing to prevent the sale
of property in the ordinary course of business as where, for example, a farming supplies company sells a tractor as part of its retail trade. Again, officers of the company commit an offence
on breach.
Disposal of charged property
The Schedule allows the disposal by the company during the moratorium of charged property and any goods in its possession under an HP agreement, provided the holder of the
security or the owner agrees. The holder of a fixed charge and the owner of goods on HP are
entitled to have the proceeds of sale applied to repayment of the loan or debt but the holder
of a floating charge retains a charge of equal priority to his original charge over the proceeds
of the sale or disposal of the charged property.
Monitoring of companyâ€™s activities
The Schedule imposes a duty on the nominee to monitor the companyâ€™s affairs during
the moratorium in order to form a judgment as to the viability of a CVA and the companyâ€™s
ability to carry on during the moratorium. The directors have a duty to provide the nominee
with information.

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
Withdrawal of consent to act by nominee
The Schedule provides that a nominee may withdraw his consent to act if:
â— he considers that the CVA proposal (or modifications communicated to him) no longer
has a reasonable prospect of being approved or implemented; or
â— he considers that the company has insufficient funds now and during the moratorium to
enable it to continue in business throughout the moratorium; or
â— he becomes aware that on the date of filing the company was not eligible for a moratorium; or
â— the directors are not providing him with relevant information on request.
On withdrawal of the nomineeâ€™s consent, the moratorium ends. The above are the only
grounds on which the nominee may withdraw his consent and he must give notice to various
parties, i.e. the court, the Registrar of Companies, the company and creditors of whom he is
aware. He commits an offence by not doing so.
Challenging the nomineeâ€™s actions
Any creditor, director or member of the company or any other person affected by the moratorium who is not satisfied by any decision or act of the nominee may apply to the court for
relief. The court may confirm, reverse or modify any such decision or act and give directions
to the nominee or make any order it sees fit either during or after the moratorium.
Where the acts of the nominee have caused the company loss and the company appears not
to be taking any action, creditors may apply to the court which, if it thinks that the acts of the
nominee were unreasonable, may order the company to make a claim against the nominee or
authorise a creditor to do so.
Replacement of the nominee by the court
Where it is, for example, impracticable or inappropriate for the nominee to continue, the
court may direct that the nominee be replaced by a qualified person who consents.
Summoning of meetings and their conduct
Schedule 1, paras 27 and 28 deal with this and provide, among other things, that the nominee
may call meetings of credi tors and of the company whenever he sees fit.
These meetings decide whether or not to approve the proposed CVA with or without
modification. These modifications may not affect the rights of secured creditors or preferential creditors unless they consent.
Moratorium committee
In a case where the moratorium is extended, there is provision for the setting up of a moratorium committee to exercise functions conferred on it by the meetings referred to above. The
meetings must approve an estimate of the committee expenses.
Members and creditors: conflicting decisions
If the decisions of the members and creditors are conflicting, the decision of the creditors prevails
but a member may apply to the court for an order that the membersâ€™ decision should prevail.
Effect of the CVA
The CVA, when approved, binds all creditors of the company including unknown creditors.
That includes those creditors who, having followed the insolvency rules, were not served with
notice of the relevant meeting(s). Such persons can apply to the court on the grounds of

Voluntary arrangements
unfair prejudice and the court may, for example, revoke or suspend the approval of the CVA.
Otherwise, these creditors are entitled to the dividends payable under the arrangement only.
On approval of the CVA, the nominee becomes the supervisor.
Challenge of directorsâ€™ actions during the moratorium
Any member or creditor can apply to the court for relief on the grounds that the directors are
acting in a way unfairly prejudicial to the interests of creditors or members. The court may
make an order regulating matters or bring the moratorium to an end. This form of action
applies in relation to the acts of directors during the moratorium. The application may be
made during or after the moratorium. If made afterwards, the courtâ€™s order will be to regulate matters and obviously not to bring the moratorium to an end.
Offences by officers of the company
The Schedule provides that if during the 12 months prior to the start of the moratorium an
officer of the company has committed certain acts, e.g. fraudulently removed the companyâ€™s
property worth Â£500 or more or falsified the companyâ€™s records in relation to its property, he
commits an offence, as does an officer who so acts during the moratorium.
It is also an offence for an officer of the company to try to obtain a moratorium or an
extension of it by making false statements or fraudulently doing or not doing anything.
Void provisions in floating charge documents
Schedule 1 provides that any provision in a floating charge is invalid if the charge is to crystallise
(and therefore become a fixed charge) on the obtaining of, or any action to obtain, a moratorium.
The remainder of the Schedule makes consequential amendments to various parts of the
IA 1986, e.g. so that suppliers of gas, water and electricity are not permitted to require a nominee to pay outstanding debts for supply as a condition for supply during the moratorium.
There is also a provision that the relevant date for determining preferential claims is the date
on which the moratorium comes into force.
Trading with companies that are in a CVA
It is not unusual for creditors to carry on trading with a CVA company. Any new debts will
not be covered by the CVA and become, in effect, new liabilities of the CVA company. There
are, of course, some concerns about a continuation of trade since, if the company cannot meet
its CVA requirements, it will almost certainly be forced into liquidation and the new liabilities, if not paid, may not be met. Set out below are some precautions that a creditor can take
in such circumstances:
â— where goods are supplied a retention of title clause could be used in the contract of supply
to ensure that the seller retains ownership of the goods until they are paid for and if they
are still in stock;
â— the contract of sale could require cash on delivery;
â— an attempt should be made to obtain personal guarantees of the new liabilities from the
directors;
â— ascertain from the CVA supervisor whether or not the company is up to date with its payments under the CVA;
â— it is obviously not wise to carry on trading on the old terms; the terms of trade should be
renegotiated.

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
Following the implementation of the Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2010, Companies
House prescribes the use of the following Insolvency forms within Registrarâ€™s Rules for the
first time. The forms listed below are to be filed with the Registrar, for all corporate voluntary
arrangements:
1 Notice to Registrar of Companies of voluntary arrangement taking effect;
2 Notice to Registrar of Companies of order of revocation or suspension of voluntary
arrangement;
3 Notice to Registrar of Companies of supervisorâ€™s progress report; and
4 Notice to Registrar of Companies of completion or termination of voluntary arrangement.
The initiation or termination of insolvency procedures involving a European company (SE),
or any decision to continue operating the SE, must be notified to Companies House on Form
Administration
The current law concerning administration was introduced with effect from 15 September
2003. Under this regime, a company will usually be described as being â€˜in administrationâ€™ -
under the old regime a company would be described as subject to an â€˜administration orderâ€™.
Administratorâ€™s functions
The functions of an administrator are now contained in Insolvency Act 1986, Sch B1, para 3
(as inserted by Enterprise Act 2002 Part 10). The administrator now has the function of
carrying out a single statutory purpose, that is:
â— to rescue the company as a going concern;
â— if this is not reasonably practicable, to achieve a better result for the companyâ€™s creditors
as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in
administration) - an example would be to allow the company to trade on in administration for long enough to complete a large order; or
â— if neither of the above is reasonably practicable and the administrator does not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors as a whole, realising the companyâ€™s property to
make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. Nevertheless, even if
there are insufficient funds to pay unsecured creditors the administrator must not unnecessarily harm their interests.
Schedule 1 gives an administrator full management powers which are not available to a
liquidator. The case of Re Consumer and Industrial Press Ltd[1988] BCLC 177, made under
previous legislation, gives an example of the second aspect of the single statutory purpose. The
company had since 1949 published a magazine. Net liabilities were judged by accountants
to be too great to trade out of trouble. The Inland Revenue petitioned for a compulsory
winding-up but the directors asked the court to make an administration order which the
court did. Administrators were appointed to manage the company so that at least one more
issue of the magazine could be published. The court thought that the company might be saved
by a voluntary arrangement which an administrator may propose but even if not it would get

Administration
a better price for the title if publication continued than if it were sold in a liquidation. This
would obviously be to the benefit of creditors.
Comment. The expression â€˜unnecessarily harmingâ€™ the interests of the creditors as a whole is
not defined and its practical effect is not clear. Presumably if the secured creditors wanted
an immediate sale of the secured assets (bearing in mind that in the developed future
they will not be able to appoint an administrative receiver) but the administrator takes the
view that the market is rising giving a better future realisation for the creditors as a whole,
would an immediate sale unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors as a whole? If the
administrator had insufficient funds to carry on the administration and so had to sell the
assets presumably he would be in the clear. We may see more applications to the court by
administrators seeking the courtâ€™s assistance. The court will, however, be reluctant it seems
to interfere with what is, in the end, a business decision (see T & D Industries plc[2000] 1 All
ER 333: comments made in that case).
Appointment of an administrator by the court
The Enterprise Act 2002 retains with some minor modifications the court route into administration. The court route can be used by the company (by ordinary resolution of the members or a unanimous written resolution), by the directors (by a majority decision at a board
meeting or by a unanimous written resolution) or by one or more creditors with no minimum value of debt. A holder of a floating charge must be able to satisfy the requirements of
a â€˜qualifying floating chargeâ€™. The most usual applicants for an administration order are the
companyâ€™s directors.
The qualifying floating charge
The requirements are set out in Enterprise Act 2002, Sch 16 which inserts Sch B1 to the IA
1986. Under para 14 of Sch B1:
(i) A qualifying floating charge (QFC) must be created by an instrument that:
â— states that para 14 applies to the floating charge;
â— purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator; or
â— purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver.
Note: even those pre-Enterprise Act 2002 floating charges that give power to appoint an
administrative receiver will thus give power to apply for an administration order.
(ii) A person will be regarded as holding a qualifying floating charge if he holds one or more
debentures of the company secured:
â— by a qualifying floating charge that relates to the whole or substantially the whole of
the companyâ€™s property;
â— by a number of QFCs that together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the
companyâ€™s property; or
â— by charges (including fixed charges) which together relate to the whole or substantially
the whole of the companyâ€™s property and at least one of which is a QFC.
What is required to satisfy the court in making the order?
The court must be satisfied that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts
and that the order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A qualifying
floating charge holder (QFCH) need only show that the charge is enforceable.

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
The process is initiated by filing a prescribed form of application with the court. There is
no requirement for what was known as a â€˜Rule 2.2 Reportâ€™ in support of the application. This
form of application replaces the former procedure by petition. The matter of the companyâ€™s
insolvency and whether the order, if made, reasonably achieves the purpose of the administration is expressed in a single-page statement from the proposed administrator. This replaces
the old Rule 2.2 Report. The application must be served on the holder of any QFC.
If others apply to the court for an order can a QFCH intervene?
A QFCH can intervene and appoint an administrative receiver (if entitled to do so) or administrator or make a request that a person specified by the QFCH be appointed administrator
in the application (see IA 1986, Sch B1, para 36). The court may accept or refuse the QFCHâ€™s
nominee as administrator (see IA 1986, Sch B1, para 36(2)). In practice the court is unlikely
to refuse, especially where the QFCH has chosen an insolvency practitioner from one of
the large accountancy firms. However, in this connection the High Court ruling in Re Colt
Telecom Ltd(20 December 2002, unreported), HC is of interest, though not based specifically
on the Enterprise Act 2002 provisions. In the case, Jacob J refused to make an administration
order because the company was not actually in default to the creditor who was applying to
the court. Nevertheless, he went on to say that even if he had had jurisdiction to make the
order he would not have done so because the accountant who had made the report to the
court in connection with the order was not impartial - he would stand to gain significantly in
fees if his report was accepted and he was appointed administrator.
Furthermore, there was a potential conflict of interest in that the firm involved had previously given the company tax advice. The judge also stated that the appointment of an administrator who lacked specialised knowledge of the telecoms industry which was possessed by
the companyâ€™s management would â€˜almost certainly stop the business in its tracksâ€™ and would
increase its running costs.
Comment. The judgeâ€™s comments may become highly relevant in regard to challenges to the
appointment of administrators under IA 1986, Sch B1, para 36.
Are there any special features in an application to the court by a QFCH?
A QFCH can make an application to the court for an administration order without having
to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts (IA 1986, Sch B1,
para 35). The court must, however, be satisfied that the floating charge is a QFC and has become
enforceable. The court may also make an administration order on the application of a QFCH,
even where the company is in compulsory liquidation so that the administration takes over.
It is also now open for any liquidator to make application to the court for the discharge of
the liquidation and the appointment of an administrator.
The fact that creditors object to the making of an administration order is not necessarily a
bar. In Structures and Computers Ltdv Ansys Inc(1997) The Times, 3 October the High Court
held that where it is satisfied that there is a real prospect of an administration order achieving
one or more of its purposes, the court has a jurisdiction to make the order under s 8 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 despite the fact that it is opposed by more than half of the companyâ€™s
unsecured creditors.
Notice of application for order
Notice of the application must be given to any person entitled to appoint a QFCH who may
intervene (see above).

Administration
Notification of appointment
An administrator must:
â— advertise the court order of his appointment in the London Gazette and in a newspaper
circulating in the area where the company has its principal place of business; and
â— send a copy of the court order to the Registrar of Companies within seven days with the
appropriate forms.
The Gazetteis published by the Stationery Office, and these notices are included in the Company
Law Official Notifications Supplementto the Gazettewhich is published on microfiche. Copies may
be seen at Companies House search rooms and some of the larger public libraries have copies.
Statements in support of an administration order: restriction orders
Under the Insolvency Rules 1986 Rule 2.2, a petition for an administration order was supported
by a report of an independent person to the effect that the appointment of an administrator
for the company is expedient. This report could be inspected by creditors and members of
the company concerned under Rule 7.31. The report might contain sensitive material and so
the court could, under Rule 7.31(5), make an order restricting inspection of the whole or part
of the report. The same problems may now apply to the shorter statement by the would-be
administrator. Application may be made by the Official Receiver or an insolvency practitioner
or any other person having an interest. Under a Practice Direction issued in April 2002 (see
[2002] 3 All ER 95) the High Court stated that good reason must be shown for a restriction
order otherwise it will not be made. The statement lists as appropriate grounds for a restriction
order: information about the perceived market for any assets of the company which it is anticipated could be sold in the administration or the period for which it is anticipated that trading
of the company would be continued by any administrator and the prospects for such trading.
The business application. This occurs where, for example, the directors of a company are
seeking an administration order and have a supporting statement. They may wish to ensure
that their legal and other advisers address the matter of a restriction order on matters that the
directors think are sensitive at what is after all a very early stagein the proceedings.
Appointment of an administrator out of court
Out of court appointments may be made by qualified floating charge holders and by the company or its directors. Ordinary creditors must seek an appointment through the court. The
requirements are as follows:
(a) Appointment by a QFCH
A QFCH must give two business daysâ€™ written notice to any prior QFCH. This notice is not
required if the relevant QFCH has consented to the making of the appointment.
This notice of intention to appoint may be filed in court but this is optional.
What must be filed in court following appointment? The QFCH must file in court:
(i) a notice of appointment;
(ii) a statutory declaration by the appointing QFCH that:
â— he is a QFCH;
â— the floating charge was enforceable when the appointment was made;
â— the appointment accords with the requirements of Insolvency Act 1986, Sch B1.

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
There must also be filed:
(iii) a statement by the administrator that:
â— he consents to the appointment;
â— the purpose of the administration is reasonably likely to be achieved.
When is the appointment effective? The appointment takes effect once the above filing
requirements have been satisfied. In the case of a QFCH, such as a bank, this filing requirement can be achieved out of court hours by fax.
Notification to the administrator. The fact that the court filing requirements set out above
have been complied with must be notified by the QFCH as soon as practicable after completion of filing.
Comment. A lender commits a criminal offence if, in the statutory declaration referred to
above, it makes a statement that it does not reasonably believe to be true (see IA 1986, Sch B1,
para 18(6)).
(b) Appointment by the company or the directors
Where the appointment is to be by the company or by its directors five business daysâ€™ notice
in writing of intention to appoint must be given to:
â— persons having the right to appoint an administrative receiver (where an exception applies);
â— persons having a right to appoint an administrator under Sch B1, para 14, i.e. a QFCH (IA
1986, Sch B1, para 26).
The notice of intention to appoint must be filed in court along with a statutory declaration by
the appointer that:
â— the company is likely to become unable to pay its debts;
â— the company is not in liquidation;
â— the appointment is not prevented because the company has been in administration instigated by the company or its directors, or subject to a moratorium in regard to a failed company voluntary arrange ment in the previous 12 months and that there are no outstanding
winding-up petitions in respect of the company and that there is not an administrator or
administrative receiver in office.
What else must be filed in court?
â— A notice of the appointment; and
â— a statutory declaration by the appointer that:
(a) the appointor is entitled to make the appointment;
(b) the appointment is in accordance with IA 1986, Sch B1;
(c) the statements in the statutory declaration filed with the notice of intention to appoint
are still accurate.
â— a statement by the administrator that:
(a) he consents to the appointment; and
(b) that the purpose of the administration is reasonably likely to be achieved. In this connection the administrator may rely on information supplied by the directors unless
there is reason to doubt its accuracy.
When is the appointment effective? The appointment of the administrator becomes effective when the above-mentioned filing requirements are completed satisfactorily.

Administration
Notification to the administrator. The fact that the court filing requirements set out above
have been satisfactorily completed must be notified to the administrator as soon as is practicable.
(i) Where directors or the company use the out of court route there is a requirement, as we
have seen, that notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given to a QFCH. Such
a holder then has a period of five business days to appoint its own administrator if it does
not consent to the companyâ€™s or the directorsâ€™ choice of administrator (IA 1986, Sch B1,
paras 14, 26). If the QFCH does not make its own appointment of an administrator the
company or the directors can carry on with making their own appointment of an administrator using the out of court route. Nevertheless, an interim moratorium on action by
creditors including action to enforce a security will commence when notice is given by
the company or the directors of their intention to appoint an administrator, i.e. earlier
than the actual appointment of the administrator (IA 1986, Sch B1, para 44). However,
the moratorium will not prevent the appointment of an administrative receiver where
one of the exceptions to the general prohibition on these appointments applies.
(ii) The company or the directors cannot make an out of court appointment if a winding-up
petition has been filed. A QFCH is not affected and may proceed with an appointment
with the petition being suspended (though not dismissed) if an administration is commenced out of court. By contrast, where the court makes an administration order, the
court is required to dismiss an outstanding winding-up petition.
Statement of affairs. Following appointment the administrator will request the companyâ€™s
officers and employees (where necessary) to supply a statement of affairs. This must be done
within 11 days of the request. It will be appreciated that the statement of affairs is the starting
point of the administration as indeed it is of any corporate insolvency procedure although
much of the information may be known in outline at least before the appointment of an
administrator. The statement gives particulars of the companyâ€™s assets and liabilities and
details of its creditors and although it is basically the responsibility of the companyâ€™s directors
it is often prepared by the companyâ€™s accountants.
Administratorâ€™s proposals
The following paragraphs of IA 1986, Sch B1 (as inserted by Enterprise Act 2002, Sch 16)
apply to the administrator, however appointed.
1 As soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any case within eight weeks of the company
going into administration (not three months as previously), the administrator must make
proposals as to how the purpose of the administration is to be achieved. The statement is
sent to the Registrar of Companies, the members of the company and all known creditors
(para 49).
2 The administrator must call an initial creditorsâ€™ meeting as soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any case within ten weeks of the company going into administration, to consider the proposals (para 51). The meeting need not be called if the administrator thinks
that there is insufficient property to make a distribution to unsecured creditors over and
above the ring-fenced asset distribution referred to below.
3 If there is a request by creditors whose debts amount to at least 10 per cent of the total debts
of the company, the administrator must convene a meeting even if the administrator considers that there will be no distribution to unsecured creditors (para 52).

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
4 Where the meeting is held, the creditors will vote on whether to accept the proposals or
whether to modify or reject them. A simple majority in value will decide.
5 The relevant times for sending proposals and convening the initial meeting of creditors
may be extended by court order or by the consent of all the secured creditors and more
than 50 per cent of the unsecured creditors (para 108(2)). It is an offence for an administrator to fail to comply with the above time periods.
6 Secured creditors vote in terms of the value of any shortfall between the debt and the
value of the security but the administratorâ€™s proposals cannot include action affecting the
right of the secured creditors to enforce the security, unless the secured creditor(s) consent
(para 73).
Comment. Since the fact of the administration prevents enforcement of the security without
the consent of the administrator or the court, this provision will mean that the administrator
will need the consent of the secured creditors before putting the proposals to the initial creditorsâ€™ meeting.
There is no need for secured creditor consent in regard to those proposals (if any) that relate
to a company voluntary arrangement under IA 1986 or a scheme of arrangement under the
Companies Acts 2006 Part 26 (ss.895-901) and Part 27 (special rules for public companies).
As reference to these procedures will show, there is secured-creditor protection built into
both of them.
Powers and duties of the administrator
The powers and duties contained in IA 1986, Sch 1 are retained, as is the power to act as the
companyâ€™s agent (para 69). In addition, an administrator is an officer of the court whether
appointed by the court or out of court(para 5).
An administrator may make distributions to secured creditors and preferential creditors
and, with the consent of the court, to unsecured creditors (paras 65, 66). This provides a contrast to previous legislation that did not give preference to Crown and employee claims in
an administration as was, and is, the case in an administrative receivership and a liquidation.
The Crown preference is abolished but employee claims and contributions to an occupational
pension scheme will have priority over the claims of a QFCH (para 65(2)).
An administrator retains the right to dispose of property subject to a floating charge as if
the charge did not exist. The expenses of the administration rank ahead of the claims of the
floating charge holder as regards the proceeds of sale. Other secured assets and property on
hire-purchase can be disposed of with the consent of the court (paras 70-72).
Administratorâ€™s expenses
These continue to rank in front of the claims of floating charge holders and also have priority
over preferential claims. This will relate mainly to employee claims and contributions to an
occupational pension fund.
The accountability of an administrator
The accountability of an administrator is as follows:
Creditors and members of the company in administration. These persons can make application to the court where the administrator acts or proposes to act in a way that could unfairly
harm their respective interests or where the applicant believes that the administrator is not
carrying out relevant functions as efficiently or as quickly as is reasonably practicable (para 74).

Administration
Any interested party. These persons can make application to the court where it is alleged
that the administrator has misapplied or retained the property of the company or is guilty
of misfeasance or in breach of fiduciary duty. So far this aspect of accountability is similar to
that under IA 1986, s 212 but now an application can be made while the company is still in
an administration instead of waiting until the company has gone into liquidation.
Cessation of an administration
The exit from administration may be achieved in the following ways:
â— Automatic cessation. The appointment of the administrator will come to an end automatically 12 months after the date on which the appointment took effect.
â— Extension of appointment. The period of 12 months can be extended once only by a period
of up to six months with the consent of the creditors or any number of times by the court on
the application of the administrator for such period as the court may determine. Creditor
consent means the consent of all the secured creditors and more than 50 per cent in value of
the unsecured creditors. Consent may be written or expressed by resolution at a meeting.
The above majorities disregard any creditor who does not respond to an invitation to give
or withhold consent. The above materials are contained in IA 1986, Sch B1, paras 76-78.
Administration: a timetable of major events
â— Seven days after appointment: notice of appointment filed at Companies House.
â— Eleven days after administratorâ€™s request: companyâ€™s officers and employees to provide
administrator with statement of affairs.
â— Eight weeks after appointment: administrator sends proposals to members, creditors and

Termination of administration through notice to
Registrar of Companies
If the company is not rescued, the exit routes from administration are streamlined by
provisions relating to voluntary liquidation and dissolution as follows:
(a) Where funds are available after payment of secured and preferential creditors. The company
can go directly into a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up. The administrator gives notice to
Companies House and the creditors, and files a copy with the court. There is no need
to hold a meeting of creditors and the administrator becomes the liquidator unless the
creditors put forward a different nomination. The intention is that these procedures will
reduce the number of compulsory liquidations that have followed administration.
(b) If no funds are available for distribution to creditors. The administrator must, unless the
court otherwise orders, give notice to that effect to Companies House. Copies must be
sent to creditors and the court. The company will be deemed dissolved after three months
from registration of the notice at Companies House, unless an interested person, e.g.
a member who believes the company has a good claim for damages against a third party,
makes application to the court.
The above provisions are to be found in IA 1986, Sch B1, paras 83-84.

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
Replacement of administrator
Where a QFCH has used the out of court route, and in the event that there was a prior ranking floating chargeholder entitled to make the appointment, then the prior charge holder can
apply to the court for the replacement of the administrator by his own nominee for the office
(IA 1986, Sch B1, para 96).
Abolition of Crown preference
Enterprise Act 2002, s 251 abolishes the preferential status of Crown debts. These are debts
due to the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and social security contributions. Employee
claims continue to be preferential, as do contributions to an occupational pension fund.
IA 1986, Sch 6 is amended accordingly.
Ring-fencing mechanism for unsecured creditors
In order to ensure that the benefit of the abolition of Crown preference does not go solely to
floating chargeholders the Enterprise Act 2002 sets up a mechanism for ring-fencing assets
where there is a floating charge that was created after the 2002 Act provisions came into force.
The abolition of Crown debts and the ring-fencing applies to all corporate insolvencies,
not merely to administration, though it is convenient to deal with it here. The ring-fence
arrangements do not apply where the fund is below a minimum to be prescribed and the
insolvency practitioner considers that the costs in distributing it would be disproportionate
to the benefits. The provision may also be disapplied by the terms of a company voluntary
arrangement or by a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the CA 2006 (note the changes
under ss 899(2) and 901). The court may also disapply it on the application of the insolvency
practitioner if he wishes to take this route.
Ring-fencing: the prescribed percentage
Under the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) Order 2003 the following thresholds apply:
â— minimum fund for distribution - Â£10,000;
â— prescribed percentage to be calculated on the basis of a sliding scale as follows: 50 per cent
of the first Â£10,000 of floating charge realisations; 20 per cent of floating charge realisations
after that;
â— up to a maximum ring-fenced fund of Â£600,000.
The ring-fencing provisions apply to relevant amounts of the companyâ€™s â€˜net propertyâ€™.
Net property is defined in Insolvency Act 1986, s 176A(5) (as inserted by Enterprise Act 2002)
as the amount of property which would, but for the ring-fencing provisions, be available for
the floating chargeholder. Thus, it represents any floating charge realisations.
Important business application
Lenders should check all existing documents to ensure that they cover the new out of court
route into administration rather than, for example, referring merely to administration orders
and petitions.
Administrator: legal consequences of appointment
Consideration has been given to the appointment of an administrator both in court and out
of court. The following materials deal with the main legal consequences of the appointment
together with case law on earlier provisions that carries through to illustrate the law.

Administration
Suspension of rights
From the presentation of a petition for an administration order and during the period of the
administration:
(i) no resolution to wind up the company may be passed nor may the court make a windingup order (IA 1986, Sch B1, para 40);
(ii) there can be no enforcement of fixed charges or other security over the companyâ€™s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court (IA 1986, Sch B1,
(iii) there can be no recovery of property which the company has under a hire-purchase
agreement or leasing arrangement and retention clauses are not enforceable except with
the consent of the administrator or the court (IA 1986, Sch B1, para 43);
(iv) no other legal proceedings can be commenced against the company except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court (IA 1986, Sch B1, para 43).
The Court of Appeal has ruled that the administratorâ€™s consent or leave of the court is necessary
to commence or continue criminal as well as civil proceedings against a company in administration (see Re Rhondda Waste Disposal Ltd (in administration) [2000] EGCS 25). In this
case the Environmental Agency wished to prosecute for failure to comply with one of the conditions of a waste management licence. The court gave leave because the pollution was serious.
Consent or leave is also required even if a civil action is not being brought by a creditor
but by a claimant suing for alleged breach of a patent (see Biosource Technologies Incv Axis
Genetics plc (in Administration)[2000] 1 BCLC 286).
In regard to (iii) above the High Court ruled in Razzaq v Pala [1997] 1 WLR 1336 and
Re Lomax Leisure Ltd[1999] 1 All ER 22 that a landlordâ€™s right to forfeit a lease is not in the
nature of a security over a companyâ€™s property in a legal sense. Therefore the moratorium
preventing anyone from taking steps to enforce a security over the property of a company
while in administration does not bind a landlord. The cases had considerable significance for
creditors who initiate an administration, particularly the larger scale administrations where
there may be a number of leaseholds among the assets of the company. They have no way of
knowing whether the ob jects of the administration will be achieved since the landlords will
be able to frustrate the purpose of the administration by forfeiting leases or by requiring
payment of rents for not doing so. Thus placing themselves in a superior position to other
creditors since they can achieve payment of arrears of rent or forfeit the lease and market
it elsewhere even during the course of the administration.
Landlordâ€™s right of forfeiture
IA 1986, Sch B1, para 43(4) prohibits a landlordâ€™s right to re-entry by forfeiture of the lease
except by leave of the court. Once an administration order has been made or is in force,
re-entry by forfeiture continues to be barred except by permission of the administrator or
leave of the court.
No inhibition of rescue schemes
In order to prevent the administratorâ€™s schemes to save the company or to conduct the company as near as possible as a going concern until liquidation as in Re Consumer and Industrial
Press Ltd (1988), it is sometimes necessary to deal with persons who have charges or other
rights over the property of the company and whose consent is required before the property is
sold. A rescue package may very well involve such sales.

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
In this connection IA 1986, Sch B1, paras 70 and 71 provide as follows:
(a) Assets subject to a floating charge can be sold by the administrator and the proceeds used
in the business. The permission of the chargeholder is not required nor is it necessary for
the administrator to obtain the permission of the court. However, the chargeholder has
the same priority as he had before over the assets generally as they may be from time to
time and this would include the proceeds of sale and other assets which might be purchased with the proceeds because these would be included in the general assets of the
company (para 70).
(b) Assets held on hire-purchase or subject to a fixed charge can be sold but court approval
must be obtained and the proceeds mustbe used to pay off the chargeholder or owner.
In addition, and so as to ensure that the administrator gets the market price, IA 1986,
Sch B1, para 71 provides that the administrator must make up any difference between the
sale price and the market price.
The companyâ€™s contracts
Following the refusal of administrators to complete a contract entered into by the company
before their appointment, the High Court was asked to consider in that context its powers of
intervention (see C E King Ltd (in Administration)[2000] 2 BCLC 297).
The judge decided that in general terms it would be inappropriate to make an order requiring the administrators to perform the relevant contract. Administrators were appointed (and
expected) to make commercial decisions and where necessary take legal advice. In the end,
however, the matter of performing (or not) the companyâ€™s contracts remains a commercial
decision to be taken by the administrators.
Directors and employees
The directors are not dismissed by the appointment of an administrator. However, their
powers are suspended and the administrator may remove any director of the company and
appoint any person to be a director of it whether to fill a vacancy or as an additional director.
The appointment of an administrator does not operate to dismiss the companyâ€™s employees.
The reason for this is that under IA 1986, Sch B1, para 69 he is said to act as an agent of the
company and so there is no change in the personality of the employer. However, an administrator can terminate contracts of employment.
Employeesâ€™ contracts and the provisions of
the Enterprise Act 2002
The provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 which were relevant stated, in s 19, that nothing
done or omitted to be done within 14 days of appointment (of an administrator and by
the administrator) shall be construed as â€˜adoptionâ€™ (of employment contracts by the administrator). The position where contracts of employment are adopted by an administrator is that
sums outstanding called â€˜qualifying liabilitiesâ€™, i.e. wages or salaries including sickness and
holiday pay and contributions to occupational pension funds incurred after the adoption
of an employment contract, are payable in priority to the claims of preferential creditors
and holders of floating charges and if, at the end of the administration, there are qualifying
liabilities unpaid and there are insufficient funds to pay them and the administratorâ€™s remuneration and expenses, the outstanding amount is payable in full before the administratorâ€™s
remuneration and expenses (see below).

Administration
A problem for administrators has been whether failure to act during the first 14 days can
be regarded as â€˜adoptionâ€™ of employment contracts leading to the above mentioned loss of
remuneration and expenses. The matter was raised in the High Court under the old law (see
Antal International Ltd[2003] EWHC 1339 (Ch), [2003] 2 BCLC 406).
In this case the administrators asked the court for directions on the matter of the alleged
adoption of the contracts of a group of French workers. The company, its auditors and the
administrators had originally thought the 12 workers were employed by a subsidiary company but it emerged that they were in fact employees of Antal. This was discovered 16 days
after the administratorsâ€™ appointment. Had the contracts been adopted by inactivity in the
last two days? The High Court ruled that they had not. Adoption would only occur when
the administrators had done something that amounted to choosing to adopt. The mere
keeping on of employees did not amount to adoption. Once the administrators became aware
of the French employees they took immediate steps to terminate their contracts under
French law.
Antaland Enterprise Act 2002 changes
The Enterprise Act 2002 inserts new provisions in the 1986 Act as Sch B1. Paragraph 99 of that
Schedule applicable to administrations on or after 15 September 2003 states that â€˜action taken
within the period of 14 days after an administratorâ€™s appointment shall not be taken to
amount or contribute to the adoption of a [contract of employment]â€™. This seems to cut out
all failure to act and is in line with the decision of the House of Lords in Powdrillv Watson
[1995] 2 AC 394 (see below).
The decision in Powdrillv Watson
In Powdrillv Watson[1995] 2 AC 394 the House of Lords ruled that inaction by the administrators after the 14-day period could not amount to â€˜adoptionâ€™ of employment contracts.
However, their Lordships did also rule that administrators could not actively retain employees after the 14-day period and avoid liability by sending each employee a letter disclaiming
adoption. Such a letter was of no effect. That this was the case was also held by the Court of
Appeal and that merely allowing employment to continue after 14 days could amount to
adoption. This latter ruling, however, was not acceptable to the House of Lords which ruled
that some conduct amounting to an election to adopt an employment contract was required.
The position in case law and under insolvency legislation would appear now to be the
Pension funds
The High Court has decided that the duty of an administrator to manage the â€˜companyâ€™s
affairsâ€™ - as referred to in Insolvency Act 1986, Sch B1, paras 59 and 68 - includes the trusteeship of any employeesâ€™ pension funds where the company had previously been the trustee.
Furthermore, the administrator could only be reimbursed those costs out of the pension fund
to which the company would have been entitled but could make a claim for any costs or
expenses incurred in actually running the scheme as costs of the administration generally
and not as a specific charge against the trust fund (see Polly Peck International plc (in
Administration)v Henry[1999] 1 BCLC 407). Mr Justice Buckley so ruled when dismissing
an application by the administrators of Polly Peck International (PPI) for a new trustee,
i.e. the Trustee Corporation Ltd to be appointed as trustee of the two pension funds set up

Chapter 25 Corporate insolvency - company rescue
IA 1986, Sch B1, para 68 provides that, where an appointment is made in court, the administration order is an order directing that during the period for which the order is in force, the
affairs, business and property of the company shall be managed by a person (the administrator) appointed for the purpose by the court. IA 1986, Sch B1, para 59(c) provides that the
administrator of the company may do all such things as may be necessary for the management
of the affairs, business and property of the company.

The capital structure of the subsidiaries consists of ordinary shares, several classes of preference

of the capital structure of the subsidiaries, the board of directors of Plym plc wish to introduce
a simplified system whereby Plym would purchase the minority shares and debentures for cash
or in the alternative issue fully paid equity shares in Plym in exchange for the said shares and
debentures at an agreed ratio. Preliminary inquiries indicate that there is a substantial minority

4 Discredit Bank plc is a large merchant bank situated in the City of London. The Chairman and
Managing Director of the company is Dan, a high-powered executive who is well-respected in
the City. Seven other directors sit on the board, including Maggie, the Finance Director. Dan
and Maggie, together with some of the other directors, have a shareholding but they do not
represent the majority.
Last year, Dan purchased property on Discreditâ€™s behalf from Chivers-Benson plc of whom
Dan is a director. The property, which was valued by Chivers-Benson, was bought by Discredit
for Â£400,000. Within two weeks of Discredit buying the property, it was sold to Briac Ltd, a subsidiary company of Chivers-Benson, for Â£100,000.
Last month Dan was approached by Homestore plc for the financing of new shop development in London. Dan informed Homestore that Discredit was not in a position to provide
Homestore with financial backing but that he, himself, could provide the finance through the
setting-up of a separate company. He persuades Maggie to assist him in the incorporation of
Quick Loan Ltd, which, owing to Danâ€™s influence in the City enabling the finance to be provided
to Homestore, makes a profit of Â£70,000 on the deal. Both Danâ€™s and Maggieâ€™s shares in Quick
Loan have increased in value.

Corporate insolvency - procedures
other than rescue

Chapter 26 Corporate insolvency - procedures other than rescue
In this chapter we take an overview of corporate insolvency procedures that are not in their
major aims concerned to rescue a company from an insolvency situation.
Receiverships
Administrative receivers: the demise of
An administrative receiver was the usual appointment of a bank when a company with an
overdraft and/or a loan was in financial difficulties. The bank invariably held a floating charge
on the companyâ€™s undertaking and the function of this type of receiver was to undertake such
procedures with the company as would pay off the bank. These receivers were not primarily
concerned with company rescue as an administrator is. What is more the existence of the
office of administrative receiver inhibited the rescue procedures of an administration because
if the company or its creditors tried to make an appointment of an administrator the bank,
which had to be notified, would often immediately appoint an administrative receiver and
this would in law veto the administration.
The Enterprise Act 2002 inserted provisions into the Insolvency Act 1986 that prevent the
holder of a floating charge such as a bank from appointing an administrative receiver except
in a restricted number of organisations such as some companies involved in financial market
operations. These are beyond the scope of this text and are unlikely to be raised in examinations in corporate law at a non-specialist level.
However, it should be recognised that the ban on the appointment of administrative
receivers will not be complete for some time since the relevant provisions of the Enterprise
Act 2002 did not come into force until September 2003 and banks that had taken floating
charges over continuing overdrafts before that date are still able to appoint such practitioners.
However, it is most unlikely that an examiner would see the need or the sense in asking
questions on the detail of the law relating to administrative receivers. The office is from the
student point of view redundant and no more will be said about it in this text.
The practice of appointing receivers without management powers by those who have taken
fixed charges over corporate property will continue. These practitioners are in no sense managers appointed to deal with the borrowing companyâ€™s business and pay off the debt. They are
appointed merely to sell the charged property to pay the debt or, for example, to collect
income such as rent from the companyâ€™s tenants (if any) until the debt is paid. They do not
have to be authorised insolvency practitioners and the practice is to appoint chartered
surveyors to do this work.
Winding-up or striking off
A companyâ€™s life can be brought to an end by a process known as winding-up. This process is
carried through by a liquidatorwhose functions are:

Voluntary winding-up
(a) to settle the list of contributories;
(b) to collect the companyâ€™s assets;
(c) to discharge the companyâ€™s liabilities to its creditors;
(d) to redistribute the surplus (if any) to the contributories according to the rights attaching
to their shares of the companyâ€™s capital.
There are two methods of winding-up:
(i) a compulsory winding-up by the court;
(ii) a voluntary winding-up, which may be either a membersâ€™ winding-up or a creditorsâ€™
winding-up.
We shall now proceed to examine the general characteristics of these various types.
Compulsory winding-up
A company may be wound up by the court when a number of situations occur - the most
common being when the company is unable to pay its debts.
A petition for winding-up may be presented by the company or by the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), but is normally presented by a creditor.
When there is a petition for winding-up, the court is not forced to make an order, but if it
does, a liquidator is appointed who realises the assets and pays the creditors, handing over
the surplus (if any) to the shareholders. When the companyâ€™s affairs are fully wound up, the
court will make an order dissolving the company. The order is registered with the Registrar
of Companies by the liquidator, and the Registrar makes an entry on the Register dissolving
the company from the date of the court order.
Voluntary wind ing-up
A company may apply to the Registrar of Companies to be struck off the register and dissolved. The company can do this if it is no longer needed. For example, the directors may wish
to retire and there is no one to take over from them; or it is a subsidiary whose name is no
longer needed; or it was set up to exploit an idea that turned out not to be feasible. This may
not happen however if the Registrar of Companies has already started dissolution action
under s 1000 (power to strike off company not carrying on business or in operation). This
procedure is not an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings where these are appropriate.
Even if the company is struck off and dissolved, creditors and others could apply for the
company to be restored to the register.
Sections 1004 and 1005 of the Companies Act 2006 set out the circumstances in which
the company may not apply to be struck off. For example, the company may not make an
application for voluntary strike off if, at any time in the last three months, it has traded or
otherwise carried on business, changed its name, made a disposal for value of property or
rights that, immediately before ceasing to trade or otherwise carry on business, it held for the
purpose of disposal for gain in the normal course of trading or otherwise carrying on business.

Chapter 26 Corporate insolvency - procedures other than rescue
A company cannot apply to be struck off if it is the subject, or proposed subject, of any insolvency proceedings (such as liquidation, including where a petition has been presented but has
not yet been dealt with); or a s 895 scheme (that is a compromise or arrangement between a
company and its creditors or members). However, a company can apply for strike off if it has
settled trading or business debts in the previous three months.
A company may be wound up voluntarily:
(a) When the period, if any, fixed for the duration of the company by the articles expires,
or the event, if any, occurs, on the occurrence of which the articles provide that the company is to be dissolved, and the company in general meeting has passed an ordinary resolution requiring the company to be wound up voluntarily. A limitation on a companyâ€™s
duration is in practice very rare.
(b) If the company resolves by special resolution that the company be wound up voluntarily
for any cause whatever.
(c) If the company resolves by extraordinary resolution to the effect that it cannot by reason
of its liabilities continue its business, and that it is advisable to wind up.
When a company has passed a resolution for voluntary winding-up, it must give notice
of the resolution by an advertisement in the London Gazette within 14 days. The voluntary
winding-up is deemed to commence at the time of the passing of the resolution.
Withdrawal of application
If the directors wish to withdraw an application, they must withdraw it by sending the
â€˜Withdrawal of striking off application by a companyâ€™, Form DS02 if they change their mind
or the company ceases to be eligible for striking off. This may be because, after applying to be
struck off, the company trades or otherwise carries on business, changes its name, for value,
disposes of any property or rights except those it needed in order to make or proceed with
the application:
â— becomes subject to formal insolvency proceedings or makes a s 900 application (a compromise or arrangemen t between a company and its creditors);
â— engages in any other activity, unless it was necessary to make or proceed with a striking off
application, conclude those of its affairs that are outstanding because of the need to make
or proceed with an application (such as paying the costs of running office premises while
concluding its affairs and then finally disposing of the office);
â— and comply with a statutory requirement.
Any director of the company may complete and sign the â€˜Withdrawal of striking off application by a companyâ€™, Form DS02, and send it to the Registrar. Section 1009 of the 2006 Act
contains the full circumstances that mean you must withdraw an application for strike off and
question 12 contains information on the offences for failure to withdraw an application.
Objections
Objections or complaints to a voluntary winding up application must be in writing and sent
to the Registrar with any supporting evidence, such as copies of invoices that may prove the
company is trading.
Some of the reasons could include:

Voluntary winding-up
â— if the company has broken any of the conditions of its application for example, it has
traded, changed its name or become subject to insolvency proceedings during the threemonth period before the application, or afterwards;
â— if the directors have not informed interested parties;
â— if any of the declarations on the form are false;
â— if some form of action is being taken, or is pending, to recover any money owed (such as
a winding-up petition or action in a small claims court);
â— if other legal action is being taken against the company;
â— if the directors have wrongfully traded or committed a tax fraud or some other offence (see
ss 1004 and 1005 of the 2006 Act).
It is an offence:
â— to apply when the company is ineligible for striking off;
â— to provide false or misleading information in, or in support of, an application;
â— not to copy the application to all relevant parties within seven days;
â— not to withdraw application if the company becomes ineligible.
The offences attract a fine of up to a maximum of Â£5,000 on summary conviction (before
a magistratesâ€™ court or Sheriff Court) or an unlimited fine on indictment (before a jury).
If the directors breach the requirements to give a copy of the application to relevant parties
and do so with the intention of concealing the application, they are also potentially liable to
not only a fine but also up to seven yearsâ€™ imprisonment. Anyone convicted of these offences
may also be disqualified from being a director for up to 15 years.
Declaration of solvency
Where it is proposed to wind up a company voluntarily, the directors, or a majority of them
if there are more than two, may at a meeting of the board make a statutory declaration that
they have made a full enquiry into the affairs of the company and have formed the opinion
that it will be able to pay its debts in full within a stated period of not more than 12 months
from the beginning of the winding-up. To be effective, such declaration must be made within
the five weeks before the passing of the winding-up resolution or on that date but before the
resolution was passed, and must be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration,
and must embody a statement of the companyâ€™s assets and liabilities as at the latest practicable date before the making of the declaration, though errors and omissions will not necessarily render the statement invalid. Thus, in De Courcy v Clements[1971] 1 All ER 681, the
statement of the companyâ€™s assets and liabilities was held to be valid even though it omitted
to state that a debt of Â£45,000 was owed by the company to a third party. Megarry J observed
that what is now the Insolvency Act 1986 did not require absolute perfection since, among
other things, a liquidator who forms the opinion that the company will not be able to pay its
debts in full within the period specified in the declaration of solvency must forthwith summon a creditorsâ€™ meeting and put the matter to them. The creditors can petition for a compulsory winding-up, notwithstanding the voluntary liquidation, and might therefore be
regarded as adequately protected. Directors making such a declaration without reasonable
grounds are liable to heavy penalties.

Chapter 26 Corporate insolvency - procedures other than rescue
The advantage to the company of such a declaration is that the winding-up is then a
â€˜membersâ€™ voluntary winding-upâ€™. In the absence of such a declaration, it must be a â€˜creditorsâ€™
voluntary winding-upâ€™.
Commonly HMRC (which is no longer a preferential creditor) has not completed its tax
assessments on the company and has not therefore been paid. Nevertheless, if funds are available to pay HMRC when liability (which has been approximated) is ascertained, a membersâ€™
voluntary winding-up may continue and there is no need to convert to a creditorsâ€™ voluntary,
nor are the directors liable for a false declaration that the companyâ€™s debts will be paid during the stated period of not longer than 12 months.
Membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up
The company in general meeting, and by ordinary resolution, must appoint one or more
liquidators for the purpose of winding up the company and distributing its assets, and may
fix the remuneration to be paid to him or them. The appointment may be made at the same
meeting at which the resolution for winding-up was passed.
On the appointment of the liquidator all the powers of the directors cease, except in so far as
their continuance is sanctioned either by the company in general meeting or by the liquidator.
However, a resolution for voluntary winding-up does not automatically dismiss all employees
but if the liquidator does not carry on the business, which he may do for beneficial winding-up,
e.g. to complete work in progress so that the finished articles may be sold more profitably, then
employees are dismissed (Reigate v Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom)[1918] 1 KB 592).
If a liquidator dies, resigns, or otherwise vacates his office, the company may in general
meeting and subject to any arrangement with its creditors, fill the vacancy. Such a meeting
may be convened by any contributory or, if there were more liquidators than one, by those
continuing. However, as a general rule a single shareholder cannot constitute a meeting for
the purpose of making a valid appointment of a liquidator (In Re London Flats Ltd, 1969, see
âž¨ See p. 412 Chapter 20 âž¨), except in the case of the single-member company.
If the liquidator at any time forms the opinion that the company will be unable to pay its
debts in full within the period stated in the statutory declaration, he must forthwith summon
a meeting of creditors. When the liquidator calls the meeting of creditors the company is
deemed to be in a creditorsâ€™ voluntary scheme, and that meeting may exercise the same powers
as a creditorsâ€™ meeting at the beginning of a liquidation which is initiated as a creditorsâ€™
winding-up, including appointing their nominee as liquidator and a liquidation committee.
In any event, if the winding-up continues for more than a year, the liquidator must summon a general meeting of the company at the end of the first year and of each succeeding year,
or at the first convenient date within three months from the end of the year, or such longer
period as the BIS may allow. He must lay before the meeting an account of his acts and dealings, and the conduct of the winding-up during the preceding year.
As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound up, the liquidator must make up an
account of the winding-up showing how it has been conducted, and how the property of the
company has been disposed of, and then call a general meeting of the company in order to lay
the account before it and explain it. The meeting is called by advertisement in the London

Creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up
Gazette, specifying the time, place and object of the meeting. The advertisement must be published at least one month before the meeting.
Within one week after the meeting the liquidator must send to the Registrar of Companies
a copy of the account, and make a return to him of the holding of the meeting and its date.
If no quorum was present at the meeting, the liquidator makes a return to the effect that the
meeting was duly summoned and no quorum was present, and this is deemed to constitute
compliance. The Registrar must publish in the London Gazette notice of the receipt by him of
the return of the holding of the meeting.
The Registrar then registers the account and return as to the meeting and three months
after such registration the company is deemed to be dissolved. The liquidator or any interested person may apply to the court for the deferment of dissolution and, if the grounds seem
adequate, the court may defer the date as it thinks fit. The court may, after the dissolution,
make an order declaring the dissolution void, again on the application of the liquidator or any
interested person being someone who has a claim against its assets, e.g. a creditor.
In the case of creditors, and others generally, the court cannot order restoration to the
Register after two years, but in the case of those wishing to make claims for personal injury
against the company, the time can be extended for a longer period up to the maximum time
allowed for bringing the claim under the Limitation Act 1980. For example, where the injury
was not apparent at the time of an accident the time is three years after the injury did become
apparent. Thus, if there is an injury to the head which later is seen to have caused blindness,
the time would be three years after discovering the blindness; so a company responsible for
the initial injury could be restored to the Register, so that a claim could be made against
it some years after it had been dissolved. These restoration provisions apply regardless of
the method of winding-up. This will enable a person to get a judgment and make a claim on
the company, the claim then being, in effect, met by the companyâ€™s insurers. It is, however,
necessary to make the claim against the company before the insurance indemnity is triggered
and the above provisions enable this to be done.
Where the liquidator has been obliged to call a meeting of creditors because of insolvency,
these procedures are modified and those appropriate to a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up apply.
Creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up
Where a company proposes to wind up voluntarily and the directors are not in a position to
make the statutory declaration of solvency, the company must call a meeting of its creditors
not later than the fourteenth day after the membersâ€™ meeting at which the resolution for
voluntary winding-up is to be proposed. Notices of this meeting are to be sent by post to
creditors not less than seven days before the day of the creditorsâ€™ meeting.
The company must advertise a notice of the creditorsâ€™ meeting once in the London Gazette
and once at least in two local newspapers circulating in the district where it has its registered
office or principal place of business.
The directors must place before the creditorsâ€™ meeting a full statement of the companyâ€™s
affairs, together with a list of creditors and the estimated amount of their claims, and appoint
a director to preside at the meeting. The notice of the meeting must give the name and address
of an insolvency practitioner who will give creditors information about the company or state
a place where a list of creditors can be inspected.

Chapter 26 Corporate insolvency - procedures other than rescue
Appointment of liquidator
The creditors and the company at their respective meetings may nominate a liquidator. If the
creditors do not nominate one, the companyâ€™s nominee becomes the liquidator. If the creditors and the company nominate different persons, the person nominated by the creditors
has preference. However, where different persons are nominated, any director, member or
creditor of the company may, within seven days after the date on which the nomination was
made by the creditors, apply to the court for an order to appoint the companyâ€™s nominee to
act either instead of or in conjunction with the creditorsâ€™ nominee, or alternatively to appoint
some other person.
At the same meeting the creditors may, if they think fit, appoint a liquidation committee
âž¨ See p. 578 to act with the liquidator (see Chapter 26 âž¨). On the appointment of a liquidator all the
powers of the directors cease, except in so far as the liquidation committee, or, if there is no
such committee, the creditors sanction their continuance. The position of employees is the
same as in a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up.
If a vacancy occurs, by death, resignation or otherwise, in the office of liquidator, other than
a liquidator appointed by or by the direction of the court, the creditors may fill the vacancy.
Where the winding-up continues for more than a year, the liquidator must summon a general meeting of the company and a meeting of the creditors at the end of the first and each
succeeding year, or within three months of that time, and lay before the meetings an account
of the conduct of the winding-up during the preceding year. The BIS may allow modifications
to the time limit.
Centrebinding
In the past, when no particular qualifications were required to undertake insolvency work, it
was possible for the members in a creditorsâ€™ voluntary to appoint a liquidator from among a
group of unscrupulous persons prepared to participate in fraud. The person appointed would
then proceed to dispose of the company assets and dissipate the proceeds often into other
enterprises of the directors or their associates. This was done without the holding of a creditorsâ€™ meeting to affirm the appointment of the liquidator, and by the time the creditors
became aware of the liquidation it was too late to do anything about it. The difficulty was that
the disposal of the assets by the membersâ€™ liquidator was quite legal. The court so decided in
Re Centrebind [1966] 3 All ER 889 and the procedure became known as â€˜centrebindingâ€™.
The practice has been brought to an end for two reasons as follows:
(a) the requirement of qualified insolvency practitioners; and
(b) because of s 166, which provides that until a meeting of creditors has been called to
approve the companyâ€™s liquidator, that liquidator has power only to take control of the
companyâ€™s property and to sell perishable goods. Any other dispositions of the companyâ€™s property are invalid.
Final meetings and dissolution
As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound up, the liquidator makes an account of
the winding-up, and calls a general meeting of the company and a meeting of the creditors to
lay before them the account and give an explanation of it. This meeting must be advertised in
the London Gazette, specifying the time and place and object, the advertisement being published one month at least before the meeting.

Alternatives to winding-up
Within one week after the date of the meeting or, if they are not held on the same date,
after the date of the later meeting, the liquidator must send to the Registrar a copy of the
account and a return of the holding of the meetings and their dates. If a quorum is not present at either meeting, the return should specify that the meeting was duly summoned and
that no quorum was present and this will suffice. As with a membersâ€™ voluntary liquidation,
the Registrar registers the returns and the company is dissolved at the end of three months,
subject to the rights of the liquidator or of interested persons to apply for the date to be
deferred. The Registrar must cause to be published in the London Gazette notice of the receipt
by him of the return of the holding of the meeting.
Applications to court
The liquidator or any contributory or creditor may apply to the court to determine any question arising in the winding-up of a company, or to exercise, as respects the enforcing of calls
or any other matter, all or any of the powers which the court might exercise if the company
were being wound up by the court, and the court may accede to these requests and make such
orders as it thinks just. A copy of any such order must be sent forthwith by the company, or
otherwise as may be prescribed, to the Registrar of Companies for minuting in his books
relating to the company.
Rights of creditors and contributories
Notwithstanding the fact that the company is being wound up voluntarily, a creditor or contributory may still apply to have it wound up by the court, but the court must be satisfied that,
in the case of a contributory, the rights of the contributories will be prejudiced by a voluntary
winding-up.
Alternatives to winding-up
There are two ways in which a company can be dissolved without following winding-up
procedures.
Striking off at the instigation of the Registrar: defunct companies
The dissolution here results where the Registrar has a reasonable cause to believe that a company is not carrying on business or is not in operation. This jurisdiction, which has been with
us for many years, is currently to be found in s 1000 of the 2006 Act. The Registrar may act
because, for example:
(a) he has not received documents from the company which should have been sent to him; or
(b) correspondence sent to the companyâ€™s registered office by the Registrar has been returned
undelivered.
The Registrar will enquire if the company is still in business or operation. If he is satisfied
that it is not, he will publish a notice in the London Gazette of his intention to strike the company off the register. The Company Law Official Notifications Supplement to the London

Chapter 26 Corporate insolvency - procedures other than rescue
Gazette publishes weekly notices in microfiche form. A copy notice is placed on the companyâ€™s public record.
The Registrar will take into account representations from the company and other interested parties, such as members and creditors, but unless cause to the contrary is shown,
the Registrar will strike the company off not less than three months after the date of the
notice. The company is, in fact, dissolved on publication of a further notice to that effect in
the London Gazette. It will be seen, therefore, that if the company is to remain in business,
it is important for the company to reply promptly to any formal letter of inquiry from the
Registrar and to deliver any outstanding documents. Failure to deliver the documents
required may result in the directors being prosecuted.
Assets of dissolved company
From the date of dissolution any assets held by a dissolved company will be bona vacantia
(property without an owner). This means that they belong to the Crown. The main source of
enquiry in regard to bona vacantiaproperty is the Treasury Solicitor (BV), One Kemble Street,
London WC2B 4TS. See http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk. If the companyâ€™s registered office
is in Lancashire, enquiries should be addressed to the Solicitor to the Duchy of Lancaster,
66 Lincolnâ€™s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LH. Where the registered office is in Cornwall or the
Isles of Scilly, enquiries should be made to the Solicitor to the Duchy of Cornwall, 10
Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6LA.
Applications for striking off
A private company which is not trading but which is sending relevant documents and returns
to the Registrar may apply to the Registrar to be struck off the register. The procedure is useful, for example, for companies formed to pursue what was thought to be a good project but
which has failed. Nevertheless, the directors may be in a position to deal with its assets and
liabilities and ensure that the companyâ€™s affairs are brought to a conclusion without the cost of
employing an insolvency practitioner as liquidator. Until the company is struck off the register, though, the directors a re burdened with duties under the Companies Acts, such as filing
accounts and annual returns. Accordingly, the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994,
s 13 and Sch 5 introduce new ss 652A-652F into the Companies Act 1985 to provide for the
application procedure. These sections are now contained in ss 1000-1011 of the Companies
Application is made by the directors or a majority of them under s 1003 of the CA 2006.
The application is returned to the Registrar and copies must be sent to notifiable parties
(see below). In general terms, the company should have concluded its affairs, though even
after making application it can conclude its outstanding affairs where necessary or expedient
to make or proceed with an application, e.g. paying the costs of running office premises while
concluding its affairs and disposing of the office.
It is important to note that in the previous three months the company must not have:
â— changed its name;
â— traded or carried on its business;
â— made a disposal for value of property that it held immediately prior to ceasing to trade, for
the purpose of disposal for gain in the normal course of business or otherwise carrying on
business; or

Alternatives to winding-up
â— engaged in any other activity except for the purposes of making the application, concluding the affairs of the company complying with any statutory requirement or as specified by
the Secretary of State by order for the purpose of s 1004(1); furthermore
â— any property which has not been transferred out of the company will be regarded as bona
vacantia (goods without an owner) and will become the property of the Crown. There
should therefore be no assets or liabilities at the time of dissolution. The potential liability
of the directors to members and creditors remains.
A company cannot apply to be struck off if it is the subject, or proposed subject of:
â— any insolvency proceedings such as liquidation and including a situation where a petition
has been presented but has not yet been dealt with; or
â— a scheme under Part 26 of the 2006 Act (section 895), i.e. a compromise or arrangement
between the company and its creditors or members.
However, a company can apply for strike off if it has settled trading or business debts in the
previous three months. Further circumstances in which an application cannot be made can
be found in ss 1004 and 1005 of the Companies Act 2006.
When the company meets all of the above criteria for striking off, an application (DS01)
can be completed, signed by the majority of directors and submitted with a Â£10 fee to
Companies House. The form must be signed and dated by:
â— the sole director, if there is only one;
â— by both, if there are two; or
â— by all, or the majority of directors, if there are more than 2.
Notifiable persons
A copy of the application must be sent within seven days of making the application to:
â— members, usually the shareholders;
â— creditors, including all contingent (existing) and prospective (likely) creditors such as
banks, suppliers, former employees if the company owes them money, landlords, tenants
(for example, where a bond is refundable), guarantors and personal injury claimants;.
â— employees;
â— managers or trustees of an employeesâ€™ pension fund; and
â— any directors who have not signed the form (see s 1006(1)).
These notifiable persons can object to the court against the striking off for up to 20 years
after the publication by the Registrar of the striking off in the London Gazette. Such an objection might be raised because a notifiable person was owed money by the company and is
taking action in court to recover it or because the conditions for application for striking off
have been breached.
In addition to persons notifiable under s 1006, other interested parties should be informed
such as the local authority where there have been planning disputes and health and safety
issues. HMRC should be informed in advance of an application to strike off. HMRC is the
main objector in the striking-off process and can hold up the procedure for some time. It is
better therefore to clear matters with HMRC and other interested parties before making the
application. Consideration must also be given to notifying the Department of Work and
Pensions if there are outstanding, contingent or prospective liabilities that would be of concern to this agency.

Chapter 26 Corporate insolvency - procedures other than rescue
Safeguards exist for those who are likely to be affected by a companyâ€™s dissolution. Loose
ends, such as closing the companyâ€™s bank account, the transfer of any domain names should
all be taken care of before applying for voluntary wind up. In addition to notifying HMRC,
a company may want to notify local authorities, especially if the company is under any obligation involving planning permission or health and safety issues, training and enterprise
councils and government agencies.
Finally it should be noted that from the date of dissolution, any assets of a dissolved company will belong to the Crown. The companyâ€™s bank account will be frozen and any credit
balance in the account will pass to the Crown.
The companyâ€™s directors must also send a copy of the application to any person who,
after the application has been made, becomes a director, member, creditor or employee of the
company, or a manager or trustee of any employee pension fund of the company. This must
be done within seven days of the person becoming one of these. They must also send a copy
of the application to any person who becomes one of the above at any time after the day the
company made the application for voluntary strike off. This obligation continues until the
dissolution of the company or the withdrawal of the application.
A copy of the â€˜Striking off application by a companyâ€™ Form DS01 can be left at the last
known address (if an individual) or the principal/registered office (if a company or other
body). It is also permissible to make a creditor of the company aware of the application
by leaving a copy of it at, or posting a copy of it to, the place of business with which the company has had dealings in relation to the current debts, for example, the branch from where
goods were ordered or invoiced. However, if there is more than one such place of business,
Companies House advises that a copy of the application be delivered to each of those places.
They also suggest that it is advisable to keep proof of delivery or posting.
Companies House will examine the form and if it is acceptable will register the information and put it on the companyâ€™s public record. If the Registrar has already started dissolution action under s 1000 (power to strike off company not carrying on business or in
operation), Companies House will not accept the application. However, if the application is
acceptable Companies House will send an acknowledgement to the address shown on the
form and will also notify the company at its registered office address to enable it to object if
the application is bogus.
The Registrar will publish notice of the proposed striking off in the London Gazetteto allow
interested parties the opportunity to object. A copy of this notice will be placed on the companyâ€™s public record. If there is no reason to delay the Registrar will strike the company off
the register not less than three months after the date of the notice. The company will be dissolved on publication of a further notice stating this in the relevant London Gazette.
Restoration to the register by court order
Unless a company is administratively restored to the register, the Registrar can only restore a
company if he receives a court order. Any company which is restored to the register is deemed
to have continued in existence as if it had not been struck off and dissolved. Companies struck
off under s 1000 and the new application arrangements can be restored to the register for
up to 20 years after dissolution (see above). A court order is necessary and application to the
court can be made by interested parties such as creditors, particularly those who did not
receive a copy of the companyâ€™s application for striking off.

Alternatives to winding-up
An interested party may also sometimes be a person who wishes to bring a personal injury
claim against the company. The company will normally have been insured against such
claims, but unless a judgment is obtained against the company, the liability of the insurer to
meet the claim does not arise. The Secretary of State may also restore a company to the register if he considers this to be in the public interest. An application for restoration may be
made by any of the following:
â— any former director, member, creditor or liquidator;
â— any person who had a contractual relationship with the company or who had a potential
legal claim against the company;
â— any person who had an interest in land or property in which the company also had an
interest, right or obligation;
â— any manager or trustee of the companyâ€™s former employeesâ€™ pension fund; or
â— any other person who appears to the court to have an interest in the matter.
Except in cases of personal injury, an application for restoration must be made within six
years of the date of dissolution. In the case of bringing a claim for damages for personal
injury, an application for restoration may be made at any time, but the court may not make
an order for restoration where it appears that the claim would fail due to legal time limits
placed on it.
It was thought that interested parties who may apply for restoration to the register must,
â€˜feel aggrievedâ€™ at the strike off at the time of strike off. It followed, therefore, that a director
who had agreed with the boardâ€™s decision to apply for strike off and who had been instrumental in bringing about the companyâ€™s dissolution could not successfully ask the court to
restore the company to the register (see Conti vUeberseebank AGalso cited Conti, Petitioner
[1998] 11 CL 581).
This decision was reversed on appeal (see Conti v Ueberseebank AG [2000] 4 CL 698)
where it was held that a member applying for restoration did not have to show that he had
been aggrieved at the date of striking off so long as he could establish agrievance at the time
of his applicationto restore the company, such as the possibility of a legal claim.
Outline procedure
Restoration to the register is a matter for the Companies Court, local district registries and
county courts that have jurisdiction to wind up companies. The Registrar of Companies
must also consent and applications for restoration must be served on him at least 10 days
before the court hearing. In this connection, it is important to note that it is the normal
practice of the Registrar to require delivery of outstanding accounts, annual returns and any
other documents in acceptable form before the hearing, before giving his consent to the
application. These documents must be delivered to the Registrar at least five working days
before the hearing. A member of the company must be joined in the application to give
any undertakings required by the Registrar and to be responsible for his costs of the application. If the company to be restored was registered in England or Wales, one must apply
by completing a Part 8 claim form (this is the standard form that starts proceedings).
The Registrar of the Companies Court in London usually hears restoration cases in chambers
once a week on Friday afternoons. Cases are also heard at the District Registries. Alternatively,
you can make an application to a County Court that has the authority to wind up the

Chapter 26 Corporate insolvency - procedures other than rescue
Delay in application to restore to register
Where there is an application to restore a company to the register so that a claim can be
brought against it the claimant should bear in mind that delay in regard to the making of a
petition to the court for restoration may mean that the Limitation Act 1980 has applied
so that the claim is statute-barred and restoration will not be granted. The period from the
companyâ€™s dissolution until the bringing of the restoration proceedings is taken into account
by the court in deciding this issue (see Whitbread (Hotels) Ltd Petitioners 2002 SLT 178).
Offences and penalties
The application provisions must not be used to defraud creditors or for any other wrongful
purpose. Most offences under the new provisions attract a fine of up to Â£5,000 on conviction
before magistrates and an unlimited fine in the Crown Court. If directors deliberately conceal
the application from interested parties, they are liable not only to a fine but up to seven yearsâ€™
imprisonment. There may also be disqualification from being a director, the maximum
period being 15 years.
Name of restored company
The registrar will normally restore a company with the name it had before it was struck off
and dissolved. However, if at the date of restoration the companyâ€™s former name is the same
as another name on the Registrarâ€™s index of company names, the register cannot restore the
company with its former name. If the name is no longer available, the court order may state
another name by which the company is to be restored. As an alternative, the company may
be restored to the register as if its registered company number is also its name. The company
then has 14 days from the date of restoration to pass a resolution to change the name of the
company. It is an offence if the company does not change its name within 14 days of being
restored with the number as its name.
When a company has been restored, the general effect is that a company is deemed to have
continued in existence as if it had not been dissolved or struck off the register. The court may
give directions or make provision to put the company and all other persons in the same position as they were before the company was dissolved and struck off. A notice must also be
placed in the London Gazette.
Administrative Restoration
This is when, under certain conditions, where a company was dissolved because it appeared
to be no longer carrying on business or in operation, a former director or member may apply
to the Registrar to have the company restored. If the Registrar restores the company it is
deemed to have continued in existence as if it had not been dissolved and struck off the register. Section 1025 of the 2006 Act gives details of the requirements relating to Administrative
Restoration.
Administrative Restoration is available where the company was struck off under: s 652 of
the 1985 Act; s 603 of the Companies Consolidation (Consequential Provisions) (Northern
Ireland) Order 1986 (SI 1986/1035 (NI 9); or ss 1000 and 1001 of the 2006 Act. Only a former
director or former member of the company, who was a director or member at the time the

Alternatives to winding-up
company was dissolved, can apply. To be eligible for administrative restoration, the company
must have been struck off the register under the above sections cited and dissolved for no
more than six years as of the date the application for restoration has been received by
the Registrar.
If a company meets the above criteria, an application for restoration may be made if it
meets the following conditions:
â— it must have been carrying on business or in operation at the time it was struck off; and
â— if any property or rights belonging to the company became bona vacantia, the applicant must
provide the Registrar with a statement in writing from the relevant Crown Representative
giving consent to the companyâ€™s restoration.
If the Registrar decides to restore the company, the restoration will take effect from the
date the Registrar sends the notice. The notice will include the companyâ€™s registered number
and the name of the company. If the company is restored under a different name or with the
company number as its name, both that name and the former name shall appear on the notice.

Corporate insolvency - winding-up in

Winding-up by the court
Having outlined the methods of winding-up in terms of a broad overview, we now consider in this chapter the likely course of a winding-up.
Let us assume that we are dealing with a small manufacturing company which has suffered
from a recession in trade and is now in difficulties in terms that its creditors are pressing for
payment which it cannot make. In addition, let us consider the problem from the point of
view of the unsecured or trade creditors who do not wish to appoint an administrator.
Two courses are open to them as follows:
1 To initiate a winding-up by the court. This is slow and expensive.
2 To convince the directors that the company cannot continue in business and that it would
be advantageous to initiate a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up.
Both procedures will be considered in turn. Section references are to the Insolvency Act 1986
unless otherwise stated.
Winding-up by the court
The grounds for compulsory winding-up under s 122 are as follows:
(a) a special resolution by the members to wind up;
(b) failure to start business within one year of incorporation or suspension of business for a
whole year;
(c) if the number of members falls below two, though not in the case of a single-member
(d) if the company is unable to pay its debts;
(e) if it is just and equitable that the company be wound up.
In addition, a newly incorporated public company may be wound up if it does not obtain
a certificate under CA 20 06, s 761 within one year of incorporation. The petition may be presented by the Secretary of State. We have already considered the more important cases under
âž¨ See p. 312 (e) above (see Chapter 16 âž¨).
It is only the fourth ground (which is the commonest and most important) that will be
dealt with in any detail here.
A companyâ€™s inability to pay its debts is defined by s 123 as follows:
(a) If a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding Â£750 has served a
demand in writing for payment and within three weeks the company has failed to pay the
sum due (or given a security or entered into a compromise acceptable to the creditor).
A statutory demand cannot be based on a statute-barred debt, e.g. a contract debt that
is more than six years old, so an action cannot be brought upon it (Re a Debtor (No 50A
SD/95)[1997] 2 All ER 789). A statutory demand cannot be based upon a contingent debt
as where a contract debt is unlikely to be paid but has not yet become due under the contractual provisions for payment (see JSF Finance & Currency Exchange Co Ltd v Akma
Solutions Inc[2001] 2 BCLC 307).
Note that it is not merely the failure to pay the debt which gives the ground for
winding-up. Thus, if a company can satisfy the court that it has a defence to the claim a

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
winding-up order will not be made. In consequence it is advisable for a creditor to sue
the company to judgment before serving a demand for payment of the judgment debt,
though this is not a legal requirement.
(b) If a judgment creditor has tried to enforce his judgment by execution on the companyâ€™s
property and the execution has failed to satisfy the debt.
(c) If the court is satisfied that the company is unable to pay its debts. The following case
provides an example.
Taylors Industrial Flooring Ltdv M & H Plant Hire (Manchester) Ltd
[1990] BCLC 216
M & H supplied plant to Taylors, who were building contractors, in December 1988. M & H invoiced
Taylors in mid-January 1989 but by 14 April 1989 the invoice had not been paid, nor had the second invoice which was issued in February 1989. M & H petitioned for the compulsory winding-up
of Taylors on 14 April. The Court of Appeal held that the petition could proceed. Section 123 was
satisfied. Taylors had no grounds to dispute the debt, and the fact that they might not wish to pay
it was no defence.
This is a useful decision in modern times when companies have collapsed so quickly that the wait
of three weeks for the statutory demand to trigger has seen the companyâ€™s assets dissipated.
Petitioners
For our purposes, six classes of persons can present a petition as follows:
1 the company itself;
2 the Official Receiver who can present a petition even after the commencement of a voluntary winding-up;
3 the Department for Bus iness, Innovation and Skill (BIS), following an investigation;
4 a contributory;
5 a creditor;
6 the Secretary of State for BIS (Secretary of State) where a public company does not obtain
a s 762 (CA 2006) certificate in time.
Only a petition by a contributory or creditor will be considered in any detail here.
(a) Contributory
The following points should be noted:
(i) A contributory is defined as meaning everyone who is liable to contribute to the assets of
the company should it be wound up.
(ii) Although at first sight the term would appear to cover only shareholders whose shares
are partly paid, it applies also to holders of fully paid shares since all members are liable
to contribute subject to any limits on their liability provided for by s 74 of the Insolvency
Act 1986 (Re Anglesey Colliery Co (1886) 1 Ch App 555). The section provides that a
person who has fully paid shares is not liable to contribute but nevertheless he is within

Winding-up by the court
the definition of a contributory. So â€˜contributoryâ€™ is merely another name for â€˜memberâ€™
under s 124.
(iii) Under s 124 a contributory cannot petition unless (a) the number of members is reduced
below two, but not in the case of a single-member company; or (b) he took his shares
as an original allottee; or (c) by transmission from a deceased shareholder; or (d) he
had held the shares for six out of the last 18 months. This is presumably a precaution to
prevent the purchase of shares with a view to an immediate wrecking operation on the
(iv) Finally, a contributory cannot petition unless he has an interest in the process, e.g. it
must be likely that there will be surplus assets. Thus, if a company is insolvent, a contributory cannot petition, though he can and has an interest if, because of the potential
liability for the companyâ€™s debts in a multi-member company, the membership is below
the statutory minimum of two.
(b) Creditors
The following points should be noted:
(i) The creditor is the most usual petitioner. A creditor is a person who is owed money by
the company and who could enforce his claim by an action in debt.
An unliquidated (or unascertained) claim in contract or tort is not enough. Thus it is
better for the creditor petitioner to have the debt made precise as to amount by suing
the company to judgment before winding-up. Then on petition the company cannot, by
reason of the judgment, deny that it owes the money, or that it is an unliquidated sum.
(ii) The debt owed to the creditor to be at leastÂ£750. If it is not, he will no doubt find other
creditors to make a joint petition with him so that the total debt is at least Â£750.
The figure of Â£750 has been adopted by the judiciary from the amount specified in
s 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 though that section does say: â€˜exceeding Â£750â€™.
(iii) Even if the debt on which the petition is based is not disputed, but there are some creditors who think that their best chance of recovering their money lies in the company continuing business, then the court may, in its discretion, refuse a winding-up order. Section
195 gives the court power to have regard to the wishes of the creditors, which in practice
usually means the wishes of the majority in value.
Thus, in Re ABC Coupler & Engineering Ltd[1961] 1 All ER 354 a judgment creditor for
Â£17,540 petitioned as his debt was not paid. He was opposed by various creditors whose
debts were slightly more, namely Â£18,328. The company had extensive goodwill, orders worth
Â£110,000 and its assets were worth almost Â£700,000 more than its liabilities. The court found
that the wishes of the majority for the company to continue were reasonable.
Presentation of the petition
As soon as a petition is presented, the court may under s 135 take charge of the companyâ€™s
affairs by appointing a provisional liquidator. This is usually the Official Receiver.
It is a somewhat drastic measure to appoint a liquidator before the court has made a
winding-up order, but if the companyâ€™s assets are at risk of being dissipated by the directors
it may be done. The role of the Official Receiver as provisional liquidator is to take possession
of the assets and accounting records until the hearing of the petition. Normally the directors
will also be relieved of the companyâ€™s cheque books.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
Avoiding property dispositions in compulsory winding-up
If a winding-up order is made on a petition for compulsory winding-up the commencement
of the winding-up is deemed to be the date of presentation of the petition under what is
known as the principle of â€˜relation backâ€™. If there have been dispositions of the companyâ€™s
property during that period the liquidator may ask the court for an order restoring the property to the company. The directors may have made such dispositions after the petition but
before the making of the order. These dispositions are void under s 127, Insolvency Act 1986
whether the recipient of the property is aware of the presentation of the petition or not. Those
who are aware of it and wish genuinely to deal with the company should ask the court for a
validating order which if given will make the relevant transaction legally enforceable and the
property irrecoverable. In Oxford Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Re[2009] EWHC 1753 (Ch); [2009]
2 BCLC 485, the court concluded that a breach of s 127 is likely to constitute misfeasance on
the part of a company director. Nonetheless, this point must be explicitly alleged otherwise a
failure to do that will preclude a remedy under s 127 against a director unless the director was
the beneficiary of the disposition.
Liquidator
Under s 136 the Official Receiver becomes the liquidator of any company ordered to be
wound up by the court. Section 136 prescribes the steps to be taken to secure the Official
Receiverâ€™s replacement as liquidator by an insolvency practitioner. For this purpose he may
summon meetings of the companyâ€™s creditors and members to choose a person to replace
him and, under s 141, to decide whether to establish a liquidation committee to supervise the
performance by the liquidator of his functions in the winding-up. Alternatively, the Official
Receiver may ask the Secretary of State to make an appointment of a liquidator. If onequarter in value of the companyâ€™s creditors request him at any time to call the meetings of
creditors and members referred to above the Official Receiver must do so.
Under s 139, if the members and creditors nominate different persons to be liquidators,
the creditorsâ€™ nominee becomes liquidator. Where a winding-up order follows immediately
upon the discharge of an administration order, the court may under s 140 appoint the former
administrator to be liquidator.
Statement of affairs
Under s 131, where the court has made a winding-up order or appointed a provisional
liquidator, the Official Receiver may require the submission of a statement of affairs of the
company giving, e.g. particulars of its assets and liabilities and details of its creditors.
The persons who will most usually be called upon to make the statement are the directors
or other officers of the company. However, the 1986 Act empowers the Official Receiver to
require other persons connected with the company to produce or assist in the production of
the statement, e.g. employees or those employed within the last 12 months.
Investigation by the Official Receiver
Section 132 places a duty on the Official Receiver to investigate the affairs of the company and
the reasons for its failure and to make such report, if any, to the court as he thinks fit.

Winding-up by the court
Public examination of officers
Under s 133 the court has power on the application of the Official Receiver to require the public examination of persons connected with the company, e.g. its officers or an administrator.
Those who without reasonable excuse fail to attend the examination may be arrested and
books or papers in their possession seized.
Effect of winding-up
This is as follows:
(a) Immediately an order is made all actions for debt against the company are stopped (s 130).
Actions in tort, e.g. for personal injury from negligence, continue.
(b) The company ceases to carry on business except with a view to a beneficial winding-up.
For example, it may be necessary to carry on the companyâ€™s business for a while in order
to realise its assets at a better price, as by completing work in progress, but realisation
must not be long delayed.
(c) The powers of the directors cease (Fowler v Broads Patent Night Light Co[1893] 1 Ch 724).
(d) Employees are automatically dismissed (Chapmanâ€™s Case (1866) LR 1 Eq 346), though
the liquidator may have to re-employ some of them until the winding-up is completed.
The EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings
The EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings came into force on 31 May 2002. It is directly
applicable in the UK but a number of amendments were required to UK law to accommodate
it. These appear below.
Before the coming into force of the Regulation it was possible to wind up a foreign company with assets in the UK in a UK court. Now the main proceedings are to be conducted
where the company has its centre of main interests. In most cases this will be where the
registered office is. Courts of other member states can open proceedings called territorial
proceedings where the company carries on a non-transitory economic activity with human
means or goods. These proceedings are restricted to assets situated in that member state. The
proceedings affected are winding-up by the court, voluntary winding-up (with confirmation
of the court), administration and voluntary arrangements.
(i) When an insolvency relates only to a person or entity with all of his or its assets in the
same jurisdiction, the Regulation will have no application. In other cases the Regulation
effects a most significant change to insolvency practice and merits careful study.
(ii) Although, under the above rules, courts throughout the EU (except Denmark) will be
forced to recognise and assist insolvency practitioners from other countries, there are
some difficulties, as follows:
â— The rules do not apply to the insolvencies of a group of companies. Since this is the
most common way in which international businesses are structured where there are
operations in different countries, the regulations may not come into effect that often.
â— There will also be arguments over whether the company has its â€˜centre of main operationsâ€™ in a particular country.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
â— The provisions do not apply to insolvency practitioners appointed out of court - such
as administrative receivers - and although these appointments are to be phased out
under the Enterprise Act 2002, that Act does carry provisions under which an administrator may be appointed out of court, e.g. by the directors, and these appointments
may not be covered.
The regulations seem to require a court involvement before proceedings are covered.
UK regulations to ensure compatibility
The UK regulations made to ensure the compatibility of the EC Regulation with UK law
are: the Insolvency Act 1986 (Amendment) (No 2) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/1240) and the
Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2002 (SI 2002/1307).
The regulations: an illustration
If the debtor (corporate or individual) has all the business interests in, say, Chester, proceedings will be commenced in the Chester County Court, or the High Court in the case of a
corporate debtor with a share capital in excess of Â£120,000. These will be main proceedings.
If, however, the debtor has main interests in, say, Paris, with some assets in Chester, the proceedings will be commenced as above but they will be territorial proceedingsand confined to
Chester assets.
The regulations: case law
The High Court has ruled that it could make an administration order against a company
incorporated outside the European Union under the above-mentioned regulations if the centre
of the companyâ€™s main interests was in England (see In Re Brac Rent-A-Car International Inc
[2003] EWHC 128 (CH), [2003] All ER (D) 98 (Feb)). Certain judgment creditors challenged
the jurisdiction of the court on the grounds that the company (which was the petitioner for
administration) was incor porated in Delaware and had its registered address in the USA. The
court accepted that there was no specific reference to companies outside the EU but since
the jurisdiction was defined only in terms of where the petitionerâ€™s main interest lay the court
had jurisdiction. The companyâ€™s operations were conducted almost entirely in England and
its trading contracts were governed by English law. Its employees worked in England and their
contracts were governed by English law.
(i) It would appear that a UK court will, conversely, be denied its traditional jurisdiction to
proceed to total winding-up where the companyâ€™s centre of interest is not in the UK and
be restricted to territorial proceedings confined to local assets.
(ii) Case law is still somewhat confusing on the interpretation to be put on the expression
â€˜centre of main interestsâ€™. In the Brac Rent-a-Carcase the court seems to have laid stress
on where the employees were based and where trading took place and operations were put
into effect, i.e. England. More recently the High Court has reached a conclusion that would
have given the English court jurisdiction because key personnel, e.g. chairman, CEO, chief
financial officer and chief operating officer, were based in London. The headquarters
function played less of a role in the Brac Rent-A-Carcase. A future case will hopefully sort

Voluntary winding-up
out whether high level decision making or lower administration or back office functions
are most important (see King v Crown Energy Trading [2003] EWHC 163 (Comm),
[2003] All ER (D) 133 (Feb) which favoured high level decision making).
Byersv Yacht Bull Corp[2010] EWHC 133 (Ch); [2010] BCC 368 held that a claim asserted
by joint liquidators to the ownership of an asset did not fall within the insolvency exception
in the Judgments Regulation (44/2001) (see Art 1(2)(b)) and as such, the French courts had
jurisdiction over this claim. Nonetheless, a secondary transactional avoidance claim that
relied entirely on provisions contained in the Insolvency Act 1986 did with the end result that
the English courts enjoyed jurisdiction over this transactional avoidance claim by virtue of the
EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (1346/2000) even though this jurisdiction could
not be exercised until the French courts had determined the primary ownership issue. This
position is consistent with the European Court of Justice ruling in Seagon v Deko Marty
Belgium NV (C-339/07)[2009] BCC 347; [2009] 1 WLR 2168.
Voluntary winding-up
This is a more common method of winding-up. If in our situation the directors can be
persuaded to take the view that the company has no future and agree it would be best if its
existence came to an end, then a voluntary winding-up would be a cheaper method of achieving this purpose.
What sort of voluntary winding-up is applicable?
If we want a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up the directors would, as we have seen, have to
make a statutory declaration of solvency, as it is called, in the five weeks before the special resolution for winding-up was passed, or on that date but before the resolution was passed
(s 89). In the declaration they would have to say that in their opinion the company will be able
to pay its debts in full p lus interest within a stated period of time which must not be longer
than 12 months, and a statement of assets and liabilities must be attached. Since the directors
and the members control the process in a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up, there is a strong
temptation for the directors to make a declaration, even if it is not fully justified.
The rate of interest is the rate, if any, in the contract with a creditor, or the interest paid
on unpaid judgments under the Judgments Act 1838, which is currently 8 per cent. This rate
has been in force since 1 April 1993 (see SI 1993/564). The interest is payable from the commencement of the winding-up until payment and can only be paid if all creditors have been
paid the principal sum of their debt in full - in other words, it is payable from surplus assets
which would normally belong to shareholders. If the contract provides for interest, this, along
with the principal sum, will be proved for in the liquidation in the ordinary way.
False declarations - what are the penalties?
Under s 89, if the declaration is made without reasonable grounds the directors are liable to
imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine; andif the debts are not in fact paid within the stated
period it is presumedthat the directors did not have reasonable grounds so that they will have
to prove that they did, which is not an easy matter.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
However, this does not apply to debts which are not fully ascertained. Commonly HMRC
has not completed its assessments and cannot be paid. Nevertheless, if funds are available to
pay such debts when ascertained, the membersâ€™ winding-up continues and there is no need to
convert to a creditorsâ€™, nor are the directors liable for a false declaration.
However, if during a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up the liquidator is of the opinion that
the company will not be able to pay its ascertained debts although a declaration of solvency
has been given, s 95 provides that he must summon a meeting of creditors within 28 days of
that opinion and put before it a statement of assets and liabilities.
As from the date when the liquidator calls the meeting of creditors, the company is deemed
to be in a creditorsâ€™ voluntary, and that meeting may exercise the same powers as a creditorsâ€™
meeting at the beginning of a liquidation which is initiated as a creditorsâ€™ winding-up, including appointing their nominee as liquidator and a liquidation committee.
If he does not follow this procedure, the liquidator is liable to a fine; and if he does, then
the directors are liable to penalties for making a declaration of solvency without reasonable
The liquidator who has been nominated by the company on the basis that there would be
a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up can, between the date of summoning the meeting and the
meeting taking place, act only with the sanction of the court, except for taking all property
under his control to which the company appears entitled. He may also dispose of perishable
goods and do all such other things as may be necessary for the protection of the companyâ€™s
assets but no more.
Filing the declaration of solvency
The declaration must be filed with the Registrar before the expiry of the period of 15 days
immediately following the date on which the resolution for winding up the company is
passed. The company must give the usual 21 daysâ€™ notice to its members of the extraordinary
general meeting to consider the special resolution to wind up voluntarily.
If the statutory declaration is not delivered within the 15-day period, the liquidation
remains a membersâ€™ volu ntary liquidation but the company and its officers are liable to a
default fine under s 89.
Can we use a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up?
Unfortunately, our directors are only too well aware that the company will not be able to pay
its debts within 12 months, so we shall have to have a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up and
proceed as follows under s 84:
(a) Summon an extraordinary general meeting.
(b) Pass an extraordinary resolution that the company cannot by reason of its liabilities
continue in business.
(c) It is the resolution which marks the start of a voluntary winding-up.
(d) The liquidator is appointed by the company if it is a membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up;
in a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up, though the members may by ordinary resolution
have nominated their choice, the creditors have powers to override and appoint their
own nominee, subject to the right of any member or creditor to appeal to the court within
seven days.

The duties of a liquidator
However, even though the members may appoint their choice of liquidator he has only
very limited powers until such time as the creditors have met and confirmed him in office or
not. He can take the companyâ€™s property under his control and dispose of perishable goods
and generally protect the companyâ€™s assets but no more.
If the company nominates five persons for what is called the liquidation committee, both in
a voluntary winding-up and also in a compulsory winding-up, the creditors can now nominate
five more and veto the companyâ€™s nominees, subject again to a right of appeal to the court.
Purpose of liquidation committee
The purpose of such a committee is to provide a small representative body to help the
liquidator. Moreover, if there is a major creditor, who regards the assets of the company as
virtually his own, the committee may provide him with a useful safety valve. The liquidator
becomes involved in many kinds of businesses but a major creditor, with his knowledge of the
trade, can control the committee, and supervise the winding-up, and see that the run-down
of the company is carried out to the best advantage. Since a liquidation committee can exercise certain powers, such as, for example, approving payment to any class of creditors, it will
save the liquidator the necessity of calling a full meeting of creditors, whose approval would
otherwise be necessary.
From now on we will combine consideration of the compulsory and voluntary winding-up
The duties of a liquidator
Appointment
The following points should be noted:
(a) If it is a compulsory winding-up, the Official Receiver, who automatically became provisional liquidator on the winding-up order (if not earlier on the presentation of the
petition), will commonly continue as the liquidator.
(b) In the case of a voluntary winding-up, a person, other than a corporate body or a
bankrupt, can be appointed, provided he is a qualified insolvency practitioner (see
âž¨ See p. 578 further Chapter 26 âž¨). The liquidator is usually an experienced accountant.
(c) In a voluntary winding-up, the liquidator will have to notify his appointment to the
Registrar of Companies and publish it in the London Gazette, both within 14 days.
General position of the liquidator
Section 143 states that the functions of the liquidator of a company which is being wound
up by the courtshall be to ensure that the assets of the company are got in, realised and distributed to the companyâ€™s creditors, and, if there is a surplus, to the persons entitled to it.
Beyond this there is no clear definition of his role; it is a mixture of common law and statutory duties and obligations. He partakes partly of the nature of a trustee, partly of an agent of
the company and partly of an officer of the company.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
(a) As a trustee
A liquidator is clearly not a trustee in the sense of the Trustee Act 1925, because the property
of the company does not automatically vest in him as does trust property in trustees, although
the court can make an order so vesting it. However, he takes over the powers of directors who
equally, without being trustees, owe fiduciary duties to the company. His duty, like that of
the directors, is owed to the company as a whole and not to individual contributories. Also,
like a trustee, he cannot, by reason of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (which have been in part
amended by The Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2010 (SI 2010 No. 686)), buy the companyâ€™s
property without leave of the court, or make a profit out of sales to the company. Moreover,
he is in a more vulnerable position than a lay trustee because he is always paid to assume his
responsibility and in Re Home & Colonial Insurance Co [1929] All ER Rep 231 the court
referred to the â€˜high standard of care and diligenceâ€™ required from him. â€˜His only refuge was
to apply to the court for guidance in every case of serious doubt or difficulty.â€™
Furthermore, although it has not been definitely decided, it does not appear that the liquidator can claim the protection of s 61 of the Trustee Act 1925 if he has acted honestly and
reasonably and ought to be excused. In Re Windsor Steam Coal Ltd[1929] 1 Ch 151 the Court
of Appeal held on the facts that the liquidator had not acted reasonably in paying a claim
without the directions of the court, but left open the question of whether s 61 was available as
a defence.
(b) As an agent
The liquidator can be described as an agent for the company in that he can make contracts on
behalf of the company for winding-up purposes.
He has, of course, the paid agentâ€™s obligation to bring reasonable skill to his duties.
However, he is not a true agent in that he controls the actions of his so-called principal, the
(c) As an officer
The liquidator is treated as an officer of the company in s 30(4), CA 2006. He or she is also
named in s 212 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as a person against whom proceedings may be
taken for misfeasance, which will be referred to again later. Neither is it certain that he or she
is entitled to the protection of the Companies Acts whereby the court can relieve any officer
who, though negligent or in breach of trust, has acted honestly and reasonably and ought to
be relieved. We have already seen an example of this section in operation in In Re Duomatic
âž¨ See p. 379 (1969) (see Chapter 19 âž¨).
Control by the court
Finally, the liquidator is subject to constant control by the court because any person aggrieved
by an action or decision of a liquidator in a winding-up may apply to the court. However,
it would seem that the court is not anxious to upset his acts. Thus, in Leonv York-O-Matic
[1966] 3 All ER 277, where the liquidator was charged by a member of the company with
selling assets at an undervalue, the judge said that in the absence of fraud there could not
be interference in the day-to-day administration of the liquidator, nor a questioning of the
exercise by the liquidator in good faith of his discretion, nor a holding him accountable for
an error of judgment.

The duties of a liquidator
Powers of the liquidator
The following points should be noted:
(a) In a compulsory winding-up, s 167 provides that something like half of his powers can
only be exercised with the approval of the court or of the liquidation committee, e.g. to
bring or defend actions, to carry on the business of the company so far as may be necessary for its beneficial winding-up, and to pay any class of creditors in full. Otherwise he
can do most acts on his own authority, e.g. sell the companyâ€™s property or raise money
on the security of the companyâ€™s assets.
(b) In a creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up, he can exercise all the powers on his own except
three which need the sanction of the court, the liquidation committee or the creditors.
These powers are: to pay creditors; to make a compromise with creditors; and to compromise calls and debts (s 165).
(c) While the liquidator in a voluntary winding-up has a freedom from supervision by the
court which is not available in a compulsory winding-up, he can always get support and
guidance by applying to the court on any matter arising out of the winding-up (s 112).
Centrebinding
In the past, when no particular qualifications were required to undertake insolvency work, it
was possible for the members in a creditorsâ€™ voluntary to appoint a liquidator from among a
group of unscrupulous persons prepared to participate in fraud. The person appointed would
then proceed to dispose of the company assets and dissipate the proceeds often into other
enterprises of the directors or their associates. This was done without the holding of a creditorsâ€™ meeting to affirm the appointment of the liquidator, and by the time the creditors
became aware of the liquidation it was too late to do anything about it. The difficulty was that
the disposal of the assets by the membersâ€™ liquidator was quite legal. The court so decided in
Re Centrebind[1966] 3 All ER 889 and the procedure became known as â€˜centrebindingâ€™.
The practice had been brought to an end for two reasons as follows:
(a) the requirement of qualified insolvency practitioners; and
(b) because of s 166, which provides that until a meeting of creditors has been called to
approve the companyâ€™s liquidator, that liquidator has power only to take control of
the companyâ€™s property and to sell perishable goods. Any other dispositions of the
companyâ€™s property are invalid.
Collection of the assets
(a) The liquidator will take charge of all assets which can be physically brought under his
control, including money in the bank.
(b) He will not be able to touch money subject to a trust. Thus, in Re Kayford[1975] 1 All
ER 604 a mail order company in anticipation of liquidation had put customersâ€™ deposits
for goods which the company might not be able to supply in a special â€˜Customer Trade
Deposit Accountâ€™ and it was held that these deposits were returnable to the customers
and did not come under the control of the liquidator. However, if there are any other
assets in the hands, for example, of a sheriff, who is intending to sell the goods as part of
a judgment creditorâ€™s execution, the liquidator will be able to recover these assets if the
process of sale has not been completed before the winding-up commenced.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
(c) The liquidator will normally in a compulsory winding-up pay all money into the Insolvency
Services Account at the Bank of England, but in a voluntary winding-up he need not do
so unless he has in his hands assets unclaimed or undistributed for six months.
(d) He can bring actions to enforce debts due to the company.
(e) He will settle the list of contributories and he can ask the court to exercise its
powers under s 237 to order an officer or any person who has previously held office as
administrator or liquidator of the company or as an administrative receiver and any
trustee for or any banker or agent or officer of the company to hand over any property
or money or books, papers or records of the company under his control. Set-off is not
allowed to a contributory until all the creditors have been paid in full. In the unlikely
event of there being uncalled capital, he can call it up, and will settle the A list of present members and the B list of persons who have been members in the 12 months
preceding winding-up. The B list members will only be liable for debts contracted while
they were members to the extent that their successors failed to pay the balance due on
their shares.
Officers: co-operation with liquidator
It was held by the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in R v McCredie[2000] BCLC 438 that
the companyâ€™s directors and other officers are required by s 208(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986
to co-operate with the liquidator in terms of the ascertainment and delivery up of the companyâ€™s property, not merely in a reactive manner but proactively. The requirement to deliver
up does not depend on a prior request from the liquidator. It is a continuing and not a oncefor-all-time duty. Failure to act in a proactive way can, as this case decides, be a criminal
offence under s 208 punishable with imprisonment or a fine.
Swelling the assets
It is the duty of the liquidator, subject to the problems outlined below, to swell the assets by
recovering any sums due from the directors or officers of the company. His ability to recover
may arise under a number of headings as follows:
(a) Secret profits
It may be that the directors have made an unauthorised profit out of their position. As we saw
in Regal (Hastings) Ltdv Gulliver, 1942, the directors had helped the parent company out by
putting up money for shares in a subsidiary company, but were made to repay to the parent
company a profit on those shares when they were sold. Alternatively, the directors may have
paid themselves unauthorised salaries which may be recovered. As we have seen, officers of
the company can be summoned before the court for examination if they are suspected of
having property of the company in their possession.
(b) Wrongful and fraudulent trading
The companyâ€™s officers, and others, may be held personally liable for certain debts of the company under the rules relating to wrongful and fraudulent trading. If the liquidator recovers
money under the above heads, it goes into a fund for all the creditors (Re William C Leitch
Ltd (No 2)[1933] Ch 261). In the past if an individual creditor, such as the Revenue, was paid
his debt by the directors as a result of his bringing an application for, say, fraudulent trading,

The duties of a liquidator
then he could keep the money (Re Cyona Distributors[1967] 1 All ER 281). This will not arise
now because only the liquidator may apply, under the relevant sections.
(c) Power to conduct examinations
Section 212 allows the court on the application of the Official Receiver, the liquidator, a creditor or a contributory to examine the conduct of any promoter, past or present director, manager, liquidator, administrator, administrative receiver or officer of the company. If it appears
that such a person has misapplied or retained or become liable or accountable for any money
or property of the company, or been guilty of any misfeasance or breach of trust in relation
to the company, the court can order him to repay or restore or to contribute to the assets of
the company by way of compensation such a sum as the court thinks just.
Corporate claims in liquidation
Although, in general terms, a liquidator will wish to swell the assets by recovering sums under
the headings mentioned above, it should be noted that it is, generally speaking, unwise for a
liquidator to enter into litigation for the company. First, because legal aid has been abolished
in civil matters (except for family and clinical negligence cases). In addition, the Access to
Justice Act 1999 specifically provides in s 6 and Sch 2, para 1(g) that the new Legal Services
Commission shall not fund â€˜matters of company or partnership lawâ€™, or under para 1(h) â€˜other
matters arising from the carrying on of a businessâ€™. Second, because the Court of Appeal ruled
in Mond v Hammond Suddards[2000] Ch 40 that the cost of an unsuccessful litigation will
not be treated as an expense of the liquidation, even though the liquidator had not acted in any
way improperly in defending a claim by the companyâ€™s receiver in regard to title to certain of
the companyâ€™s property. As regards conditional fee arrangements (the no-win no-fee concept), these require security for costs by the litigant or the making of a single premium insurance arrangement which admittedly is recoverable from the defendant (if he has funds) where
the action is successful but not otherwise. So costs remain a problem even where the lawyer
receives no fee if the claim is lost. â€˜Lawyerâ€™ means the solicitor in the case. Separate arrangements
are required with a barrister to take the case in court unless the solicitor is also an advocate.
Thus cases that have a good chance of success will continue to be brought if funded by creditors but perhaps rarely otherwise. Litigation funding agreements are dealt with by s 28 of the
Access to Justice Act 1999, which inserts a new s 58B into the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990.
The ruling in the Mond case was affirmed in Lewis v Inland Revenue Commissioners
(2000) The Times, 15 November. The Court of Appeal ruled in that case that a liquidator had
no automatic right to recoup litigation costs. A companyâ€™s liquidator attempting to use the
companyâ€™s realised funds for the purpose of taking proceedings against directors for wrongful trading or the recovery of a preference could not automatically regard the cost as an
expense of the liquidation and payable before all other claims under s 115, IA 1986. The liquidatorâ€™s right to recoup was subject to making an application to the court, under s 112 (voluntary liquidation) or s 156 (compulsory liquidation), for the court to exercise its power
under those sections as relevant to dictate a different order of priority of payment in terms of
allowing recoupment of litigation costs at the courtâ€™s discretion.
The law is obviously anxious to look at each case on its merits. Even where the case is good,
litigation is, after all, unpredictable and can be a very quick way to lose the companyâ€™s funds.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
Creditors - proof of debts
The following points should be noted:
1 The liquidator will normally have written to every known creditor on first appointment,
sending him a copy of the statement of affairs, and he will advertise in the London Gazette
and a local newspaper (Insolvency Rules 1986) for details of debts to be submitted within
a definite period, and he will normally require debts to be verified by affidavit. Then he will
examine and decide on every debt, and a rejected creditor can appeal to the court.
2 The admission of debts will depend on whether the company is solvent or not. If the company is solvent, all debts can be proved which could have been enforced against the company if it had not gone into liquidation. However, statute-barred debts are only payable
if all the members agree, and future debts are payable subject to a rebate of 5 per cent per
annum because they are paid early.
3 If the company is insolvent, the following rules apply and certain debts are nonprovable
as follows:
(a) Claims for unliquidated damages in tort. Damages for breach of contract or trust are
provable on an estimate. Thus, if a claim can be framed in either contract or tort, as
might be the case where injury was caused to a person by the negligence of a company
driver, it may be possible to include the claim as one of contract rather than of tort.
This is a useful rule for a liquidator because in a compulsory liquidation he does not
have to await the outcome of tort proceedings before winding up the company,
though, as we have seen, an order can be made by the court restoring it to the Register
so that a formal claim may be made against it to trigger its insurance companyâ€™s duty
to indemnify the company against the claim. However, in Re Islington Metal and
Plating Works[1983] 3 All ER 218, Harman J decided that if a company which started
liquidation as insolvent later became solvent, where, as in this case, an action by the
liquidator on behalf of the company against its directors for misfeasance might succeed, debts of all descriptions could be proved. In such a situation, once the claims of
the undoubted creditors were satisfied and the costs provided for, the tort claimants
would be entitled to make claims before distribution of any surplus. Membersâ€™ and
creditorsâ€™ voluntaries must be kept open while tort claims are quantified.
(b) Debts incurred after notice of a transaction at undervalue or preference (see below), or
if the company could not pay its debts as they fell due and had suspended payment
(c) Contingent debts when the value cannot be fairly estimated. In Re Patent Floor Cloth
Co(1872) 26 LT 467, two persons Dean and Gilbert were employed by the company
as travellers for a period of three years on commission. In the first year they made Â£400
each and then the company was wound up. The court held that an estimate could be
made of their entitlement to commission for the purposes of the winding-up but this
would have been impossible if there had not been a first year commission on which to
(d) Debts barred by the Limitation Act 1980 at the commencement of winding-up are not
enforceable, though time stops running on the commencement of the liquidation and
if the debt is not statute-barred then it will not become so because of delay in payment
arising out of the liquidation.
(e) Illegal debts and unenforceable debts are not provable. For example, a debt on a contract for the sale of land which is not in writing as is required by the Law of Property

The duties of a liquidator
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 is not provable. Nor would an illegal debt be
provable as where a builder has built premises for a company knowing that there was
no planning permission.
If a debt cannot be proved, the creditor gets no dividend and has no rights as a creditor,
e.g. to attend and vote at meetings.
There are also certain deferred debts. These are provable but no dividend is payable nor is
there a right to vote until all provable debts have been paid with interest (see below). The
deferred debts are as follows:
(a) loans under a written agreement that the lender is to receive a rate of interest varying with
the profits of the company; and
(b) where the vendor of a business sold to the company is receiving a share of the profits as
The Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930 as amended
by The Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 2010
A method of circumventing a liquidation by a creditor is to be found in the above Act, which
has been the subject of a Law Commission consultation paper. If a worker is injured by his
employerâ€™s negligence and the employer is a company that goes into liquidation, the 1930 Act
allows the injured worker to make a claim against the companyâ€™s insurer, thus avoiding a
proof in the companyâ€™s liquidation which might only produce a small payment covering only
part of the claim.
However, the claim against the insurer is by no means straightforward since the insurer is
only liable to indemnify the company. Therefore, the worker must sue the company to establish its liability before the insurance company is obliged to pay. This may mean an action at
law to restore the company to the register if it has been struck off on liquidation and another
action against the company to establish its liability. It may then be necessary to bring a legal
action against the insurance company if it disputes liability.
The Law Commissio n and the Scottish Law Commission published a joint report (Law
Com No 272/Scot Law Com No 184) on 31 July 2001. The report recommended the repeal of
the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930 and its replacement with a new Act that
would make it easier for a third party to obtain a remedy as well as provide that the third party
should not have to take legal proceedings to restore a company to the register.
The Law Commissionsâ€™ recommendations were accepted by Government in 2002, and the
Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Bill was introduced in Parliament in November 2009.
The Bill proceeded through Parliament via a trial procedure for Law Commission bills, and
received Royal Assent on 25 March 2010.
The key changes made by Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 2010are:
â— A new court procedure is available to third parties. The third party has a right to seek
declarations as to the insuredâ€™s liability to them and as to the insurerâ€™s potential liability
under the insurance contract in one set of proceedings. If the court or tribunal makes
such declarations, it will be able to make an appropriate judgment which is likely to be
a money judgment. This mechanism is optional; the third party may alternatively bring
proceedings against the insured before commencing proceedings against the insurer (as
at present).

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
â— The third party will no longer be obliged to join the insured in proceedings against the
insurer; but if this is not done where a declaration is made regarding the insuredâ€™s liability
to the third party, it will not bind the insured.
Position of secured creditors
As regards secured creditors, a secured creditor must state in his proof that he is a secured
creditor and either:
(i) surrender the security and prove for the whole debt as an unsecured creditor; or
(ii) value the security and prove for the balance which then remains as an unsecured
If the creditor values the security and proves for the balance, then the liquidator may (a)
redeem the security by paying the creditor the amount of the valuation, or (b) require the
security to be sold by auction to establish its value.
The creditor may at any time after lodging his proof by notice in writing require the
liquidator to choose between (a) and (b) above. The liquidator then has six months from
receipt of the notice to make a choice. If he does not make a choice, the creditor owns the
security at his valuation and may prove for the balance as an unsecured creditor.
Under s 189 the surplus remaining in any winding-up after payment in full of proved debts
is to be applied in the payment of interest to the extent specified on the amount of those debts
before it is available for members. The rate of interest payable under the section in respect of
any debt is whichever is the greater of:
(a) the rate specified in s 17 of the Judgments Act 1838 on the day on which the company
went into liquidation (currently 8 per cent per annum (SI 1993/564)); and
(b) the rate applicable to that debt apart from the winding-up, e.g. the contract rate of
interest, if any.
The court may on the application of the liquidator vary or set aside any extortionate credit
transaction between the co mpany and a creditor.
Provisions which may invalidate a charge or debt
There are various provisions, some of which have been considered briefly already, which may
invalidate a charge granted by the company or any other disposition it has made or any debt
which it has incurred. These are as follows:
(a) A charge will be invalid against the liquidator or creditors if it is not registered under the
Companies Act 2006 within 21 days with the Registrar. If it is invalid the holder falls to
the level of an unsecured creditor.
(b) Section 241 enables the court on the application of the liquidator to make orders for
restoring the position of the company and its creditors to what it would have been if the
company had not entered into a transaction at an undervalue or given a preference to a
creditor before the commencement of the winding-up. Preferences within six months
from the commencement of winding-up can be set aside. The period is two years if with
a connected person, e.g. a director. Transactions at undervalue made up to two years
before can be set aside whether the recipient was connected with the company or not.

The duties of a liquidator
The Act applies to the creation of a charge and to any delivery of goods or the payment
of money. A simple example from previous legislation of a preference is Re Kushler [1943]
2 All ER 22, where ordinary creditors were ignored but the company paid some Â£700
into the bank merely to clear the overdraft guaranteed by the directors. Repayment was
(c) As we have seen, a floating charge created by a company within the year before the commencement of its winding-up or within two years if given to a connected person, e.g.
a director, may be void.
The purpose of this section appears to be similar to a preference to prevent a company,
while it is unable to pay its debts, from preferring an unsecured creditor by giving him a floating charge on its assets.
(d) Consider the impact that ss 39-40 of CA 2006 (a companyâ€™s capacity and powers of
directors to bind a company) will have to eliminate the availability of a liquidator claiming a debt is invalid because it is ultra vires. The problem of an ultra viresobligation will
fall to the wayside in the future to the extent that post-2006 Act companies will not have
memorandums with object clauses in them anyhow. An ultra vires debt is invalid and
the liquidator need not pay it, though the creditor may follow and trace his property
into the companyâ€™s assets. See the recent case of Progress Property Co Ltdv Moore[2009]
EWCA Civ 629; [2010] 1 BCLC 1 (in which the particular transaction under attack was
actually held to be intra vires) as an example of the general company law treatment of
ultra vires.
The Companies Act 2006 will now operate to render most transactions valid. The position
âž¨ See p. 79 under the 2006 Act was considered in Chapter 3 âž¨.
(e) If the liquidator can prove fraudulent trading or wrongful trading against, for example,
a director or officer under the Insolvency Act 1986, which have already been considered,
the court may order that person to become personally liable for the debt. (Note also man-
âž¨ See p. 412 agement by disquali fied persons, in Chapter 20 âž¨.)
(f) Finally, the liquidator has a very powerful weapon in the right to disclaim given to him
by ss 178 and 179. The sections allow him to disclaim property, e.g. stock or shares,
unprofitable contracts, property unsaleable or not readily saleable or land burdened with
onerous covenants. As regards the latter, an illustration is provided by Re Nottingham
General Cemetery Co [1955] 2 All ER 504 where contracts between the company and
the owners of the grave plots prevented its use for a purpose other than a cemetery. The
liquidator can, of course, disclaim such land, and if he does it vests in the Crown subject
to the right of any interested party, e.g. a local authority, to ask that the land be vested
The liquidator must disclaim in writing within 12 months (this does not apply if he is the
Official Receiver) and if he hesitates, anyone concerned can ask him to decide within 28 days
what he will do. If he fails to tell the court within 28 days that he intends to disclaim he will
lose his right. The court can assist persons affected by the disclaimer because, although they
can no longer prove as creditors in the liquidation, they are entitled to damages. These damages may or may not equal the full amount of the debt. An illustration taken from the law of
bankruptcy, which is the same on this point, is set out below.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
Re Hooley, ex parte United Ordnance and Engineering Co Ltd[1899] 2 QB 579
Hooleyâ€™s trustee in bankruptcy disclaimed certain unpaid shares which Hooley held in the company, the shares being of low value. Hooley owed Â£25,000 under the contract to take the shares.
The court assessed the damages payable to the company on the basis of the companyâ€™s indebtedness. It appeared that the gross amount owed by the company was Â£16,169. The court deducted
from this the cash in hand of Â£4,000 and directorsâ€™ fees owing of Â£1,669, leaving a balance of
Held- this was the measure of damages which the company could prove for in the bankruptcy.
Distribution of assets
The liquidator is now able to distribute the assets. The order laid down for a compulsory
winding-up under the Insolvency Rules is usually followed. The order is as follows:
1 First come the costs of the winding-up. In broad terms these cover the costs of getting in
the assets, of the petition, of making the statement of affairs, the liquidatorâ€™s remuneration
and the expenses of the committee of inspection.
2 Then come the preferential debts (see Insolvency Act 1986, Sch 6). These debts rank
equally between themselves so that if the property of the company is not sufficient to pay
them all in full they will have to abate proportionately. The preferential debts are as
(a) wages or salaries of employees due within four months next before the relevant date
up to a maximum of Â£800 for each employee;
(b) all accrued holiday remuneration of employees;
(c) it should be noted that assessed taxes are no longer preferential and also that if a bank
has provided funds to pay wages and salaries that debt becomes preferential under the
rule of subrogation;
(d) contributions to an occupational pension fund.
3 Next come charges, sec ured by a floating charge, which take second place to preferential
creditors. Fixed chargeholders are not subject to the claims of preferential creditors.
4 These are followed by the unsecured ordinary creditors. It should be noted that secured
creditors are paid before the unsecured creditors if the liquidator is allowed to sell the
assets charged. This is, however, rare because secured creditors, e.g. fixed chargeholders,
normally appoint a receiver to sell the assets charged, returning any surplus after sale to the
liquidator. If there is a shortfall and the proceeds of sale do not cover the debt, the secured
creditors prove for the balance as unsecured creditors, as they do if they surrender the
security to the liquidator.
In order to ensure that the abolition of the preferential status of Crown debts does not
go solely to floating chargeholders the Enterprise Act 2002 set up a mechanism for ringfencing a percentage of assets for unsecured creditors. The reform made under the Enterprise Act
2002 substantially restricts the use of receivership and channels the enforcement of floating
charges into the administrative procedure, a general procedure for handling insolvent companies that is not specific to enforcement of a floating charge. These provisions that apply
âž¨ See p. 562 in all corporate insolvencies have already been detailed in Chapter 25 âž¨ in the materials on
administration.

The duties of a liquidator
5 Lastly come the deferred debts. These have already been referred to but one could add at
this stage sums due to members in their capacity as members, such as dividends declared
but not paid.
If there is money left at this stage, the company is solvent and debts such as unliquidated
damages in tort will be admitted and paid when quantified by the court.
Finally, any surplus will be distributed among members according to their rights under the
articles or the terms of issue of their shares.
Insolvency: protection of employees
Under ss 166-168 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 an employee who loses his job when
his employer (in this case a company) becomes insolvent can claim through the National
Insurance Fund arrears of wages, holiday pay and certain other payments which are owed to
him, rather than rely on the preferential payments procedure.
Any payments made must be authorised by the Secretary of State and the legal rights
and remedies in respect of the debts covered are transferred to the Secretary of State, so that
he can try to recover from the assets of the insolvent employer the costs of any payments
made, up to the preferential rights the employees would have had. Major debts covered are
as follows:
(a) Arrears of wages for a period not exceeding eight weeks up to a rate of Â£380 per week. The
definition of wages includes the same items as are mentioned above.
(b) Pay in respect of holidays actually taken, and accrued holiday pay up to a rate of Â£380 per
week, up to a limit of six weeks.
(c) Payments in lieu of notice at a rate not exceeding Â£380 a week, up to the statutory minimum entitlement of a particular employee under the Employment Rights Act 1996 (one
week after one calendar monthâ€™s service rising to one week per year of service up to a
maximum of 12 weeks (new earnings will be taken into account)).
(d) Any payment outstanding in regard to an award by an employment tribunal of compensation for unfair dismissal.
(e) Reimbursement of any fee or premium paid by an apprentice or articled clerk.
There is no qualifying period before an employee becomes eligible and virtually all people
in employment are entitled.
Completion of winding-up
The final stages of the winding-up are as follows:
(a) Compulsory winding-up. Once the liquidator has paid off the creditors and distributed the
surplus (if any) and summoned a final meeting of the companyâ€™s creditors, under s 146
he may vacate office and obtain his release. The company is dissolved at the end of three
months from the receipt by the Registrar of the liquidatorâ€™s notice that the final meeting
of creditors has been held and that the liquidator has vacated office.
(b) Voluntary winding-up. In a voluntary winding-up the liquidator will call final meetings
of the company and creditors for approval of his accounts. Within a week he will file
with the Registrar his accounts and a return of the meetings, and under s 201, two months
later the company is dissolved.

Chapter 27 Corporate insolvency - winding-up in context
Whether it is a compulsory or voluntary liquidation, the court can restore the company to
âž¨ See p. 588 the register. The law relating to this has already been considered at Chapter 26 âž¨.
We have now completed a consideration of the two main methods of winding-up. However, it is possible for a company which is in voluntary liquidation to be compulsorily wound
up and this is referred to in the next section.
Compulsory winding-up by a company in voluntary
liquidation
The following points should be noted:
(a) A voluntary winding-up does not by reason of s 116 bar the right of a creditor or contributory to have the company wound up by the court, though it is necessary to show one
of the grounds for a compulsory winding-up. If a creditor applies to the court, the court
will take into account the wishes of all the creditors and the majority view would almost
certainly prevail. In the case of contributories, the Act provides that the court must be
satisfied that the rights of contributories will be prejudiced by a voluntary winding-up
and that a compulsory order would be justified if, for example, the voluntary winding-up
was being conducted in a fraudulent manner or there were suspicious circumstances and
a searching investigation was required.
(b) Under s 124 the Official Receiver may present a petition but the court will not order
winding-up unless it is satisfied that the voluntary winding-up cannot be continued with
due regard to the interests of the creditors and contributories. Thus, in Re Ryder
Installations[1966] 1 All ER 453 the liquidator in a voluntary winding-up had not after
eight years called a meeting of creditors and he had five convictions for failing to make
the appropriate returns. Here the court ordered a compulsory winding-up by the court.
(c) The Secretary of State can also present a petition for a compulsory winding-up after a voluntary winding-up has been started. Thus, in Lubin, Rosen & Associates[1975] 1 All ER
577 the Secretary of St ate for Trade and Industry petitioned because an investigation suggested there had been fraud and the company, formed to build flats in Spain, never had
sufficient share capital for its activities. In the event, 198 creditors with claims totalling
Â£540,000 opposed compulsory winding-up. Megarry J held that while such opposition by
creditors was a formidable obstacle, the petition of the Secretary of State carried great
weight and that when there were circumstances of suspicion it was highly desirable that
the winding-up should be by the court with all the safeguards that that provided.
Consequently, he ordered a compulsory winding-up.

2 Deadloss plc has gone into insolvent winding-up. The petition was presented on 1 April 2005
and the winding-up order was made on 30 May 2005. The liquidator is uncertain as to the priorities and whether the following transactions are binding on him:
(a) Deadloss created a floating charge on its undertaking and assets on 1 January 2004 to
secure a loan of Â£500,000 from Financings Ltd. The charge contained a clause restricting
Deadloss from creating any further charges ranking in priority or pari passu with it. This
charge was duly registered within the requisite period.
(b) On 1 June 2004 Deadloss created a fixed charge over its land and buildings in favour of
Easymoney to secure a loan of Â£200,000. The charge was not dated and, owing to an oversight, not registered either. The oversight was discovered on 10 July 2004. The secretary
of Deadloss promptly filled in the date as 10 July 2004 and had the charge registered,
obtaining a certificate of registration from the Registrar of Charges.
(c) Deadloss had accumulated a debt of Â£100,000 with Suppliers Ltd. In order to ensure uninterrupted supplies of raw materials and to prevent an anticipated petition for winding up
the company, Deadloss created a floating charge over its assets on 10 January 2005, in favour
of Suppliers Ltd. The charge was duly registered within 21 days of execution.

so payable, at the appropriate rate (as defined in the Act) from the date of forfeiture until payment but the directors may waive payment wholly or in part or enforce payment without any
allowance for the value of the shares at the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received
on their disposal.
22. A statutory declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been forfeited on a
specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share and the declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer if necessary) constitute a good title to the share and the person to whom the
share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the application of the consideration, if any,
nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings
in reference to the forfeiture or disposal of the share.
Transfer of shares
23. The instrument of transfer of a share may be in any usual form or in any other form
which the directors may approve and shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and,
unless the share is fully paid, by or on behalf of the transferee.
24. The directors may refuse to register the transfer of a share which is not fully paid to a
person of whom they do not approve and they may refuse to register the transfer of a share
on which the company has a lien. They may also refuse to register a transfer unless -
(a) it is lodged at the office or at such other place as the directors may appoint and is accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
(b) it is in respect of only one class of shares; and
(c) it is in favour of not more than four transferees.
25. If the directors refuse to register a transfer of a share, they shall within two months after
the date on which the transfer was lodged with the company send to the transferee notice of
the refusal.
26. The registration of transfers of shares or of transfers of any class of shares may be suspended at such times and for such periods (not exceeding thirty days in any year) as the directors may determine.
27. No fee shall be charged for the registration of any instrument of transfer or other document relating to or affecting the title to any share.
28. The company shall be entitled to retain any instrument of transfer which is registered, but
any instrument of transfer which the directors refuse to register shall be returned to the person lodging it when notice of the refusal is given.

Transmission of shares
29. If a member dies the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, and his personal
representatives where he was a sole holder or the only survivor of joint holders, shall be the
only persons recognised by the company as having any title to his interest; but nothing herein
contained shall release the estate of a deceased member from any liability in respect of any
share which had been jointly held by him.
30. A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a
member may, upon such evidence being produced as the directors may properly require, elect
either to become the holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered
as the transferee. If he elects to become the holder he shall give notice to the company to that
effect. If he elects to have another person registered he shall execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person. All the articles relating to the transfer of shares shall apply to
the notice or instrument of transfer as if it were an instrument of transfer executed by the
member and the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred.
31. A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a
member shall have the rights to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of the share,
except that he shall not, before being registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in
respect of it to attend or vote at any meeting of the company or at any separate meeting of the
holders of any class of shares in the company.
Alteration of share capital
32. The company may by ordinary resolution -
(a) increase its share capital by new shares of such amount as the resolution prescribes;
(b) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its
existing shares;
(c) subject to the provisions of the Act, sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of
smaller amount and the resolution may determine that, as between the shares resulting from
the sub-division, any of them may have any preference or advantage as compared with the
others; and
(d) cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or
agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount
of the shares so cancelled.
33. Whenever as a result of a consolidation of shares any members would become entitled to
fractions of a share, the directors may, on behalf of those members, sell the shares representing the fractions for the best price reasonably obtainable to any person (including, subject
to the provisions of the Act, the company) and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proportion among those members, and the directors may authorise some person to execute an
instrument of transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser.
The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall
his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in
reference to the sale.
34. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the company may by special resolution reduce its
share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account in any way.

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
Purchase of own shares
35. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the company may purchase its own shares (including any redeemable shares) and, if it is a private company, make a payment in respect of the
redemption or purchase of its own shares otherwise than out of distributable profits of the
company or the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares.
General meetings
37. The directors may call general meetings and, on the requisition of members pursuant
to the provisions of the Act, shall forthwith proceed to convene a general meeting in accordance with the provisions of the Act. If there are not within the United Kingdom sufficient
directors to call a general meeting, any director or any member of the company may call a
general meeting.
Notice of general meetings
38. An annual general meeting shall be called by at least twenty-one clear daysâ€™ notice. All
other general meetings shall be called by at least fourteen clear daysâ€™ notice but a general meeting may be called by shorter notice if is so agreed -
(a) in the case of an annual general meeting, by all the members entitled to attend and vote
thereat; and
(b) in the case of any other meeting by a majority in number of the members having a right
to attend and vote being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five per cent in
nominal value of the shares giving that right.
The notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting and the general nature of the business
to be transacted and, in the case of an annual general meeting, shall specify the meeting as such.

the death or bankruptcy of a member and to the directors and auditors.
39. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of notice of a
meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at that
Proceedings at general meetings
40. No business shall be transacted at any meeting unless a quorum is present. Two persons
entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted, each being a member or a proxy for a
member or a duly authorised representative of a corporation, shall be a quorum.
41. If such a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the
meeting, or if during a meeting such a quorum ceases to be present, the meeting shall stand
adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and place or to such time and
place as the directors may determine.
42. The chairman, if any, of the board of directors or in his absence some other director nominated by the directors shall preside as chairman of the meeting, but if neither the chairman

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
nor such other director (if any) be present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for
holding the meeting and willing to act, the directors present shall elect one of their number to
be chairman and, if there is only one director present and willing to act, he shall be chairman.
43. If no director is willing to act as chairman, or if no director is present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the members present and entitled to
vote shall choose one of their number to be chairman.
44. A director shall, notwithstanding that he is not a member, be entitled to attend and speak
at any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the

if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place,
but no business shall be transacted at an adjourned meeting other than business which might
properly have been transacted at the meeting had the adjournment not taken place. When a
meeting is adjourned for fourteen days or more, at least seven clear daysâ€™ notice shall be given
specifying the time and place of the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business
to be transacted. Otherwise it shall not be necessary to give any such notice.
46. A resolution put to the vote of a meeting shall be decided on a show of hands unless
before, or on the declaration of the result of, the show of hands a poll is duly demanded.
Subject to the provisions of the Act, a poll may be demanded -
(a) by the chairman; or
(b) by at least two members having the right to vote at the meeting; or
(c) by a member or members representing not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of
all the members having the right to vote at the meeting; or
(d) by a member or members holding shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting being
shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one-tenth of the
total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right;
and a demand by a person as proxy for a member shall be the same as a demand by the
47. Unless a poll is duly demanded a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been
carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, or not carried by a particular majority and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the meeting shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in
favour of or against the resolution.
48. The demand for a poll may, before the poll is taken, be withdrawn but only with the consent of the chairman and a demand so withdrawn shall not be taken to have invalidated the
result of a show of hands declared before the demand was made.
49. A poll shall be taken as the chairman directs and he may appoint scrutineers (who need
not be members) and fix a time and place for declaring the result of the poll. The result of the
poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.
51. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be
taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken either forthwith or at
such time and place as the chairman directs not being more than thirty days after the poll is
demanded. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the
transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll was demanded. If a poll

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
is demanded before the declaration of the result of a show of hands and the demand is duly
withdrawn, the meeting shall continue as if the demand had not been made.
52. No notice need be given of a poll not taken forthwith if the time and place at which it is
to be taken are announced at the meeting at which it is demanded. In any other case at least
seven clear daysâ€™ notice shall be given specifying the time and place at which the poll is to be taken.
Votes of members
54. Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands every
member who (being an individual) is present in person or by proxy or (being a corporation)
is present by a duly authorised representative or by proxy, unless the proxy (in either case) or
the representative is himself a member entitled to vote, shall have one vote and on a poll every
member shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
55. In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person
or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the
register of members.
56. A member in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction
(whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder may
vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, curator bonis or other person
authorised in that behalf appointed by that court, and any such receiver, curator bonis or
other person may, on a poll, vote by proxy. Evidence to the satisfaction of the directors of the
authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote shall be deposited at the office,
or at such other place as is specified in accordance with the articles for the deposit of instruments of proxy, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or
adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised and in default the right to vote
shall not be exercisable.
57. No member shall vote at any general meeting or at any separate meeting of the holders of
any class of shares in the company, either in person or by proxy, in respect of any share held
by him unless all moneys presently payable by him in respect of that share have been paid.
58. No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or
adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is tendered, and every vote not disallowed at
the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time shall be referred to the chairman
whose decision shall be final and conclusive.
59. On a poll votes may be given either personally or by proxy. A member may appoint more
than one proxy to attend on the same occasion.
60. The appointment of a proxy shall be executed by or on behalf of the appointor and shall
be in the following form (or in a form as near thereto as circumstances allow or in any other
form which is usual or which the directors may approve) -
â€˜............ PLC/Limited ............ I/We, ............, of ............, being a member/members of the abovenamed company, hereby appoint ............ of ............, or failing him, ............ of ............, as

and an appointment of proxy which is not deposited, delivered or received in a manner so
permitted shall be invalid.
In this regulation and the next, â€˜addressâ€™, in relation to electronic communications, includes
any number or address used for the purposes of such communications.

(in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for taking the poll.
Number of directors
64. Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution, the number of directors (other than
alternate directors) shall not be subject to any maximum but shall be not less than two.
Alternate directors
65. Any director (other than an alternate director) may appoint any other director, or any
other person approved by resolution of the directors and willing to act, to be an alternate
director and may remove from office an alternate director so appointed by him.
66. An alternate director shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of directors and of
all meetings of committees of directors of which his appointor is a member, to attend and
vote at any such meeting at which the director appointing him is not personally present and
generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a director in his absence but shall
not be entitled to receive any remuneration from the company for his services as an alternate
director. But it shall not be necessary to give notice of such a meeting to an alternate director
who is absent from the United Kingdom.
67. An alternate director shall cease to be an alternate director if his appointor ceases to be a
director; but, if a director retires by rotation or otherwise but is reappointed or deemed to
have been reappointed at the meeting at which he retires, any appointment of an alternate
director made by him which was in force immediately prior to his retirement shall continue

articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have
been valid if that alteration had not been made or that direction had not been given. The powers
given by this regulation shall not be limited by any special power given to the directors by
the articles and a meeting of directors at which a quorum is present may exercise all powers
exercisable by the directors.

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826

72. The directors may delegate any of their powers to any committee consisting of one or more
directors. They may also delegate to any managing director or any director holding any other
executive office such of their powers as they consider desirable to be exercised by him. Any such
delegation may be made subject to any conditions the directors may impose, and either collaterally with or to the exclusion of their own powers and may be revoked or altered. Subject to
any such conditions, the proceedings of a committee with two or more members shall be governed by the articles regulating the proceedings of directors so far as they are capable of applying.
Appointment and retirement of directors
73. At the first annual general meeting all the directors shall retire from office, and at every
subsequent annual general meeting one-third of the directors who are subject to retirement
by rotation or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to onethird shall retire from office; but, if there is only one director who is subject to retirement by
rotation, he shall retire.
74. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the directors to retire by rotation shall be those who
have been longest in office since their last appointment or reappointment, but as between
persons who became or were last reappointed directors on the same day those to retire shall
(unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.
75. If the company, at the meeting at which a director retires by rotation, does not fill the
vacancy the retiring director shall, if willing to act, be deemed to have been reappointed unless
at the meeting it is resolved not to fill the vacancy or unless a resolution for the reappointment of the director is put to the meeting and lost.
76. No person other than a director retiring by rotation shall be appointed or reappointed a
director at any general meeting unless -
(a) he is recommended by the directors; or
(b) not less than fourteen nor more than thirty-five clear days before the date appointed for

of his willingness to be appointed or reappointed.
77. Not less than seven nor more than twenty-eight clear days before the date appointed for
holding a general meeting notice shall be given to all who are entitled to receive notice of the
meeting of any person (other than a director retiring by rotation at the meeting) who is recommended by the director for appointment or reappointment as a director at the meeting
or in respect of whom notice has been duly given to the company of the intention to propose
him at the meeting for appointment or reappointment as a director. The notice shall give the
particulars of that person which would, if he were so appointed or reappointed, be required
to be included in the companyâ€™s register of directors.

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
78. Subject as aforesaid, the company may by ordinary resolution appoint a person who is
willing to act to be a director either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director and may also
determine the rotation in which any additional directors are to retire.
79. The directors may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director, either to fill a
vacancy or as an additional director, provided that the appointment does not cause the number of directors to exceed any number fixed by or in accordance with the articles as the
maximum number of directors. A director so appointed shall hold office only until the next
following annual general meeting and shall not be taken into account in determining the
directors who are to retire by rotation at the meeting. If not reappointed at such annual general meeting, he shall vacate office at the conclusion thereof.
80. Subject as aforesaid, a director who retires at an annual general meeting may, if willing to
act, be reappointed. If he is not reappointed, he shall retain office until the meeting appoints
someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the end of the meeting.

directors from meetings of directors held during that period and the directors resolve that his

them in connection with their attendance at meetings of directors or committees of directors
or general meetings or separate meetings of the holders of any class of shares or of debentures

Directorsâ€™ appointments and interests
84. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the directors may appoint one or more of their number to the office of managing director or to any other executive office under the company and
may enter into an agreement or arrangement with any director for his employment by the
company or for the provision by him of any services outside the scope of the ordinary duties
of a director. Any such appointment, agreement or arrangement may be made upon such
terms as the directors determine and they may remunerate any such director for his services
as they think fit. Any appointment of a director to an executive office shall terminate if he
ceases to be a director but without prejudice to any claim to damages for breach of the contract of service between the director and the company. A managing director and a director
holding any other executive office shall not be subject to retirement by rotation.
85. Subject to the provisions of the Act, and provided that he has disclosed to the directors
the nature and extent of any material interest of his, a director notwithstanding his office -
(a) may be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction or arrangement with the
company or in which the company or in which the company is otherwise interested;
(b) may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to any transaction or
arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, any body corporate promoted by the company
or in which the company is otherwise interested; and
(c) shall not, by reason of his office, be accountable to the company for any benefit which he
derives from any such office or employment or from any such transaction or arrangement or
from any interest in any such body corporate and no such transaction or arrangement shall
be liable to be avoided on the ground of any such interest or benefit.
86. For the purposes of regulation 85 -
(a) a general notice given to the directors that a director is to be regarded as having an interest of the nature and extent specified in the notice in any transaction or arrangement in which
a specified person or class of persons is interested shall be deemed to be a disclosure that the
director has an interest in any such transaction of the nature and extent so specified; and
(b) an interest of which a d irector has no knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to expect
him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an interest of his.
Directorsâ€™ gratuities and pensions
87. The directors may provide benefits, whether by the payment of gratuities or pensions or
by insurance or otherwise, for any director who has held but no longer holds any executive
office or employment with the company or with any body corporate which is or has been a
subsidiary of the company or a predecessor in business of the company or of any such subsidiary, and for any member of his family (including a spouse and a former spouse) or any
person who is or was dependent on him, and may (as well before as after he ceases to hold
such office or employment) contribute to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or
provision of any such benefit.
Proceedings of directors
88. Subject to the provisions of the articles, the directors may regulate their proceedings as
they think fit. A director may, and the secretary at the request of a director shall, call a meeting

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
of the directors. It shall not be necessary to give notice of a meeting to a director who is absent
from the United Kingdom. Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of
votes. In the case of an equality of votes, the chairman shall have a second or casting vote.
A director who is also an alternate director shall be entitled in the absence of his appointor to
a separate vote on behalf of his appointor in addition to his own vote.
89. The quorum for the transaction of the business of the directors may be fixed by the directors and unless so fixed at any other number shall be two. A person who holds office only
as an alternate director shall, if his appointor is not present, be counted in the quorum.
90. The continuing directors or a sole continuing director may act notwithstanding any
vacancies in their number, but, if the number of directors is less than the number fixed as the
quorum, the continuing directors or director may act only for the purpose of filling vacancies
or of calling a general meeting.
91. The directors may appoint one of their number to be the chairman of the board of directors and may at any time remove him from that office. Unless he is unwilling to do so, the
director so appointed shall preside at every meeting of directors at which he is present. But if
there is no director holding that office, or if the director holding it is unwilling to preside or
is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for the meeting, the directors
present may appoint one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.
92. All acts done by a meeting of directors, or of a committee of directors, or by a person acting
as a director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was a defect in the
appointment of any director or that any of them were disqualified from holding office, or had
vacated office, or were not entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person had been duly
appointed and was qualified and had continued to be a director and had been entitled to vote.
93. A resolution in writing signed by all the directors entitled to receive notice of a meeting
of directors or of a committee of directors shall be as valid and effectual as it if had been
passed at a meeting of directors or (as the case may be) a committee of directors duly convened and held and may consist of several documents in the like form each signed by one or
more directors; but a resolution signed by an alternate director need not also be signed by his
appointor and, if it is sig ned by a director who has appointed an alternate director, it need not
be signed by the alternate director in that capacity.
94. Save as otherwise provided by the articles, a director shall not vote at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors on any resolution concerning a matter in which he has,
directly or indirectly, an interest or duty which is material and which conflicts or may conflict
with the interests of the company unless his interest or duty arises only because the case falls
within one or more of the following paragraphs -
(a) the resolution relates to the giving to him of a guarantee, security, or indemnity in respect
of money lent to, or an obligation incurred by him for the benefit of, the company or any of
its subsidiaries;
(b) the resolution relates to the giving to a third party of a guarantee, security, or indemnity
in respect of an obligation of the company or any of its subsidiaries for which the director
has assumed responsibility in whole or part and whether alone or jointly with others under a
guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security;
(c) his interest arises by virtue of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe for any shares,
debentures, or other securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or by virtue of his
being, or intending to become, a participant in the underwriting or sub-underwriting of an

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
offer of any such shares, debentures, or other securities by the company or any of its subsidiaries for subscription, purchase or exchange;
(d) the resolution relates in any way to a retirement benefits scheme which has been
approved, or is conditional upon approval, by the Board of Inland Revenue for taxation
For the purposes of this regulation, an interest of a person who is, for any purpose of the Act
(excluding any statutory modification thereof not in force when this regulation becomes
binding on the company), connected with a director shall be treated as an interest of the
director and, in relation to an alternate director, an interest of his appointor shall be treated
as an interest of the alternate director without prejudice to any interest which the alternate
director has otherwise.
95. A director shall not be counted in the quorum present at a meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.
96. The company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax to any extent, either generally
or in respect of any particular matter, any provision of the articles prohibiting a director from
voting at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors.
97. Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment of two or more
directors to offices or employments with the company or any body corporate in which the
company is interested the proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each director separately and (provided he is not for another reason precluded from voting) each of
the directors concerned shall be entitled to vote and be counted in the quorum in respect of
each resolution except that concerning his own appointment.
98. If a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors as to the right
of a director to vote, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to
the chairman of the meeting and his ruling in relation to any director other than himself shall
be final and conclusive.
99. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the secretary shall be appointed by the directors
for such term, at such remuneration and upon such conditions as they may think fit; and any
secretary so appointed may be removed by them.
100. The directors shall cause minutes to be made in books kept for the purpose -
(a) of all appointments of officers made by the directors; and
(b) of all proceedings at meetings of the company, of the holders of any class of shares in the
company, and of the directors, and of committees of directors, including the names of the
directors present at each such meeting.
101. The seal shall only be used by the authority of the directors or of a committee of directors authorised by the directors. The directors may determine who shall sign any instrument

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
to which the seal is affixed and unless otherwise so determined it shall be signed by a director
and by the secretary or by a second director.
102. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the company may by ordinary resolution declare
dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend shall
exceed the amount recommended by the directors.
103. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the directors may pay interim dividends if it appears
to them that they are justified by the profits of the company available for distribution. If the
share capital is divided into different classes, the directors may pay interim dividends on
shares which confer deferred or non-preferred rights with regard to dividend as well as on
shares which confer preferential rights with regard to dividend, but no interim dividend shall
be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any
preferential dividend is in arrear. The directors may also pay at intervals settled by them any
dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution
justify the payment. Provided the directors act in good faith they shall not incur any liability
to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful
payment of an interim dividend on any shares having deferred or non-preferred rights.
104. Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be
declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is
paid. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on
the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is
paid; but, if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a
particular date, that share shall rank for dividend accordingly.
105. A general meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation of the directors,
direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets and, where any
difficulty arises in regard to the distribution, the directors may settle the same and in particular may issue fractional certificates and fix the value for distribution of any assets and may
determine that cash sha ll be paid to any member upon the footing of the value so fixed in
order to adjust the rights of members and may vest any assets in trustees.
106. Any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be paid by cheque sent by
post to the registered address of the person entitled or, if two or more persons are the holders
of the share or are jointly entitled to it by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder,
to the registered address of that one of those persons who is first named in the register of
members or to such person and to such address as the person or persons entitled may in writing direct. Every cheque shall be made payable to the order of the person or persons entitled
or to such other person as the person or persons entitled may in writing direct and payment
of the cheque shall be a good discharge to the company. Any joint holder or other person
jointly entitled to a share as aforesaid may give receipts for any dividend or other moneys
payable in respect of the share.
107. No dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share shall bear interest against the
company unless otherwise provided by the rights attached to the share.
108. Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for twelve years from the date when it
became due for payment shall, if the directors so resolve, be forfeited and cease to remain
owing by the company.

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
109. No member shall (as such) have any right of inspecting any accounting records or other
book or document of the company except as conferred by statute or authorised by the directors or by ordinary resolution of the company.
Capitalisation of profits
110. The directors may with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the company -
(a) subject as hereinafter provided, resolve to capitalise any undivided profits of the company
not required for paying any preferential dividend (whether or not they are available for distribution) or any sum standing to the credit of the companyâ€™s share premium account or
capital redemption reserve;
(b) appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the members who would have been entitled to it if it were distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions and apply
such sum on their behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts, if any, for the time
being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or in paying up in full unissued shares
or debentures of the company of a nominal amount equal to that sum, and allot the shares or
debentures credited as fully paid to those members, or as they may direct, in those proportions, or partly in one way and partly in the other: but the share premium account, the capital redemption reserve, and any profits which are not available for distribution may, for the
purposes of this regulation, only be applied in paying up unissued shares to be allotted to
members credited as fully paid;
(c) make such provision by the issue of fractional certificates or by payment in cash or otherwise as they determine in the case of shares or debentures becoming distributable under this
regulation in fractions; and
(d) authorise any person to enter on behalf of all the members concerned into an agreement
with the company providing for the allotment to them respectively, credited as fully paid, of
any shares or debentures to which they are entitled upon such capitalisation, any agreement
made under such authority being binding on all such members.
111. Any notice to be given to or by any person pursuant to the articles (other than a notice calling a meeting of the directors) shall be in writing or shall be given using electronic communications to an address for the time being notified for that purpose to the person giving the notice.
In this regulation, â€˜addressâ€™, in relation to electronic communications, includes any number
or address used for the purposes of such communications.
112. The company may give any notice to a member either personally or by sending it by post
in a prepaid envelope addressed to the member at his registered address or by leaving it at that
address or by giving it using electronic communications to an address for the time being
notified to the company by the member. In the case of joint holders of a share, all notices shall
be given to the joint holder whose name stands first in the register of members in respect of
the joint holding and notice so given shall be sufficient notice to all the joint holders. A member whose registered address is not within the United Kingdom and who gives to the company
an address within the United Kingdom at which notices may be given to him, or an address

Appendix 2 Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/805) as amended by SI 2007/2541 and SI 2007/2826
to which notices may be sent using electronic communications, shall be entitled to have
notices given to him at that address, but otherwise no such member shall be entitled to receive
any notice from the company.
In this regulation and the next, â€˜addressâ€™, in relation to electronic communications, includes
any number or address used for the purposes of such communications.
113. A member present, either in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the company or of
the holders of any class of shares in the company shall be deemed to have received notice of
the meeting and, where requisite, of the purposes for which it was called.
114. Every person who becomes entitled to a share shall be bound by any notice in respect of
that share which, before his name is entered in the register of members, has been duly given
to a person from whom he derives his title.
115. Proof that an envelope containing a notice was properly addressed, prepaid and posted
shall be conclusive evidence that that the notice was given. Proof that a notice contained in
an electronic communication was sent in accordance with guidance issued by the Institute of
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators shall be conclusive evidence that the notice was
given. A notice shall be deemed to be given at the expiration of 48 hours after the envelope
containing it was posted or, in the case of a notice contained in an electronic communication,
at the expiration of 48 hours after the time it was sent.
116. A notice may be given by the company to the persons entitled to a share in consequence
of the death or bankruptcy of a member by sending or delivering it, in any manner authorised
by the articles for the giving of notice to a member, addressed to them by name, or by the title
of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt or by any like description at the
address, if any, within the United Kingdom supplied for that purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled. Until such an address has been supplied, a notice may be given in any
manner in which it might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred.
Winding up
117. If the company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the company and any other sanction required by the Act, divide among the members
in specie the whole or any part of the assets of the company and may, for that purpose, value
any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes of members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any
part of the assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the members as he with the
like sanction determines, but no member shall be compelled to accept any assets upon which
there is a liability.
118. Subject to the provisions of the Act but without prejudice to any indemnity to which a
director may otherwise be entitled, every director or other officer or auditor of the company
shall be indemnified out of the assets of the company against any liability incurred by him in
defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour
or in which he is acquitted or in connection with any application in which relief is granted to
him by the court from liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in
relation to the affairs of the company.
